Mysteries* in the "Chinese Physical Book Volume 3." It

*Chapter 213: Another Look* *aka.* End of Volume 1.

This is a ***Bullet Point Paraphrasing Summary*** by Windvally, not
the complete translation of the story.

 

-  In the Year 1346, Leonard Mitchell was testing his Sleepless
  abilities and ended up rolling down the staircase of Blackthorn
  Security Company like a meatball. 
-  Dunn Smith was a Sequence 9 Sleepless for 3 years, a Sequence 8
  Midnight Poet for 9 years. He used over 2 weeks to adapt and control
  his Sequence 7 Nightmare powers. 
-  Dunn is bringing Leonard to answer a request for help from Tingen
  University Department of History. An associate professor Mrs. Sinel is
  experiencing auditory hallucinations and having the same nightmare
  every night. This will be Leonard's debut, officially getting in touch
  with supernatural cases. Mrs. Sinel is a believer of the Evernight
  Goddess, thus Blackthorn took the case even though Tingen's University
  District is under the jurisdiction of Machinery Hivemind.
  
-  Rule of Jurisdiction: When a case does not involve believers of
  multiple Gods (meaning all involved individuals believe in only one of
  the Orthodox Gods), Supernatural Cases' management rights are
  delegated based on religion and not based on district.
  
-  Nighthawks are responsible for Tingen City's North District, West
  District, and Golden Maple District. 
-  Daly Simone (on that day in the year 1346) wore a black color
  schemed shirt, trousers, and jacket. Looks smooth and clean but not
  overly masculine. She wore a Smokey Eyeshadow makeup, a style that was
  invented by Emperor Roselle and spread from Intis to the Loen Kingdom.
  Her clothing in addition to her unique aura, making her appear overall
  gloomy and cold as if a female ghost walking out of a folktale.
  
-  Cuttlefish knifing us with Daly teasing Leonard, Dunn said don't
  tease the young ones, Daly rebuked with "not the young ones, that
  means you would be okay?" Dunn changing subjects. 
-  Daly insisted on going with Dunn and Leonard, commenting on how her
  abilities complement Dunn's, while Leonard is the extra one that's
  useless as he's just a "lower sequence Dunn". 
-  Leonard is surprised why Daly is a lot quieter on their way to the
  University, only occasionally making fun of Dunn. Leonard inferred
  that Daly has some things on her mind. 
-  The University District is divided into two parts by Khoy River, one
  side is Tingen University, the other side is Khoy University.
  
-  Mrs. Sinel is a middle-aged female who wears a pair of gold-rimmed
  glasses with small chains attached. She has heavy bags under her eyes,
  her skin appears rather pale and gloomy, her whole condition doesn't
  seem too good. 
-  Mrs. Sinel has been having very similar nightmares every night since
  two weeks ago. In this nightmare, she's placed within a battlefield
  filled with corpses. The smell of blood that permeates the battlefield
  is extremely real, she could even remember the smell at this moment.
  
-  Dunn: Similar? Not "The Same"? Mrs. Sinel stated the nightmares
  sometimes are the same battlefield scene, sometimes the nightmare
  "progresses forward". 
-  Initially, it was just corpses littered everywhere on the ground,
  blood-soaked the place full. After that, gradually the sky was painted
  red as well. And without me noticing, countless wounds and cuts
  appeared on my body as well, blood pouring out from each and every one
  of them nonstop. At which point I was scared awake. 
-  No matter how I sleep, when I sleep, where I sleep, this dream will
  always appear. Just since a few days ago, I even started hearing
  shouts and screams of agony under broad daylight. Almost as if two
  armies that I could not perceive are fighting around me. Since a few
  days ago, even in my dreams, figures are gradually manifesting in the
  distance as well, under the blood-red sky. 
-  Daly walked around Mrs. Sinel's room a bit. her eyes first turned
  gray-white, then turned again into a colorless state.
  
-  Daly leaned close to Dunn's ears and whispered her results, making
  Dunn feel uneasy about their body position lol. 
-  Two weeks ago, Mrs. Sinel bought a batch of artifacts that
  supposedly originated from The 4th Epoch. Recently she has been
  constantly studying and researching these artifacts, trying to
  determine if they are indeed from The 4th Epoch. 
-  There were many artifacts, but one caught Dunn's eye immediately - A
  dark golden-colored coin. 
-  This dark golden-colored coin: 
-  Size approximately the same as a 1£ gold coin 
-  One side is comparatively more simple designed; The protruding
  patterns constituted a war chariot 
-  The other side is rather complicated; Its pattern is a combination
  of several different parts 
-  Mrs. Sinel "It's a money coin from The Tudor Empire in The 4th
  Epoch" (Dunn agrees) 
-  The complicated side: The main component part is a Crown with a Cape
  that falls down naturally under it, attached to the crown. The lower
  part of the Crown is surrounded by 5 symbols. Among those 5 symbols,
  the one on the furthest left, left of the cape, and parallel to the
  cape, is a "layers of doors" drawn using simple lines. The one on the
  furthest right is a disk, its surface is divided into 12 spaces,
  making it resemble a clock, but there's only one clock hand in the
  center. In addition, those 12 spaces aren't evenly distributed. They
  are of varying sizes with either dark or bright coloration. Giving
  viewers a very uneven, unbalanced feeling. 
-  Aside from those two symbols that clearly stood higher than the
  other three, the remaining three symbols are located on the very
  bottom. They are parallel with each other, in the order of from left
  to right they are: a vertical eye made from many small and thin
  patterns, five fingers (normal humanoid length difference) without the
  hand part - ring finger and little finger are curled up, the other
  three fingers are naturally spread out as if symbolizing the hour
  hand, minute hand, and second hand, and lastly a door that's being
  split in the middle by a vertical long sword. 

 

-  Dunn stated the coin has problems and needs to be purified by holy
  water and ritual. Mrs. Sinel stated if the purification is
  unsuccessful she's donating the coin to the church. 
-  Dunn wrapped the coin in three layers of white paper, on each paper
  he drew an Evernight Goddess's holy emblem. 
-  After Dunn and Co. left, Mrs. Sinel's mind manifested Dunn's face
  without her realizing it, she focused on his gray pupils, as if gazing
  onto a clam and deep lake. She fell asleep till noon without a
  nightmare. 
-  After the case is solved. When they are chatting and writing the
  report, Dunn asked Daly why she's so quiet today, Leonard listened.
  
-  Daly raised up a piece of white paper and block it in front of her
  and said "I'm pregnant". Dunn and Leonard simultaneously spit their
  coffee which gets blocked by the paper. 
-  Daly stated she was just joking and said it's just that she's ready
  for sequence 7 advancement. By then she would be high enough to be
  appointed captain at a Different Location. 
-  Dunn, without any understanding of the situation, supported her
  decision. Daly only watched quietly as he's talking.
