## Chapter 502: The Scene in Azik's Memories 

Pa!

Klein stretched out his hand and caught the slightly heavy letter.

The large skeleton messenger didn't stay, and it immediately
disintegrated into a fountain of bones. One bone after another fell to
the deck and disappeared, as though it didn't want to stay a second
longer.

With the letter firmly in his hand, Klein didn't lower his head to
examine it. Instead, he instinctively turned around and looked at the
wooden staircase leading to the first-class cabins.

He saw Donna and Denton with their eyes wide and mouths agape, as though
they wanted to scream at the sight of the scene, but everything they saw
was over before they could make a sound. As a result, they even wondered
if they were hallucinating.

*The children who eat the special cured meat in Damir Harbor gain
temporary Spirit Vision to a certain degree...* Klein's brows twitched
slightly as he raised his left hand's index finger vertically and placed
it against his mouth to silence the two young ones, just like he did
while the murloc hunt was happening.

The already rather tall Donna immediately raised her hand and covered
her mouth. She nodded in fear and excitement, indicating that she
understood.

When she looked diagonally down, she saw that her brother was still in a
daze. She quickly grabbed his arm and pushed his hand against his mouth.

Cleves and Cecile sensed that something was wrong with them. They
stopped and looked at Klein, but they discovered nothing.

Facing their stares, Klein calmly nodded and continued walking to his
room.

A gold coin had appeared in his hand without anyone realizing. It was
tossed up, and it tumbled around as though it possessed life.

Ding!

The gold coin landed with a number facing up, indicating a negative
result.

This meant that the tiny episode wouldn't be detrimental to Klein.

*Seriously, the current messenger isn't polite at all. It's not like the
previous one who would tap my shoulder or nudge my body to give an
advance warning, or just convert my surroundings into a spiritual world
to prevent ordinary people from seeing him...* Klein lampooned as he
took out his key and opened the door.

He sat down on the edge of the low bed, lit a candle with only half its
length remaining, and opened Mr. Azik's response letter.

As he pulled out the items inside, the first one that caught his eye was
the Black Emperor card.

Looking at that face which pissed him off, Klein let out a breath of
relief and eased his worries.

He wasn't afraid that Mr. Azik wouldn't return it to him, as he had that
minimum level of trust. After all, the potion formula and corresponding
rituals could be copied, and only the convergence properties of
high-level materials couldn't be imitated. And since this was clearly
not Azik's pathway, nor was it one of the switchable paths available to
him, so a powerhouse like him had no need for it.

Klein was worried that the messenger would be robbed, losing the Card of
Blasphemy which would help him tremendously while in his Spirit Body
state.

This wasn't impossible. The number of strange creatures in the spirit
world was hard to count, so it isn't hard to end up having a few who
were good at locating messengers and robbing them.

The Black Emperor card was returned along with the copper whistle from
the Numinous Episcopate.

After temporarily putting away these two items, Klein unfolded the
important letter and read Azik's reply.

"...That card that depicts the Black Emperor reminds me of certain
scenes. The tall-as-a-mountain Blood Emperor who wore a red cape with
'His' eyes being abnormally crazy, containing almost zero reasoning. He
was on the brink of losing control. There was the true Black Emperor who
had revived. 'He' sat on a gigantic throne, overlooking the land.

"When I looked up at them, I lost consciousness when the Blood Emperor
looked at me.

"I should have, in some form, participated in the War of the Four
Emperors, but the exact details still require me to recall them. Perhaps
it was because of an injury from back then that caused me to lose my
memories again and again as I repeatedly died and reawakened.

"The legend of Death's treasure trove in the Berserk Sea doesn't ring
any bells. Perhaps I'll be able to sense something and be naturally
attracted to it when I travel to the Southern Continent by boat and pass
through that sea.

"The experiences of the owner of that copper whistle resemble that of an
Undying's ritual, but there are also clear differences. I can sense evil
auras and the premonition of danger. I believe the owner of the copper
whistle is in a strange and terrifying state.

"It's best that you don't blow that copper whistle and summon the
messenger. This will bring extreme danger. We can make further attempts
when I fully recover my memories and figure out what that experience
really means.

"The feather left behind by the copper whistle's owner that you
mentioned can be used in the domain of the undead. It's a unique
material that's rich in spirituality. When I recall more, I'll organize
the knowledge of some rituals and charms you can use with it for you.
Speaking of this matter, I recall that you'd asked me about the method
for ridding the mental corruption of a Beyonder characteristic. This
will likely need more time. At the very least, I'm still a blank slate
in this aspect.

"Also, I vaguely remember that in the Southern Continent, there are
strange creatures called Feathermen.

"It's best to seal that card; otherwise, it might attract powerful
enemies and many disasters. I can give you some techniques. This isn't
too difficult. First, an improved wall of spirituality..."

*As expected, the Card of Blasphemy has a convergence effect upon
activation... It's a good thing that I've left it above the gray fog in
the past... According to Mr. Azik's descriptions, he shouldn't be an
amnesiac Death. Otherwise, he wouldn't have looked up to the Blood
Emperor and the Black Emperor... It's likely that he's a son of Death,
participating in the War of the Four Emperors by accompanying that
deity. Unfortunately, he suffered from severe injuries...* As he
thought, Klein produced a flame and burned the letter.

Then, he tried the sealing technique and practiced what Azik had taught
him in the letter.

After doing all of this, he held a ritual and brought the Black Emperor
card and the Numinous Episcopate's copper whistle into the mysterious
space above the gray fog, eliminating all possibilities of any
accidents.

There was no doubt that Klein had no wish to suddenly meet the King of
the Five Seas, Nast, at sea.

†

Early in the morning, the sun rose above the horizon and dyed it golden.

Klein went to the not-so-well-stocked second-class buffet cafeteria and
ate two slices of toast with bacon and butter and drank a cup of lemon
tea.

After filling his stomach, he went to the deck to breathe in the fresh
air and enjoy the beautiful early-morning scenery.

Then, he saw a drunk Captain Elland returning, his straight sword
swaying.

Thinking back to last night's incident, Klein came over and said without
a smile, "Good morning.

"White Shark didn't cause you any trouble, right?

"He should be able to determine that I'm a passenger of the White
Agate."

Dressed in a dark red coat, Elland took off his ship-shaped hat and
laughed.

"This is his own problem.

"Actually, he wanted you to pay half the repair fees for the bar
counter, but that isn't much. It's just a few soli. I happened to win
six pounds last night and gave him some extra tips, and that was the end
of it."

*Captain, are you afraid that a crazy adventurer like me will blow the
whole thing up just for the sake of face, so you ended up choosing to
bear the compensation?* Klein was silent for a few seconds.

"I understand."

Then, he turned and walked back to the bow, leaving two soft words:
"Thank you."

When Klein returned to his original position, he felt the sea breeze
blowing against his face. He slowly let out a breath, feeling that it
was too goddamn hard to force a persona.

After enjoying the wind for a while, he was about to return to the cabin
when two figures suddenly appeared beside him. They were Donna and
Denton.

Cecile, who was in charge of protecting them, was a few paces away.

Donna had obviously not slept well last night. Her eyes were puffy, and
her face was gloomy, but she was in high spirits. She was obviously
imitating Klein's taking in of the scenery, but her eyes were darting
around nimbly.

Just as Denton, who was in a similar state as her, wanted to speak, she
spoke first.

"Uncle, who was that last-last night?"

As she spoke, she looked ahead without turning her head, but her body
was trembling slightly, as though she was recalling the scene she had
seen.

"It was a messenger. You can think of him as a postman." Klein also
didn't look at the two little kids, as though he was talking about what
he had for breakfast.

"Messenger?" Denton almost lost control of the volume of his voice.

"The world is so huge, so there's bound to be some strange creatures in
this world. Trust me, although this creature looks very ferocious and
terrifying, it's actually very gentle and professional... It just sent
me a letter on behalf of a friend who's far away," Klein explained
slightly, trying to describe the four-meter-tall messenger as pitiful,
weak, and helpless.

After a night of panic, and because she hadn't been harmed in any way,
Donna was much calmer. Her eyes lit up as she said, "Well, that's
amazing!

"It's like listening to a story!"

"Very cool!" Denton also expressed his opinion.

Then, he puzzledly asked, "But why didn't anyone else see it? No one had
any response!"

"That's because your hearts are pure." Klein smiled.

This was a white lie. After all, he couldn't just say that it was a
problem with the special cured meat. That would only make the two
curious little fellows fail to resist making attempts.

This way, ignoring the fact that ingesting large amounts of it would
cause one to fall ill, just randomly having Spirit Vision activated was
a very dangerous matter. Even though Klein could now sustain the
consumption of his Spirit Vision for a long period of time, he
ultimately didn't dare keep it open. Sometimes, seeing things he
shouldn't have seen could lead to madness or death!

"C-can we have a messenger of our own?" Donna asked, curious and
excited.

"That will depend on luck," Klein answered simply and calmly.

He couldn't help but lampoon inwardly, *I don't even have a messenger of
my own!*

In order to obtain a messenger, he had to design an accurate summoning
ritual and prepare the corresponding spirit world creature contract.
This was a specialized field of knowledge, and randomly doing so could
easily summon something bad, so Klein didn't dare to recklessly try it.

"Yeah. Yeah." Donna looked forward to it.

Then, she said in a tiny voice, "Uncle, we'll keep this a secret for
you."

Beside her, Denton nodded solemnly.

At this moment, a new passenger that intended to board in Damir Harbor
carried his suitcase as he walked onto the deck.

After sending the telegram, Blazing Danitz considered that the Captain
might instruct him on certain matters. So he decided to cut the holiday
short and await orders at the capital of the Rorsted Archipelago.

Through his own channels, he had obtained a ticket, put on a wig,
blackened his eyebrows, and easily boarded the White Agate, waiting for
the liner to blow its whistle.

*Sigh, as Emperor Roselle said, capable people always have to do a
little bit more work...* As Danitz walked towards the cabin, he looked
around leisurely. Suddenly, he saw a familiar figure.

It was a young adventurer in a black coat, gentle in appearance and mad
in nature. He was standing at the bow of the ship, beaming at him like a
gentleman.

The muscles in Danitz's face began to stiffen.

Author's Notes:

Still no change... However, apart from the rest at the end of this
section, the rest of the time has been kept stable updated, which is
worthy of praise (myself).

Well, let's say the mystery itself. The third "Traveler" has been
written for almost 10 days, and the plot has been progressing slowly.
This is actually the effect I want to achieve. Klein broke away from the
monster room and entered an ocean where there are not so many bosses, so
he doesn't always alert and dangerous all the time. He doesn't need to
be so depressed any more, and the rhythm will definitely be relatively
slow.

With the title of "Traveler", I hope to show you the local customs,
interesting folk customs, extraordinary creatures, and more sequence
performances in different parts of the mysterious world, so as to make
the whole world fuller and more real. Of course, there will certainly be
conflicts in the plot, and there will be dangers and excitement, but
they will not be so dense. They will be reasonably distributed in Klein
to look for the mermaids. During the journey of the Faceless, the
cooperation and conflicts with the Seven Pirate Admirals and Four Pirate
Kings, and the legend of the treasure will also be embedded in such
experiences like pearls. In short, the name of Gehrman Sparrow will be
spread on the sea.

In fact, it's the most difficult to write a plain and soothing plot.
It's necessary to consider the rhythm before and after. It's necessary
to ensure that it's interesting, not boring, and not lacking. Recently,
my typewriting speed has slow down a lot. Plus exercise three times a
week, I really have no ability to add more in a short time.

Finally, the new month is coming, please encourage me to write the third
volume better and better\~

In fact, I have no interest in the competition. A small part of it is my
laziness. Most of it is my love for everyone's money. No one's money
comes from the strong wind. Reading the books, collect some monthly
tickets, and vote for them. Well, no more money needs to be wasted. Only
when I have enough spare capacity can I consider the reward. I don't
want to burden the book lovers who like me to support me. Isn't its
better for everyone to read quietly and happily?

If one day I won the first place in the competition, I hope that because
we have a lot of good people, we have a deep foundation. We eats hot
pot, sings songs and takes the first place easily. Well, dreams are
still needed, right? And for such a dream, I must write better and never
satisfied. I will always challenge!

OK, then ask for a monthly ticket again, We can do what we can. The main
thing is to put it in the front. The recommendation effect is good.
There will be more subscriptions. That's all small money!

Well, today's update is still the same, 12:30 at noon and 7:00 at night.
