## Chapter 645: "Gifts"

After Louis Berry left the coffee area, Kolobo breathed a sigh of
relief. He removed his sunglasses, retrieved the 5,000 verl d'or, and
counted it again.

His gut told him this deal would work out. That's the only reason he
dared to risk coming to the Matani Import and Export Shop. Still, his
whole body had been trembling with fear. He couldn't even keep his eyes
open most of the time, and his hands were shaking so badly that he was
surprised it was legible.

Trouble always waits until it's ready to explode, he thought, clutching
his sunglasses.

He stood up and headed for the door.

Something was wrong. He could feel it. His body tensed with some kind of
danger sense he couldn't explain.

His heart raced as he scanned the place professionally, trying to
pinpoint the danger. Kolobo's footsteps changed---sometimes fast,
sometimes slow. He'd zip off in one direction only to stop short a few
paces later.

Kolobo took in the morning sun, the quiet shop that had just opened its
doors, and the handful of customers scattered about. Not a single pair
of eyes seemed fixed on him, and there was no one lurking in the
shadows, observing his every move.

Yet, following his instincts, his feet carried him back to the coffee
shop area. That's where he finally stopped, in front of the bathroom
sign.

Two years as a Beyonder taught Kolobo the most important lesson: trust
your gut. Without thinking, he yanked open the heavy wooden door and
walked inside.

The Matani Import and Export Shop wasn't some back-alley dive. This
restroom was big. Three urinals, three stalls, and gas lamps flickered
on the clean tile.

Kolobo headed to the sink to splash cold water on his face. Maybe that
would shake this weird danger feeling that was creeping all over him.

As he looked up, a face stared back at him in the mirror.

But it wasn't his.

The face was freakishly white. The guy looked late twenties, with light
brown skin and eyes that flashed a dark, sickly green. He stared at
Kolobo with dead, cold eyes.

Kolobo's brain short-circuited as recognition hit.

Twanaku Tupián, the only Prisoner pathway Beyonder on their patrol team.
The guy had become a Sequence 6 Zombie last year.

He was also the first guy to ever make Kolobo's skin crawl. If he told
anyone else, he gut told him he'd end up dead!

When Lumian asked Kolobo to spill the beans about the Prisoner pathway
Beyonder on his team, something about it felt wrong. He'd almost bailed
on the whole deal. He'd counted that huge 50,000 sum not out of distrust
but because he needed time to think, to weigh the risk.

He decided to trust his gut, but he hadn't told Lumian about this
feeling, this fear of Tupián...

And now, here Twanaku Tupián was, reflected in the mirror.

*This is a Sequence 5 Wraith power. When did he advance?* Kolobo
could barely think over the growing horror. Suddenly, his body felt like
it'd been dropped into an icy lake.

Twanaku Twanaku's face in the mirror vanished.

Kolobo could barely move. An icy coldness gripped him, the kind that
chilled you to the bone.

It wasn't his own hands that were moving---they lifted without him
wanting them to. A voice drifted through his ears, flat and emotionless.

"Looks like my cover is blown. You were actually asked to provide my
information.

"I'll get out of Port Pylos, but I'm going to leave two gifts for Lumian
Lee."

*What did that even mean? What kind of gift? And who the heck was Lumian
Lee?* Kolobo's thoughts were a jumbled mess. His own hands were
tightening around his neck.

Then, with a sickening jolt, he realized what "gift" the voice was
talking about.

Twanaku Tupián was going to kill him and leave a gift---his dead body!

*But he said two gifts. What was the other one?*

___

In the four-story beige building of the patrol team.

Camus sipped his Highlander coffee and read the West Balam Telegraph,
contemplating the deal between Kolobo and Louis Berry.

If successful, as an intermediary, he would receive 20% of the amount.

*Knock, knock, knock.* A gentle rap echoed on Camus's office
door.

"Please come in." Though not particularly young, Camus had ample
experience, leading one of the patrol team's operations teams. If there
were a vacancy for the vice-captain position, his only competition would
be Twanaku Tupián of the Prisoner pathway.

The Southern Continent was a chaotic place, especially in an area torn
between multiple factions. Whether dealing with the bloodthirsty Rose
School of Thought, the ominous Numinous Episcopate, ambitious
adventurers, spies from various countries, or missionaries, danger
lurked at every corner. Some would take the initiative to assassinate
patrol team members, while others would rebel and escape. Meticulous
planning was not uncommon, and even the patrol team members found
themselves as targets. Consequently, the patrol team faced casualties
every year, leading to a constant need for new recruits.

Encountering more attacks had its advantages. Victorious confrontations
often yielded valuable items and Beyonder-related ingredients. Many of
the patrol team's advancement formulas and potions were acquired in such
situations, creating a noteworthy trend.

Compared to cities of similar size in the Northern Continent, Port Pylos
had an even greater number of official Beyonders, especially
Mid-Sequence Beyonders. However, they lacked higher levels of power or
corresponding Sealed Artifacts.

Camus found himself in a tight spot financially due to his rapid
advancement outpacing his cousins.

Arriving in Matani State and Port Pylos as a Sequence 9 Arbiter, he had
swiftly climbed to a Sequence 7 Justiciar in just five years. His goal
was to advance to Sequence 6 and become a Judge, and he had recently
been gathering the funds to purchase the necessary materials. If the
opportunity to become a vice-captain arose, the patrol team would
certainly contribute resources to aid his advancement.

Spoils of war weren't always suitable for him; sometimes, he needed to
trade with teammates or sell them to the patrol team for money. He
patiently waited for the potion formulas and Beyonder ingredients
corresponding to his pathway to appear.

The patrol team, being relatively new, hadn't accumulated substantial
reserves. Camus needed to find a way to purchase practical mystical
items, regularly replenish charms, potions, and other essentials to stay
prepared against assassinations and conflicts.

In such a situation, money was naturally scarce.

Chaos was a path to hell but also a ladder to the top!

Pugilist Sow entered.

With his brown braids gently swaying, Sow, clad in a sky-blue shirt and
beige pants, approached Camus with one hand in his pocket, smiling as he
asked, "Have you seen Kolobo? I need to discuss something with him."

Camus had already prepared a reason.

"He went to the Import and Export Shop to buy coffee beans."

Sow tersely acknowledged, "Then I'll wait for him to return."

"What's up?" Camus asked casually.

Sow took two steps forward and smiled.

"There's an investigation we would like to involve him in. Maybe he can
uncover clues that others can't."

"You bastards, aren't you concerned about Kolobo getting hurt?" Camus
replied with amusement, lifting his coffee and taking a sip.

At that moment, Sow withdrew his right hand from his trouser pocket,
holding a poker card flickering with a metallic gleam between his thumb
and index finger.

The card portrayed a grayish-white clown.

With a swift motion, Sow hurled the poker card at Camus's head.

In the men's washroom of the Matani Import and Export Shop.

Kolobo finally caught his reflection in the mirror.

His skin had turned a sickly green, and his hands were locked around his
own neck, the pressure making his bones crack. Twanaku Tupián stared
back at him from his bright blue eyes.

Kolobo tried to scream, but nothing came out. He wanted to run, but his
legs wouldn't move.

It was like his body wasn't his anymore---it was killing him.

*Ugh...* A choked sound finally escaped Kolobo's throat, too
quiet for anyone to hear.

Fear and despair tightened around his heart.

Then, Kolobo's fingers slipped.

A figure emerged from the shadows by the bathroom vents.

Lumian---black hair, green eyes, all dressed in black and white with a
golden straw hat.

A flicker of surprise crossed his face, then understanding. He held a
black bone flute to his lips.

A hum resounded, accompanied by a melancholic tune echoing from the dark
red holes.

Symphony of Hatred!

*Why did I only sense malice and danger now...* Just as this
thought crossed Twanaku's mind, Twanaku's murderous intent exploded,
fueled by the haunting melody.

Silently, a figure peeled away from Kolobo's body. It was Twanaku
Tupián, his light brown skin gone deathly pale.

Blood vessels bulged in his yellow eyes, threatening to burst.

The Symphony of Hatred tore into Kolobo, already weak with fear.

His heart almost stopped. He crumpled to the floor, barely alive.

Lumian stopped the melody. Holding the black bone flute, he slid back
into the shadows and under the vent.

A moment later, he reappeared behind Twanaku Tupián, who was practically
vibrating with murderous intent. Lumian lifted the flute, its
blood-colored holes gleaming ominously, and took a breath.

*Finally, you're here!*
