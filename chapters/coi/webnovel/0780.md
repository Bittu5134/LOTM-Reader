## Chapter 780: Primary Job

Lumian listened to the bartender recount the rivalries and grudges of
the Pirate Admirals while the pirates behind him grew increasingly
restless.

They were all hoping someone would make the first move, either by
shooting or stabbing the arrogant adventurer, so they could all rush him
at once.

But the threat of those crimson-white fireballs deterred them. They
looked at each other, but no one dared cross the chair Lumian had
designated.

They figured anyone this brazen had to be pretty strong, and the
Carnival Bar was low-tier, with no high-profile pirates around. They
could only hope those who had left would return with someone more
formidable.

After about ten minutes, one of the pirates who had left pushed open the
heavy wooden door.

Behind him was a middle-aged man wearing a tricorne hat and dressed in
dark blue.

The pirates in the bar immediately straightened up, holding their
breath. The noisy, lively atmosphere quickly returned to silence.

Some of them recognized the man, knowing him as Captain Flying Hadmagk
of the Rosemary, a well-known pirate just below the Pirate Admirals,
active on the Five Seas for over a decade.

The pirate who opened the door flashed a flattering smile and pointed at
Lumian's back. "Captain, that's the adventurer I mentioned! He dared to
provoke all the pirates in Banamo Port!"

Hadmagk, with his thick, dark hair and imposing presence, stared at
Lumian's back for a few seconds. He paused before asking, "How long has
he been maintaining those fireballs?"

"I don't know. They were there when I left the bar, but he might not
have kept them up the whole time," the pirate replied. He grabbed a
young pirate sitting by the door, pointing at Lumian and growling, "How
long has he been keeping those fireballs up?"

The young pirate, a bit flustered, glanced at the old clock on the wall
and stammered, "Almost... almost fifteen minutes."

*Fifteen minutes?* Flying Hadmagk's eyelid twitched, and he
suddenly looked like he remembered something important.

He immediately cursed at his sailor, "Did you forget about our important
deal at the docks? Bastard, is your brain filled with nothing but booze,
women, and pride?"

Cursing, Flying Haddock turned and walked out of the Carnival Bar.

His sailor, though dumbfounded, instinctively followed him.

*The captain is always right!*

The Carnival Bar remained quiet as Lumian finished his Lanti Proof and
stood up.

With those crimson-white fireballs still floating around him, he swept
his gaze over the pirates once more.

Then he smiled, raised his right hand, brought his index and middle
fingers to his lips, and blew softly.

It was like he was blowing away the smoke from a gun after shooting
everyone in the bar.

As the pirates' eyes and expressions shifted, Lumian leisurely walked
towards the door with his hands in his pockets.

One by one, the pirates instinctively moved out of his way.

Some felt aggrieved, some ground their teeth, and others consoled
themselves with thoughts like, It's not fear; those fireballs are just
too blinding!

Lumian seemed utterly unafraid of being ambushed as he walked out of the
Carnival Bar, almost like he was receiving their admiration and welcome.

Late at night, in an inconspicuous hotel room in Banamo Port.

Leaning back in his chair, Lumian said to Franca, "Disguise yourself and
spread the word that an unknown adventurer has been provoking all the
pirates, claiming they're cowards with no real strength, and that he
could crush any pirate's head under his boot."

Franca's mouth twitched slightly. "Fishing again? You're quite the
expert at this..."

Lumian chuckled in response. "According to the information we've
gathered, Admiral Deep Sea prefers to stay out of the public eye because
of his sea monster bloodline. Even if he comes to Banamo Port, he'll
likely stay on his flagship, the Newins. If he wants women or food,
someone will bring it to him.

"In this situation, we'll have to risk sneaking onto the Newins. It's an
alchemical ship from some ancient ruins, and we have no idea what traps
or mechanisms it might have. Plus, there are bound to be many Beyonder
pirates on board. As a Hunter, we should avoid fighting on someone
else's turf.

"I deliberately provoked the pirates in Banamo Port because I know no
Pirate Admirals are here right now. I have enough confidence to handle
the other notable pirates. They should soon figure this out too.
Expecting pirate crews to work together against me overestimates their
trust in each other. Who would they rather rob?

"I don't expect the pirates to have collective pride, but they
definitely want to show off their abilities and earn more fear and
respect. The pirates in Banamo Port are waiting for a pirate strong
enough to deal with me. At that point, when the Newins arrives and
Admiral Deep Sea is here, what do you think will happen?"

Jenna suddenly understood.

"If Admiral Deep Sea leaves the Newins and takes action himself, that
would be the best outcome. We would be fighting on our terms. Even if he
isn't interested, his top men won't miss the chance. With Admiral Deep
Sea as their backup, they won't fear failure and will be more willing to
challenge you. This will reduce the number of Beyonders on the Newins,
giving us our chance."

"Good psychological analysis," Lumian teased.

Jenna shot him a look.

"A good actor needs to understand people's minds."

"And then perform for the 'spectators'?" Lumian joked.

Anthony didn't react.

Franca scoffed. "What if a Pirate King's fleet arrives before the
Newins?"

Lumian spread his hands and said, "That's why the adventurer is
'unknown.' The benefit is that he can disappear without a trace. Change
his face and appearance, and we can execute another plan."

"A Conspirer is really an outright schemer..." Franca muttered.
"Alright, let's do it."

Lumian then discussed the possibility of using a large-scale plague in
Banamo Port, emphasizing the need to secretly distribute preventive
medicine to the locals beforehand.

Franca was stunned.

After a few seconds, she said, "You even thought of that... How about we
start a plague company? Just kidding, there's some plausibility in this,
but in this day and age, there are no vaccines---uh, preventive
medicine?"

"Normally, we wouldn't have it, but we can turn to mysticism," Lumian
replied. "The Apothecary path specializes in this. We just need to
provide them with a number of infected individuals for observation,
research, and experimentation. They should be able to create effective
preventive or curative medicine. We won't have trouble finding an
Apothecary. The Fool Pharmaceutical Company has plenty of them."

Lumian knew from Miss Magician that The Fool Pharmaceutical Company had
many ties to the Tarot Club.

Jenna began to calculate.

"A medicine with mystical effects would cost at least 100 verl d'or per
bottle. There are probably over ten thousand non-pirate residents in
Banamo Port. We'd need to prepare at least a million verl d'or. We can't
expect the Apothecaries from The Fool Pharmaceutical Company to work for
free or cover the material costs."

One million verl d'or wasn't a small sum. Even a Sequence 5 Beyonder
characteristic only cost around 200,000 verl d'or.

"A million verl d'or to become a demigod is a good deal," Lumian
suddenly laughed. "A million verl d'or is just an Admiral Deep Sea. Even
if we can't kill him, his top men are valuable too."

Franca sighed and replied, "You're starting to sound a bit like Gehrman
Sparrow. But while Gehrman Sparrow treated pirates as his piggy bank,
only targeting high-bounty ones, you're aiming to eradicate them
completely!"

A plague like that would likely affect thousands, if not tens of
thousands, of pirates.

Before Lumian could respond, Franca self-mockingly laughed.

"Poor Admiral Deep Sea. Just sitting on his flagship, doing nothing, and
suddenly he's our target."

Lumian chuckled, and said with some realization, "Nothing to pity. A
Hunter's job is to create chaos and strife. And your primary job as a
Demoness is to bring catastrophe and affliction. It's better to inflict
these on pirates than innocent people."

Franca and Jenna fell silent for a moment.

*Achoo!*

Banamo Port, Mason, sitting at the docks with a bottle of rye beer,
suddenly sneezed.

He immediately thought of the messenger summoning ritual he had
completed that afternoon and the unsettling messenger it had summoned,
muttering to himself, "Could that sneeze be some kind of spirituality
warning?

"Am I really going to be the protagonist of some occult event, the fool
who makes a mistake and attracts an evil god or devil?

"Did the ritual I performed bring some kind of catastrophe to Banamo
Port?

"Have hidden dangers and problems started quietly spreading in the
shadows?"

Gulping down a large swig of beer, Mason tried to reassure himself that
he was just scaring himself.

From afternoon until now, there had been no signs of calamity or reports
of strange phenomena!

It was just a messenger summoning. It should be fine!
