## Chapter 1035: Revelation

*Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.*

As Lumian walked down the stairs, the sunlight was still bright, and
Franca, Jenna, and Anthony were leisurely enjoying their afternoon tea.

Ludwig was also there, though not as relaxed.

"Is the Major Arcana meeting over?" Franca turned and asked curiously.

Lumian suddenly recalled various scenes from the majestic palace above
the gray fog, nodded and said, "It's over."

"What can you tell us about it? Don't mention anything you're not
supposed to." Franca had an expression that implied that she just wanted
to broaden her horizons.

Lumian sat down in an armchair and said, using language he had learned
in the dream city,

"There's not much to say. Today's meeting was quite ordinary. The Major
Arcana cards mainly reported to Mr. Fool about their respective
responsibilities, and Mr. Fool gave corresponding instructions."

"You seem to respect Mr. Fool quite a bit," Franca suddenly remarked.

"Why do you say that?" Lumian asked, somewhat surprised.

Franca snorted and glanced first at Jenna, then at Anthony. "Do I really
need to answer such a simple question?"

Jenna, in sync with Franca, helped explain with a slight smile, "If it
weren't for Mr. Fool, you would definitely add more adjectives before
'instructions,' like 'high-level' or 'all-encompassing.'"

This added a hint of teasing and playfulness.

"I've always been quite respectful towards deities, except for a few,"
Lumian said with a knowing smile.

He then said, "As someone attending a divine meeting for the first time,
I had nothing to report. I only raised questions about Madame Pualis and
her daughter Omebella, hoping to get answers from Mr. Fool."

"What did Mr. Fool say?" Jenna and Franca asked in unison.

Before Lumian could answer, points of starlight suddenly appeared in the
void.

These starlight quickly sketched out the figure of Madam Magician.

She said to Lumian, Franca, and Jenna, "You can now go to the Blue
Avenger to explore the treasury left by the Blood Emperor. I'll go with
you to provide necessary assistance.

"Do you need to postpone for a while to make some preparations?"

The Tudor dynasty's treasure obviously consisted of items mainly related
to the Hunter pathway, supplemented by those of the Demoness pathway,
and then some items from the Seer, Apprentice, and Marauder pathways. It
was very suitable for the three Demonesses to explore and obtain the
Beyonder characteristics needed for normal advancement or pathway
switching.

As for Anthony's advancement, other arrangements had been made.

And the further recovery of Ludwig's strength would have to wait until
either Lumian or Franca reached Sequence 3, to avoid accidents.

"No need, let's go now." Lumian had already discussed this with Franca
and Jenna.

Madam Magician said no more, creating a dazzling, dream-like double door
and bringing the three Demonesses to the Blue Avenger, which was sailing
through fierce winds and huge waves.

Mr. Hanged Man, dressed as the captain, was already waiting at the cabin
entrance.

"Can you still sense the mirror imprint you left in the treasury?" Madam
Magician asked Lumian.

"Yes," Lumian half-closed his eyes and sensed for a moment.

He didn't try to reach the full-length mirror with the imprint using
Mirror Traversal, because the corresponding area behind the mirror or
mirror world contained Blood Emperor Alista Tudor's backup plan for
resurrection.

For him, the main function of that mirror imprint was currently to
provide necessary positioning so that his companions could also enter
the treasury. In the future, it would serve as a trap marker to take
down powerful enemies at the cost of mutual destruction.

After sensing, Lumian walked towards the depths of the ship's cabin
while deliberately continuing the previous topic.

He turned his head to look at Franca and Jenna and said, "Mr. Fool's
revelation was that after becoming a Demoness of Unaging, go to the New
City of Silver to borrow the Gift of the Land and bring it to the City
of Exiles, in front of Hand Bro."

"Indeed, one knows Omebella, one shouted out Zedus. Let them meet, maybe
they'll really spark something." Franca suddenly realized.

At this moment, Mr. Hanged Man, walking in front as the captain of the
Blue Avenger, suddenly half-turned his body and said thoughtfully, "I
think in Mr. Fool's revelation, not only is the latter part important,
but the prerequisite is equally important."

Lumian mentioned Mr. Fool's revelation in front of Madam Magician and
Mr. Hanged Man precisely to hear their views and opinions. He
immediately asked,

"The prerequisite of becoming a Demoness of Unaging?"

Mr. Hanged Man, with his rugged face and unkempt appearance, chuckled
deeply. "Can't you borrow the Gift of the Land and bring it to the
Abscessed Hand now? The only help you might need is communication with
the Church of Knowledge."

"That's right," Jenna agreed with Mr. Hanged Man's statement.

Lumian already had all the conditions to briefly use the Gift of the
Land, could get the New City of Silver's permission through Mr. Sun, and
was the proxy of 0-01. He didn't need to wait until reaching the
Demoness of Unaging level to let Omebella's remains meet the Abscessed
Hand.

"Are certain changes brought by becoming a Demoness of Unaging the
catalyst for this whole thing? Or is it that only by reaching Sequence 3
can one deal with the inevitable accidents after the Gift of the Land
meets the Abscessed Hand? No, the latter scenario can basically be ruled
out," Lumian, in his Demoness of Despair state, slowed his pace and said
thoughtfully.

As the proxy of 0-01, he had considerable authority in front of the
mountain of corpses, and there wasn't much difference between being
Sequence 4 or Sequence 3.

Moreover, he could briefly borrow the boon beneath the Underworld
Daoist's seal to become a Sequence 3 War Bishop.

In other words, the power increase from advancing to Demoness of Unaging
wasn't necessary.

"It should be some change brought about by the inherent qualities of the
Demoness of Unaging," Madam Magician gave her judgment.

Franca, who had been listening quietly, mumbled, "Why doesn't Mr. Fool
speak more clearly, just giving revelations for us to interpret
ourselves?"

Mr. Hanged Man glanced at Franca. "I learned a phrase in the dream
city---'words, once given, become reality'.

"Every action and word of great existences profoundly influences fate
and the world. Back then, in the process of Mr. Fool becoming a great
existence in just three years, many of the things he said were later
verified one by one, becoming facts.

"In this situation, speaking very clearly and not speaking clearly will
be part of the whole thing, and the interference with fate will be
different, and the final result will also deviate because of this."

As Lumian nodded in agreement, he felt slightly surprised inwardly.

He felt that Mr. Hanged Man was much more enthusiastic than in their
previous encounters.

Previously, Mr. Hanged Man wouldn't be stingy with his judgments and
explanations, but he only did and said what was within his duties. This
time, he actually took the initiative to talk about many things outside
the topic.

*Is it because I've become a Major Arcana card holder? Mr. Hanged Man
seems to value hierarchy quite a bit...* Lumian withdrew his
gaze thoughtfully.

Madam Magician then added, "Moreover, this matter involves the Great
Mother. Even Mr. Fool can't see it very clearly and can only receive
certain revelations."

Hearing this, Franca looked around and lowered her voice.

"Now that Mr. Fool has initially awakened, uh, I don't mean to
disrespect Mr. Fool, I'm just more concerned about his current state.
Maybe there's still something I can help with? After all, I'm a
transmigrator! Um, what I want to ask is, what level has Mr. Fool
recovered to now, and how is The Fool identity you guys have woven
running?"

After exchanging glances with Madam Magician and Mr. Hanged Man, Lumian
said, "We're not clear about the specific level of recovery, we can only
be sure that in terms of level, it's not a complete The Fool."

This "Fool" without the "Mr." referred to the Sequence 0 The Fool of the
Seer pathway.

The basis for the judgment of the Major Arcana card holders, including
Lumian, was: if the identity of Gehrman Sparrow was already a complete
"Fool", it would mean that he had fully grasped all the authorities of
the Seer pathway, and the true Mr. Fool would soon gain sufficient
advantage in the matter of fusion and confrontation, fully awakening.

Lumian continued, "In my personal opinion, the current Mr. Fool is not
agile enough, or rather, he's colder and more indifferent, closer to
Gehrman Sparrow."

After thinking for a while, Franca said, "I think, in my personal
understanding, Gehrman Sparrow is currently more like an AI---artificial
intelligence---that has integrated some of Mr. Fool's will and ideas.

"Think about it, one of the foundations of Gehrman Sparrow's stable
existence is a large number of faith anchors, and different people's
perceptions of him are different. This is like one of the foundations of
AI's existence is data---a large amount of data---and the data collected
from the internet, fed to AI, may be incorrect, fabricated,
self-imagined. This will bring corruption to it, very similar to the
corruption of faith anchors you mentioned.

"The current AI stands out in that as long as you dare to believe, it
dares to fabricate, and the reactions presented by Gehrman Sparrow will
also be affected by the corruption of faith anchors. While not affecting
the transmission of Mr. Fool's core will and ideas, there will be
personalized, even contradictory manifestations.

"Well, he's equivalent to Mr. Fool's AI assistant. The better he
iterates, the faster he evolves, the more authorities and powers Mr.
Fool can grasp and mobilize, ultimately helping him defeat the Celestial
Worthy."

Interpreting from the perspective of AI was something the Major Arcana
card holders had never thought of. Fortunately, everyone present had
been to the dream city and could barely understand what Franca was
saying.

Madam Magician, who had a very deep understanding of faith anchors,
nodded slowly and said, "What we need to do next is to purify Gehrman
Sparrow's anchors and adjust people's perceptions of Gehrman Sparrow to
varying degrees?"

"That includes our perception of Gehrman Sparrow," Mr. Hanged Man added.

As they spoke, the group arrived at the stairs leading to the lower deck
of the ship.
