## Chapter 1141: Divine Kingdom

The sky of the special mirror world was split in two: one half dyed
crimson, the other divided by a chaotic vortex and formless, colorless
flames. The three forces clashed violently.

Suddenly, all light vanished, as if something was voraciously absorbing
everything around it.

Franca and the others in the World of Ruins had just recovered from
their ailments and stabilized their genders. Then, they watched as the
burning flames above, meteors streaking across the sky, and mountains
spewing smoke and magma all disappeared from view.

They were plunged into darkness---a darkness so profound that nothing
seemed capable of existing within it.

After what felt like an eternity, the darkness receded. Crimson
moonlight once again illuminated the Northern and Southern Continents
and the five oceans. Bright stars of various hues returned to their
natural states.

The World of Ruins was restored to its former appearance.

In the special mirror world, Lumian's eyes no longer reflected the
crimson full moon. Everything seemed normal.

He let out a chuckle and lowered his four newly grown arms.

Then, he grasped a handful of flames, compressing them into a metallic
mirror.

Lumian gazed into the mirror and saw two figures standing back to
back---one was Aurore, and the other Jenna. Both had become even more
beautiful, their eyes now open. However, their gazes were vacant and
hollow, devoid of spirituality. They remained under Lumian's conscious
control.

Lumian stared at them blankly for a few seconds. A smile gradually
curved his lips, and the Aurore and Jenna in the mirror returned his
smile.

Behind them was another indistinct figure---Cheek.

On Lumian's left shoulder, the face of Cheek also smiled sweetly and
seemed about to speak.

Suddenly, Lumian summoned the dark-gold, peculiar mask and forcefully
pressed it onto the slowly spinning chaotic vortex face.

Starlight descended, illuminating the entire mask.

Cheek's mouth opened, but no words came out. Her reflection in the
mirror disappeared along with the attempt.

Her face on Lumian's shoulder showed clear dissatisfaction.

Lumian cast his gaze around and found that the Traveler's Bag he had
exchanged with Franca was completely shattered in the previous
destruction. Only two items remained intact on the ground: the dark-gold
peculiar mask he had just used and the Demoness card---Lumian didn't
keep any items in this Traveler's Bag because only the puppet soldier
puppets, mask, and Card of Blasphemy could be of use in the previous
battle.

Lumian summoned the Demoness card to his hand and discovered that the
previously obscured advancement ritual for becoming a god in the
Demoness pathway was now revealed: "Descend into the depths of the
earth, find the Chaos Sea, endure a degree of its corruption while
maintaining oneself---neither falling nor transforming."

*Quite considerate. The mention of the sefirah must have been "hidden"
in advance. Who would have thought that the advancement ritual for the
Demoness pathway would involve another sefirah entirely...*
Lumian mused, suddenly suspecting there was something off about this
ritual.

The first Blasphemy Slate was formed from the corpse of the Primordial
God Almighty. Perhaps before dying, He altered the corresponding
knowledge to make the Demoness advancement ritual involve contact with
the Chaos Sea. This would facilitate His unique revival through the
pathways of calamity and allow Him to control and utilize the Chaos Sea
effectively post-resurrection.

As for the second Blasphemy Slate, though it was created from the
Ancient Sun God's corpse, who could say it wasn't influenced by the
Primordial God Almighty?

*Still, it makes sense for a Demoness, who governs chaos, to need prior
contact with the Chaos Sea...* Lumian shook his head, dismissing
the truth of the matter as irrelevant.

To him, this ritual was unnecessary to perform yet essentially already
fulfilled.

The face sealed by the dark-gold peculiar mask came from the Primordial
God Almighty, bearing a deep, special connection to the Chaos Sea. Its
power surpassed mere corruption from the Chaos Sea.

"So, you went mad during your advancement ritual?" Lumian tilted his
head, mocking the Cheek face.

Cheek's face widened Her eyes, as if to say: "When did I ever go mad? My
mental state has always been impeccable."

At this moment, the special mirror world fully stabilized, reflecting
shades of gray and white, formless and colorless flames, an ambiguous
and enchanting atmosphere, and a chaotic vortex encompassing all
possibilities.

It was evolving into Lumian's divine kingdom.

For the Red Priest, a divine kingdom emerged from a deeper
conceptualization of the authority of Conquest. By completely
"conquering" a land, battlefield, or special area, it could be
transformed into the Red Priest's divine kingdom. Any living being
entering the kingdom, without corresponding protection or sufficient
rank, would immediately become a soldier of the Red Priest.

For the Demoness, the divine kingdom was closely tied to the mirror
world. The Primordial Demoness had previously established Her divine
kingdom in a hidden corner of the mirror world. There, only females
could exist---even other true gods would acquire distinct female
characteristics upon entry. There, gazing upon what should not be seen
would immediately turn one into stone. There, without protection, one
would frequently encounter disasters tied to oneself. There, extreme
pleasure would sporadically manifest, making one reluctant to leave...

Lumian could now "conquer" the special mirror world, transforming it
into a divine kingdom that satisfied the needs of both the Red Priest
and Chaos Demoness.

Lumian surveyed his surroundings and allowed the scenes reflected in the
special mirror world to change. They became Cordu Village, surrounded by
blue skies, white clouds, and lush green grasslands. At the village's
edge stood the Rue Anarchie, with Aurore's house built beside Auberge du
Coq Doré...

After gazing at it for a moment, Lumian let the scene gradually fade
away.

He smiled faintly and entered the astral world composed of concepts and
symbols before returning to reality.

His three-headed, six-armed form nodded toward Franca and Madam
Magician, who were looking at him, and said, "Thank you all. The
operation is successfully concluded.

"Let's head back to the protected zone."

"Alright," Mr. Sun and the others responded one after another.

Trier, inside the luxurious villa.

Franca studied the clean, refreshed faces of Aurore and Jenna with
undisguised anticipation.

"It really seems like revival is possible if we take it a step further,"
she said.

Hearing this, Anthony cast a subtle glance at Franca.

Lumian nodded lightly, smiling self-deprecatingly.

"Sometimes, it feels meaningless. Other times, I can't help but hope and
yearn for it."

"Hope is good. Hope is very good," Franca replied, smiling at Lumian.
"I'm now a Demoness of Catastrophe, an Angel. Surely I can know certain
things now?"

Lumian couldn't help but chuckle. "Do you have to be so impatient?
Stabilize yourself first.

"Anyway, I need to report to Mr. Fool about this. It's related to future
actions. When I return, I'll explain briefly."

"Alright." Franca didn't hide her anticipation and felt that Lumian
seemed in a much better state, having exacted revenge by defeating
Primordial Demoness Cheek.

Once Lumian ascended to his room to prepare for entering the gray fog,
Franca turned to Anthony and asked curiously, "Why did you give me the
look earlier?"

It couldn't be because my allure, still somewhat uncontrollable after
becoming a Demoness of Catastrophe, affected him, right?

When it came to beauty and charm, Lumian's Cheek face clearly surpassed
hers!

Anthony smiled slightly and said, "I was just reflecting on how your
mental state is much better than I imagined and how your resilience
exceeds my expectations."

Franca froze for a moment, then sighed softly after a few seconds. "I
have to force myself to stay calm and optimistic.

"He can be gloomy, he can lose control in madness, but I can't. Although
I sometimes fall into gloom, most of the time, I must remain cheerful
and optimistic. Otherwise, there's truly no hope..."

"That's your humanity," Anthony remarked emotionally. "I'm glad Lumian
and Jenna met you, and I'm glad to have you as a teammate."

Franca let out a somewhat smug laugh, then warily asked, "Why do I feel
like you're trying to give me therapy?"

"I've never hidden that," Anthony replied with a smile as he turned
toward the kitchen area. "It's free, after all."

Above the gray fog, within the majestic palace.

After recounting the highlights of the battle and the Primordial
Demoness's performance, Lumian said, "This time, I've initiated the
convergence. With the awareness and spirit of both Cheek and Tudor
present, I don't need much time to adapt before mastering the
authorities of the Demoness and Red Priest pathways. If things are
critical with the Mother Goddess of Depravity, I can conduct a deep
secret deed and astral travel to the City of Calamity now.

"But if there's no immediate urgency, I'd prefer about a month to
stabilize myself and strengthen the newly formed balance."

Shrouded in gray fog, Mr. Fool nodded and spoke with a faintly ethereal
tone, "There is at least one month."

Before Lumian could respond, his voice softened.

"Your three-headed, six-armed form stems from a fundamental
transformation. Even I cannot restore you to a normal appearance, only
conceal it with illusions. However, once you stabilize your balance and
the apocalypse passes, I can use Wish and Fooling to grant you a second
form.

"This form will allow you to switch freely, turning your spatial
three-heads-six-arms into a temporal one. Your three heads and
corresponding bodies will each occupy different time segments of the
day, living their own lives but still under your main consciousness's
control.

"The biggest drawback of this form is that you, Aurore, and Jenna will
never be able to appear together or meet each other..."

Hearing Mr. Fool's unhurried words about post-apocalypse possibilities,
Lumian suddenly felt a fleeting daze---as if the apocalypse could indeed
end and he might truly survive.

Lumian didn't say anything pessimistic. He simply listened quietly.

Gradually, he understood that Mr. Fool wasn't making a promise or
offering comfort but expressing his own hope, giving heartfelt
blessings.

He genuinely wished for the apocalypse to end, for Lumian to survive,
and for him to live a better life.

"...At that point, your rank will no longer suit being a Major Arcana
card holder of the Tarot Club. This isn't the Rose Redemption after all.
But you can have Franca take your place as a Major Arcana card holder.
Just draw a new card. Every Major Arcana card holder in the Tarot Club
already has dual identities, many representing other factions..." By the
end, Mr. Fool's voice carried a hint of amusement.

At some unknown moment, Lumian found himself at peace. He chuckled along
and said, "Alright, Mr. Fool."

Mr. Fool gently nodded and replied, "Then I shall convene an impromptu
gathering now."
