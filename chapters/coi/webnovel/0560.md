## Chapter 560: Traces

Lato rarely divulged details about the sea prayer ritual. He spoke with
a weighty demeanor, "Yes, the Governor of the Sea ties the knot with the
sea, quelling its violence and bringing peace. They truly become the
spouse of the sea, commanding authority over this stretch of water.

"As the assistant and deputy hosts, we also gain varying degrees of
superpowers from the sea's satisfaction and joy. Those with the sea
bloodline in Port Santa receive some boons, although they are limited in
number."

*So, the Governor of the Sea is synonymous with Husband of the Sea. The
assistant and deputy hosts are like close friends or family busy
assisting at a wedding, naturally earning gratitude. Those with the sea
bloodline are akin to children attending a wedding, typically gaining
some candy...* Lumian attempted to comprehend Lato Guiaro's
description of the sea prayer ritual by combining reality and wedding
traditions in novels.

Intrigued, he inquired, "Does the Governor of the Sea engage in those
acts with the sea?"

Aren't weddings supposed to conclude with newlyweds consummating their
marriage?

"Of course!" Lato affirmed, "After the wedding, the sea will bind itself
to the four Maidens of the Sea. Through their union with the Governor of
the Sea, the first child of each Maiden of the Sea is a noble with a
pure sea bloodline, possessing the strongest Beyonder powers.

"Why four and not one Maiden of the Sea? It's because individual humans
can't endure the vastness, expansiveness, weight, and transcendence of
the sea. Enough partners are needed to share the burden."

*The more I listen, the more ominous it becomes... Marrying a Maiden of
the Sea is akin to marrying a remnant of the sea's power. It's no wonder
they're highly valued, and their destinies change. The only challenge is
acknowledging and loving their wife's first child.* Lumian
contemplated for a moment and remarked, "And the Governor of the Sea can
withstand the passion of the sea?"

And it was four at a time.

Lato, devoid of pity or sympathy, stated, "One of the two most crucial
purposes of the vigil ritual is to utilize the house and some of the sea
spawn concealed within it to transform the Governor of the Sea's body,
enabling them to withstand the violent and unrestrained sea.

"That's why the Governor of the Sea can only serve for a year. Even with
the physical transformation, the power acquisition, and the Beyonder
enhancement, they won't endure much longer."

*Consumable. The husband of the sea is a consumable...* Lumian
sighed inwardly and queried, "Then why would the Governor of the Sea
return to the sea after leaving office?"

"No one knows the exact reason, but there's a certain conjecture. Juan
Oro believes that the sea doesn't allow those who were once its husband
to start a new life. And I believe that the modifications of the vigil
ritual, the intrusion of spousal intercourse, and the influence of
maritime authority make the Governor of the Sea more and more like a sea
creature and less human. Eventually, he will inevitably return to the
sea that gives him peace and comfort." Lato felt that his deduction was
correct.

What exactly is the sea you're referring to? Is it a natural spirit or a
creature beyond, controlling the sea? Lumian replayed Lato Guiaro's
answers in his mind before asking, "Sea spawn? Like the wrinkled
monsters that can disguise themselves as devils, and the long black
insects that control humans by burrowing into their necks?"

"Yes," Lato responded, yearning for a cigarette but unable to move his
hands. "We, the Children of the Sea, are spawn of the sea. One of our
duties is guiding certain sea spawn from the depths to settle on land
using our Beyonder powers, helping them reproduce."

*However, Ludwig mentioned that the Batings Black Insects originate from
another planet, not some sea spawn...* Lumian didn't rush to ask
about the Children of the Sea's Beyonder powers; instead, he focused on
the details of the sea prayer ritual.

"What's the other vital purpose of the vigil?"

Lato's expression hinted: "Don't you understand what weddings are
about?"

"Well, there's the exchange of rings for marriage. And the vigil ritual
modifies the Governor of the Sea's body, attaching a unique trait to a
fixed golden ring, matching it to the sea bride's identity."

*A unique golden ring...* Lumian perked up and said, "And then?"

During last year's April Fool's prank, fringe members received orders to
acquire a gold ring from Torres and conceal it within the lamb
sacrifice's stomach!

"Then, following the completion of the other rituals, the Governor of
the Sea will take the golden ring and cast it directly into the sea
before the ship. He will utter in a unique language from the depths, 'I
espouse thee, O sea, as a sign of true and perpetual dominion!'

"If the sea consents to this union, gentle waves will stir, transforming
into pure white foam petals that will shower over the four Maidens of
the Sea.

"The returned ring carries symbolic weight, signifying authority over
the waters surrounding Port Santa."

*Just the waters encompassing Port Santa? From the indications, it seems
it's not the true sea, but rather something that affects this specific
area of the waters...* Lumian paused briefly before speaking,
"How do you express 'I espouse thee, O sea...' in that peculiar
language?"

Lato Guiaro contemplated for a moment before emitting a chattering
sound.

Under the influence of the Language Comprehension charms, Lumian failed
to grasp its meaning. He concluded it wasn't part of the Northern
Continent's languages.

Simultaneously, he observed the Knight of Swords in Lato's eyes slightly
shaking his head.

*If the Knight of Swords truly belongs to the temperance faction that
parted ways from the Rose School of Thought to align with the Church of
The Fool, he should possess knowledge of the Southern Continent's
language. Additionally, with his high Sequence and extensive tenure as a
Beyonder, he must have encountered most supernatural tongues. Does this
imply it's not from the language family of the Southern Continent, let
alone ancient Hermes, Dragonese, Elvish, or other mystical
languages?* Lumian regarded Lato Guiaro with an intrigued grin.

"Are you certain those words translate to 'I espouse thee, O sea...'?"

Lato hesitated briefly before explaining, "Probably. This is a language
passed down from ancient times, existing since the sea prayer ritual.
There are only a few sentences..."

*He's not sure... They hadn't systematically mastered the language, only
capable of uttering two or three sentences based on the
legacy...* Lumian sensed there might be more to it than Lato's
description; there was no denial if the true meaning was akin to "Open
Sesame."

The folks from the Fisheries Guild and Milo Village might have been akin
to the individuals Aurore and Franca spoke of. They employed a peculiar
language, its true meaning eluding them as they substituted it with
their own interpretation.

As Lumian pondered, his expression remained unchanged.

"Does the Governor of the Sea safeguard the ring after he acquires the
special trait?"

"No," Lato responded, shaking his head. "In addition to the Governor of
the Sea, the Maidens of the Sea, and sailors in charge of controlling
the ship, there are four pure-blooded Children of the Sea acting as
deputy hosts. They guide the Governor and the Maidens through the ritual
stages, teaching the unique call to marriage. The golden ring is held by
one of the deputy hosts and only handed over to the Governor when
needed."

*The Governor of the Sea doesn't have a chance to switch ritual
rings...* Suppressing his anxiety, Lumian continued at a
measured pace, "Did the sea prayer ritual fail last year?"

Lato initially seemed taken aback, but then relief crossed his face.

"Did the imposter seek your help?"

"Yes, for some reason, the sea prayer ritual failed. The sea's rage
claimed the lives of the Governor of the Sea and the four Children of
the Sea serving as deputy hosts. Only the Maidens of the Sea and some
sailors survived."

*The four deputy hosts are dead?* Just as Lumian uncovered clues
about April Fool's, he sensed the link had been abruptly severed.

The individuals with the best chance of substituting the ceremonial ring
had all perished in the unsuccessful sea prayer ritual!

Lumian thought for a moment before inquiring, "What happened to the
surviving Maidens of the Sea and sailors?"

"They're still alive, but under strict surveillance." Realizing that the
failure to last year's sea prayer ritual was exposed, Lato, not dwelling
on the survivors' details, continued, "We arranged marriages for the
four Maidens of the Sea who lack actual sea powers with ordinary family
members. Though it won't bring about a Beyonder-level change, it has its
benefits.

"The sailors, from Milo Village, received some benefits from Juan Oro
but are restricted from leaving Milo Village until this year's sea
prayer ritual succeeds."

Shifting gears, Lumian asked, "Did the sailors transport the sacrificial
lambs and other offerings for the marriage to the sea to the deck?"

"Yes." Lato nodded. "Sailors handle such cumbersome and laborious
tasks."

*Within the ranks of sailors, one among Bard, Mad Lady, or Ultraman had
sneaked in. If the other side held a stronger Beyonder power or a
mystical item from the Marauder pathway, they could snatch the genuine
ceremonial ring during the exchange, swapping it with a counterfeit...
It wouldn't be a surprise that the Marauder pathway, influenced by the
Celestial Worthy, has key April Fool's members wielding matching
strengths or artifacts...* Lumian swiftly suspected this.

He turned to Lato Guiaro, keeping his tone composed.

"Tell me about the four Maidens of the Sea and the survivors from last
year among the sailors."

Lato recounted the details from memory.

Having absorbed the specifics about the potential targets, Lumian
inquired further, "Were all participants in the sea sacrificial part
thoroughly checked?"

"Absolutely. No unauthorized items allowed onboard to maintain the
ritual's integrity. And before the ship reaches its destination, Juan
Oro will vigilantly oversee using his powers," Lato elaborated.

As anticipated, Lumian nodded subtly.

"What powers does Juan Oro wield?"
