## Chapter 514: Huge Wave

Lumian took a moment to consider. He didn't think there was any real
danger.

Philip's concern was based on Bone Splitter Basil's reaction, which only
hinted at a potential problem on the ship. While Philip knew which
passengers and crew members were suspicious, he couldn't pinpoint the
real source of the trouble. He wasn't even sure if he was right, and
wouldn't dare to be certain. Therefore, his suspect might not be the
actual issue.

In other words, it was more likely that the real problem was actually
sitting right beside him: Lumian and his new godson, Ludwig. However,
Philip wasn't aware of this, and by excluding them, would mistakenly
focus on other suspects.

*Apart from Ludwig and me, whether there are other serious problems or
not, Philip is right, *Lumian thought, letting out a soft sigh.*
Before any major troubles surface, it's best not to investigate or
provoke them. We'll pretend not to see, hear, or speak, and wait for
them to reach their destination and leave the Flying Bird...*

*Of course, this depends on the situation remaining stable. If any
abnormalities arise, we'd have to find a way to resolve them
immediately. Sometimes, pretending not to see things doesn't prevent
them from worsening. The Cordu catastrophe is a gruesome reminder of
that...* Lumian thought and sighed softly.

He turned around and extended his hand, briefly shaking Philip's with a
smile.

"I'm glad we reached an agreement."

Philip breathed a sigh of relief, retracted his right hand, and downed
his golden malt beer.

He had been worried that someone like Louis Berry, who used a fake
identity and was suspected of being a criminal, would be stubborn and
adventurous. He was concerned that Louis wouldn't listen to reason and
would insist on uncovering the "huge problem" that scared off the Black
Octopus.

Philip felt no sympathy for someone who might die because of their own
foolishness, but he didn't want them to endanger everyone else.

Thankfully, Louis Berry seemed like someone who could be reasoned with.

As Philip drained his beer, he kept assuring himself:

The Fog Sea Archipelago wasn't far from the Republic. In fact, its
proximity was why Intis had chosen it as its first overseas colony. The
Flying Bird wouldn't need to stop at other ports for supplies on its
journey, allowing it to arrive directly.

Assuming the weather remained calm, the Flying Bird should dock in
Farim, the capital of the Fog Sea Archipelago, by the following evening.
If they encountered bad weather, they might need to slow down, change
course, or seek refuge in another port. The latest they could arrive
would be noon the day after tomorrow.

Perhaps that troublesome problem would disembark in Port Farim?

Even if something was brewing beneath the surface, it wouldn't fully
erupt in just a day or two.

Endure, and it would be over!

Reassured, Philip---hugging his lover, Gozia---rose from his barstool
and left the bustling bar.

Lumian continued sipping his Lanti Proof, seemingly unfazed.

With a smile, he turned to the bartender, Francesco, and remarked, "I've
heard that many Feynapotterians are homesick. Even when they have to
leave for work, they often return home, write letters, or send
telegrams. You, however, chose to work overseas, on a ship that makes it
difficult to stay in touch with the outside world."

Francesco raised his hand and gestured. "While I love my family dearly,
families like ours, with generations living together, often face various
problems and conflicts. My grandmother, a wise woman, manages us well,
but it can be stifling for the younger generation. There are too many
elders eager to share their life experiences.

"Furthermore, my home is in Port Santa. The Flying Bird docks there
almost every month. So, for me, this job is both work and a trip home."

*It's just like the book that described Feynapotterian customs.
Feynapotterians enjoy living in large families spanning multiple
generations. And in such families, the most senior woman who has given
birth becomes the natural matriarch, controlling the entire family's
affairs, regardless of whether her husband is alive. In a religious
sense, such a woman is considered the embodiment of Earth Mother within
the family...* His chat with Bartender Francesco wasn't purely
for relaxation. He had two goals: Firstly, he wanted to understand the
passengers better through Francesco's eyes. His final destination was
Port Santa, which was five to six days away. Paying attention to the
various details of life on the Flying Bird was crucial. Secondly, he
wanted to verify the information in his books and gain a grasp of local
customs in the Feynapotter Kingdom. Missing out on important knowledge
could lead him to misinterpret situations in Port Santa.

The night passed peacefully, save for a child waking up twice to eat,
the rhythmic chewing noises hardly disturbing Lumian's sleep. The gentle
rocking of the ship and the waves outside his window created a lulling
atmosphere.

Just when he thought the Flying Bird would smoothly reach Port Farim,
the capital of the Fog Sea Archipelago, by evening, the weather took a
sudden turn.

The sea, previously veiled in a thin fog, began to seethe. Giant waves,
like towering mountains, rose and fell in rapid succession.

The Flying Bird bobbed precariously on the waves, its air of colossal
power replaced by vulnerability.

Now, it was a mere leaf tossed between the sky and the sea, a toy in the
hands of a giant. Tiny and fragile, it seemed ready to capsize at any
moment.

Oddly, the massive waves were not accompanied by darkness or torrential
rain. Instead, the howling wind dispersed the fog above, revealing a
clear azure sky.

A sailor scrambled down from the observation deck and, holding his
telescope to Philip, shouted, "Boss, this wave isn't right!

"Only our area has waves this big! Everywhere else is calm!

"There's no rain here either!"

Philip, holding onto Gozia who trembled pale from the force of the
elements, instinctively furrowed his brow.

*Abnormal waves?*

*Had that "major problem" caused them?*

No sooner had the thought crossed his mind than the Flying Bird was
flung into the air by a monstrous wave, only to be slammed onto another.

Terrifying jolts and tremors reverberated through the air, eliciting
screams of fear from many passengers.

They sensed the Flying Bird teetering on the brink of capsizing, a
shipwreck imminent.

In first-class cabin number 5, Lugano stared calmly out the window,
gripping the frame as the dining table slid across the room with the
force of the storm.

He knew that if the Flying Bird couldn't withstand the tempest, Lumian
Lee would undoubtedly "teleport" him and Ludwig to safety in Port Farim.

Lumian, gazing at the strangely calm azure sea beyond the monstrous
waves, sensed something amiss.

He wasted no time, retrieving the Mystery Prying Glasses from his
Traveler's Bag, hoping to uncover the hidden cause of this disaster.

As the brown, gold-rimmed glasses settled on the bridge of his nose, a
familiar dizziness washed over him. He saw a chaotic montage of scenes
around him unfold.

On deck, a tidal wave surged, tossing Philip. Clutching a rope in
desperation, he descended rapidly with Gozia. He instinctively
positioned himself below her, shielding his new lover from the fall. He
landed with a heavy thud, the rope burning a gash into his palm, drawing
blood.

Chaos reigned in the dining hall as plates, knives, and forks flew
through the air; customers were flung around.

In one room, a blurry figure of a woman sat by the window, sobbing
uncontrollably.

The boiler chamber was a scene of disarray, scattered coal littering the
floor. Beneath it crawled a horrifying horde of creatures resembling
seashells.

And beneath the deceptively calm azure surface, a peculiar fish gazed up
at the beleaguered Flying Bird!

Its size rivaled that of a shark, its grayish-black body devoid of
scales, replaced instead by numerous, pulsing meatballs. These strange
orbs shimmered with an interconnected, faint starlight, forming cryptic
symbols. It sported a pair of eyes on each side of its head, and its
gaping maw was as sharp as a flagpole.

Surrounding this strange fish and numerous similar fish seemed to form a
school.

With a sharp gasp, Lumian ripped off the Mystery Prying Glasses and
stuffed them back into his Traveler's Bag, his chest heaving.

He suspected the strange fish were behind the violent waves, though it
was unclear if the wind was a consequence of the upheaval or a separate
cause.

Knowing the strange fish were submerged, Lumian discarded the idea of
using a massive fireball to guide the Flying Bird's cannons towards
them.

Instead, he activated the black mark on his right shoulder and
teleported himself to the nearby patch of sea he had just witnessed.

As he did so, he retrieved the blackened bone flute adorned with
dark-red holes.

General Philip's Symphony of Hatred!

Lumian materialized mid-air and, while descending, brought the bone
flute to his lips.

He had learned the flute from shepherds during his time in Cordu, and
over the past few days, he had been diligently practicing and refining
his skills. Now, he began to play a melodious tune, one filled with a
longing for home.

It was a favorite melody among the wandering shepherds.

The muffled explosions of fireballs churned the water, slowing Lumian's
descent. But amidst his melody, a new tune, one that seemed to emanate
from the depths of destiny itself, pierced through the seawater and
reached the "ears" of the strange fish and their kind below.

Suddenly, the strange fish froze. A mountain-like wave descended, but no
new ones followed.

*Boom! Boom! Boom!* The smaller fish surrounding the strange
fish exploded from their heads, turning on their own kind in a frenzy.
Others simply died and floated to the surface.

Lumian's descent accelerated as his feet, legs, and body submerged into
the icy sea.

He continued playing the shepherds' longing melody, feeling the seawater
reach his neck and threatening to engulf his mouth.

The next moment, dark-red blood oozed from the four eyes and multiple
bumps on the shark-sized fish.

The terrifying waves subsided rapidly.

With only half his head above water, Lumian lowered the bone flute and
smiled. He activated Spirit World Traversal once more.

*Cough, cough, cough!* As he materialized back in Room 5 of the
first-class cabin, salty seawater spewed from his mouth.

In his eagerness to ensure the effectiveness of the music, he had
stopped playing too late, ending up swallowing a mouthful of seawater.
Additionally, fearing that too much commotion would disrupt the
"teleportation," he had held his breath until returning before choking.

*Is this a form of unluckiness?* Lumian mused.

Lugano, startled by Lumian's drenched state, asked, "Is it resolved?"

"Seems like it," Lumian replied with a smile.

His shoes and trouser legs bore the marks of wear and tear, scorched and
dripping seawater.

At that moment, cheers erupted across the Flying Bird as passengers and
crew noticed the receding waves.

"Praise the Sun!"

"By steam!"

"Thank you, Mother of All Things!"
