## Chapter 1089: Above the Sequences

Mr. Fool directed his gaze toward Madam Magician Fors.

She habitually cleared her throat and said to The Chariot Lumian, "You
must have already guessed that there's another level above Sequence 0,
right?"

"Those great existences?" Lumian asked without any surprise.

"Yes, the great existences above the Sequences." Madam Magician nodded.
"They have accommodated a sefirah and all corresponding Uniquenesses,
plus one Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristic from each corresponding
pathway. They are also known as Great Old Dominators and Outer Deities,
with indestructible psyches."

*Great Old Dominators... Outer Deities...* Lumian mulled over
these terms.

Madam Magician said with a smile, "This is how I understand it: all
current great existences above the Sequences are true deities as defined
by Mr. Fool. They are either personas split from the Original Creator,
His direct offspring, or the first beings born from the Great Mother.
They had essentially appeared in this universe before the Original
Creator awakened and completely self-destructed, Their status
originating from the old era.

"These are conditions that subsequent advancers can never achieve. Even
if they truly become great existences, they would only be newly born
Above the Sequences..."

As she spoke, Madam Magician felt like she was discussing Mr. Fool right
in front of him, and her voice gradually became quieter.

She paused before continuing, "Therefore, those great existences like to
call themselves Great Old Dominators, and some true gods refer to Them
as the Great Old Ones.

"And the currently living Great Old Dominators are all outside the
barrier. Some want to invade our world, thus they are also called Outer
Deities."

"I see... Uniquenesses correspond to Sequence 0 true gods, sefirot
correspond to those above the Sequences..." Lumian summarized in his own
way.

Madam Magician quickly glanced at Mr. Fool, and seeing no particular
reaction from this great existence, she continued, "Sefirot are
collections of symbols, sources of authority, and origins of power.

"Back then, when the Original Creator awakened, causing the destruction
of the old era, He split into six sefirot, sixteen Uniquenesses, and all
the Beyonder characteristics of sixteen paths of the divine."

*The destruction of the old era? Did Mr. Fool, Aurore, Franca, and other
transmigrators come from the old era that was destroyed when the
Original Creator awakened?* Lumian nodded imperceptibly.

Madam Magician Fors carefully said, "But currently, there are not just
six sefirot in our world, but nine."

*Nine?* Lumian asked in surprise, "Did they originally exist?"

Besides Sefirah Castle, Chaos Sea, City of Calamity, River of Eternal
Darkness, Knowledge Moor, and Key of Light, there were three more
sefirot?

Madam Magician shook her head. "No, they are extraterrestrial in nature.

"The awakening and self-destruction of the Original Creator was a
catastrophe for the entire universe. During this process, His three
direct offspring---the Mother Goddess of Depravity, um, that is, the
Great Mother, along with the Mother Tree of Desire and Son of
Chaos---were most affected. Their sefirot were each torn in half, with
one half being drawn to the site of the Original Creator's
self-destruction along with Their corresponding Uniquenesses and
Beyonder characteristics---that is, to our world, or rather, our planet.

"Since then, there have been nine sefirot, twenty-two Uniquenesses, and
twenty-two divine pathways within the barrier.

"Why specifically nine and twenty-two? Perhaps it can be explained by
the Moses Ascetic Order's theory that all things are numbers and numbers
have spirituality---nine and twenty-two have special mystical
significance."

When Madam Magician mentioned terms like Mother Goddess of Depravity,
Lumian suddenly felt as if numerous gazes were directed at him, though
they couldn't penetrate the grayish-white fog.

At this point, Mr. Fool lightly tapped the edge of the bronze long table
and added, "Normally, like Uniquenesses, sefirot cannot be divided,
copied, or destroyed. Only one situation can cause them to be torn
apart---encountering the Original Creator.

"He is the 'Exception', the 'Inconceivable', the 'Incomprehensible', the
'Indescribable'. All things that shouldn't happen might happen when
encountering Him---unknowable, undiscussable, unnameable.

"And it was this single instance of sefirot being torn apart that led
the Great Old Dominators to discover that torn sefirot could
self-complete.

"The sefirot of the Mother Goddess of Depravity that was torn into our
planet self-completed into the Brood Hive. The Mother Tree of Desire
lost titles such as 'Father of Devils' and 'Source of Curses', and they
perfected themselves into the Tenebrous World.

"Among them, the Son of Chaos had a somewhat different experience.
Whether His main consciousness was on the torn sefirot and followed it
inside the barrier, or He later used His special symbolism to project
His main consciousness inside to try to reclaim the torn sefirot,
ultimately, His main consciousness was either defeated or deceived by
the Celestial Worthy and sealed within a magic lamp formed from a
Miracle Invoker Beyonder characteristic---this is the origin of the
Grade 0 sealed artifact 0-05.

"The main consciousness of the Son of Chaos became Genie, the sefirot
torn inside the barrier self-completed into the Nation of Disorder,
while what remained outside the barrier was called the Uncertain
Mist---that is, the one worshiped by the Brokers, and the Uncertain Mist
has some consciousness."

After hearing Mr. Fool's account of the Son of Chaos's experience,
Lumian suddenly found the School of Truth's Brokers' search for Sealed
Artifact 0-05 somewhat amusing.

It was like saying "our god's brain is lost, please help us find it."

Beyond the humor, Lumian was more concerned about another matter.

"The Brood Hive... it's in the Western Continent?

"What you didn't explicitly say before, Mr. Fool, is that it was
possibly the Brood Hive that brought the Hidden Sage to life?"

"Yes, these matters are dangerous and corruptive for those without an
Angel's status---difficult to bear." Mr. Fool nodded slightly and said,
"In the middle to late period of the First Epoch, before the Celestial
Worthy's fall, He sealed seven sefirot---the Brood Hive, Nation of
Disorder, Tenebrous World, City of Calamity, River of Eternal Darkness,
Knowledge Moor, and Key of Light---in the Western Continent, to be
guarded by Penglai.

"As a result, faced with the approaching apocalypse, all true gods who
wanted to exceed the Sequence limitations to deal with the Outer
Deities' invasion had only one choice---to support the emergence of a
Lord of Mysteries to lift the seal, and the Celestial Worthy could then
be revived within the body of the new Lord of Mysteries."

*So Mr. Fool and I had similar experiences... he was nurtured by the
gods who were "forced" by the Celestial Worthy to ensure His revival,
while I was forcibly created by the Blood Emperor' revival efforts and
to achieve some goal for the Aurora Order's deity...* Lumian
felt somewhat emotional and reflective.

Mr. Fool continued, "The Celestial Worthy's fall came from that
primordial God Almighty who had also accommodated multiple sefirot. They
nearly perished together.

"Some of the Celestial Worthy's arrangements were for His own revival,
while others were meant to interfere with the primordial God Almighty's
revival, and vice versa.

"In short, there are many reasons why I was able to suppress the
Celestial Worthy this time: first, the help of the primordial God
Almighty; second, the Mother Goddess of Depravity had other plans and
didn't exert Her power; and third, the Celestial Worthy's arrangement of
sealing most sefirot in the Western Continent developed in ways He
hadn't prophesied.

"The Beyonders of the Western Continent, through generations of
sacrifice, managed to carve out a new path and grow stronger without a
potion system and with few Beyonder characteristics. For example, the
Celestial Master and the Underworld Daoist---They all have status and
power approaching that of deities, and could be even stronger if they
fought without regard for themselves. Penglai thus remained hidden.

"How could such high-level beings stand by and watch the Celestial
Worthy's revival and allow Penglai to play its role?"

*I see, the Celestial Worthy's backup plan was held back by the
Celestial Master and others? His arrangement to force everyone to
cultivate a Lord of Mysteries actually hindered His revival? Fate is
truly wonderful... Indeed, everyone only wants a Lord of Mysteries,
whether the Lord of Mysteries is The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and
Earth for Blessings doesn't matter...* Lumian looked at the
bronze long table in front of Mr. Fool, knowing this great existence
hadn't finished speaking.

Mr. Fool looked at him and Madam Magician and said, "After my initial
awakening, although I still can't lift the Western Continent's seal, I
can communicate somewhat with the Celestial Master through it.

"The Celestial Master told me that their sect's ancestral court had once
been breached and occupied by the Luo Sect, and many historical
Celestial Masters had romantic entanglements with Luo Sect holy maidens
and had children with them."

"Luo Sect..." Both The Chariot Lumian and Madam Magician Fors were
somewhat confused.

Mr. Fool smiled. "The Luo Sect has a saying: 'Unborn Ancient Mother,
True Void Homeland'."

*"Unborn Ancient Mother, True Void Homeland"... True Void Homeland...
Paramita?* Lumian suddenly understood. "This is a sect that
worships the Brood Hive? 'Unborn Ancient Mother' is a title for the
Brood Hive?"

Mr. Fool nodded. "Combined with the events described by the Celestial
Master, there's reason to believe the Knowledge Moor was once corrupted
and influenced by the Brood Hive at some point in the past.

"This might be why the Hidden Sage came to life."

*I see...* The Chariot Lumian finally connected all the pieces.

He raised another question. "Do the Mother Goddess of Depravity, Mother
Tree of Desire, and Uncertain Mist want to invade our world to reclaim
their torn sefirot?

"What other Great Old Dominators are outside the barrier? What are Their
goals?"

Madam Magician said with a slight headache, "Besides those three, others
wanting to invade our world include the Monarch of Decay---originally
worshiped by the Sick Church---the Primordial Hunger that Ludwig once
served, the Inextinguishable Ravings worshipped by the First Philosophy,
Supernova Dominator who was the original owner of that space ship from
the sea prayer ritual, the Circle of Inevitability that you're most
familiar with, the High-Dimensional Overseer of the Painter pathway, and
the Goddess of Fate worshiped by General Philip."

*Wh--- Isn't that a little too many? They even outnumber the true gods
within the barrier, and They're a level higher, having transcended the
Sequences Themselves...* Lumian was somewhat shocked, fear
briefly surfacing before being suppressed by courage.
