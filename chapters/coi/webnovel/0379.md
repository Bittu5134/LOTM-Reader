## Chapter 379: Bold Speculation

*Alone Bar?* Lumian was taken aback by the answer.

*Loki, the founder of the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society's April
Fools' team, is actually in Trier and connected to the Alone
Bar?*

*Isn't this a little too coincidental?*

Lumian's impression of the Alone Bar was that it stood diagonally
opposite Salle de Bal Unique. In the basement, there was a theater for
marionette shows. The lighting was dim, and the colors were dark, giving
it a slightly sinister appearance.

Initially, he didn't see it as a problem, but now that he knew that the
monocle-wearing patrons of Salle de Bal Unique were in a superimposed
state of being "Amon" and "Not Amon," he believed that the Alone Bar,
which could compete with this dance hall and survive, wasn't simple.

Moreover, he had once observed Leah from Bureau 8 entering the bar. He
suspected it to be Bureau 8's covert hideout, designed to keep an eye on
the Amons at Salle de Bal Unique.

Could Loki also be a member of Bureau 8, a true official Beyonder?

Or was it possible that he merely resided in Quartier de l'Observatoire
and recognized the uniqueness of Alone Bar? Was that why he used the
mechanical typewriter there to create a copy of the information,
preventing anyone from tracing it back to him?

"What's the matter?" Franca watched Lumian furrow his brow and plunge
into deep thought. After a prolonged silence, she extended her right
hand and waved it in front of his eyes.

Lumian contemplated for a moment and said, "There's a significant issue
with this bar."

"You're familiar with this bar?" Franca looked surprised.

This man appeared to harbor many secrets she was unaware of!

A soft chuckle escaped Lumian's lips.

"We'll need to start with Madame Hela and me searching for the Samaritan
Women's Spring."

Franca was taken aback. "How many times do I need to have you give out
every detail? Are you a tube of toothpaste, giving out a little with
each squeeze?"

"The focus was on the situation at the Samaritan Women's Spring, and
this all happened along the way," Lumian explained, without feeling
embarrassed.

Starting from his encounter with the Islander swindler, Monette, and his
repeated scares, he connected Charlie being swindled, the uniqueness of
Salle de Bal Unique, and Madam Magician's connection to Amon. Finally,
he mentioned that Alone Bar was diagonally opposite Salle de Bal Unique,
and an official member of Bureau 8 had once entered and exited.

Franca felt like she was listening to a ghost story. She subconsciously
wanted to hug a pillow, but there was none on the recliner.

Quickly shaking off her daze, she straightened her back, trying to
maintain an expression that suggested a "true man" wouldn't be
frightened by such a terrifying incident.

All this was used to torment Jenna!

After Lumian finished speaking, Franca hissed and said, "You've had
quite the array of experiences. You've even encountered an old monster
that only exists in horror stories."

"Why didn't you warn me earlier? That Islander swindler shows up in the
market district from time to time. What if I run into him one day?"

"It's for your own safety. If you didn't suspect anything when you
encountered him, he wouldn't pay you any attention. But now, if your
demeanor changes when you see him, he might become suspicious and
involve you in his Parasitism," Lumian warned, half-scaring Franca.

"That's true." Franca gritted her teeth and added, "The next time I meet
him, I'll pray for the angel's protection from Mr. Fool when I get
home!"

She pushed aside her fear of the Amons and steered the conversation back
to the main topic.

"This all ties into the Alone Bar. Investigating it in the future is
going to be very challenging..."

Franca suddenly had an imaginative guess.

"Do you think Loki has already been parasitized by an Amon?"

Lumian struggled to follow Franca's train of thought and responded,
"Huh?"

Franca continued, her tone grave, "Consider this. The books and legends
of the Ancient Sun God have been missing for two to three thousand
years, and since the Churches of the Seven Gods' bibles are copied from
Him, they must have erased relevant information. How did Loki come by
this information?

"While there are various possibilities, if he is indeed Amon, it would
make sense. No one knows His father's situation better than Him.

"As a child of a transmigrator, not to mention that He can obtain Loki's
memories through Parasitism, even if He can't, He can perfectly act as
our companion. You also mentioned that He enjoys deceit and has
frightened you a few times. This is very similar to Loki's usual
behavior.

"And when Amon from Salle de Bal Unique created the duplicate, he
deliberately went to the Alone Bar diagonally opposite to use a
mechanical typewriter to mislead potential tracing. This also fits with
this style."

Franca's bold imagination surprised Lumian. After a moment of thought,
he responded, "This does explain why this information oddly points to
the Alone Bar.

"Under the guidance of this evil Angel, the April Fool's team gradually
felt despair for the future and pursued their own joy. It was a
reasonable development for them to start targeting other members of the
Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society.

"However, Amon wouldn't intentionally lead the information to the Alone
Bar, as that would naturally make investigators suspect Him, who resides
diagonally opposite...

"Perhaps He anticipated the investigators' thoughts," Franca countered.

Lumian shook his head slowly.

"If it were Amon, your divination would have been misled or you wouldn't
have received an answer.

"Yes, regardless, this is indeed a possibility. I plan to visit the
Alone Bar for a drink in the next two days and investigate the situation
on the ground, but I won't delve further."

Franca acknowledged his words tersely and sighed.

"In truth, I also realize that the likelihood of Loki being parasitized
by an Amon is very low. Our primary purpose in attending the gathering
is to transition into a special state. In this state, the Sealed
Artifact borrowed from Madame Hela should be able to detect any
abnormalities in each member's bodies. It won't transform the
corresponding object and leave it where it is.

"Sigh, I'm just finding excuses for myself. It's not wise for us to
pursue Loki without substantial evidence and strong suspicion.

"It makes me feel like I've betrayed the Research Society and my
companions. That's why I hope that Loki was indeed parasitized by Amon.
That way, I won't experience a similar sense of guilt. I'd be helping
the Research Society eliminate hidden dangers."

*Filtering abnormalities in the body by entering a special state and
attending the gathering? But nothing happened to Termiboros...*
Lumian wondered if it was because Mr. Fool's seal was unique or if
Madame Hela's Sealed Artifact lacked the ability to filter abnormalities
and guard against parasitic Angels like Amon.

However, he didn't voice any objections at the moment and instead
smiled.

"In my view, there's definitely something amiss with Loki. It's just a
question of whether it's a major or minor issue.

"When he sold you the information, did he encourage you to explore the
underground and seek out more remnants of the Ancient Sun God?"

"He did," Franca confirmed. "He also mentioned that in such places, the
higher the Sequence, the more dangerous it is. It's easier to lose
control. Only Low-Sequence Beyonders like us can approach it."

"That's only a relative perspective. Did you find it dangerous when I
explored the Samaritan Women's Spring earlier?" Lumian inquired.

"It was extremely dangerous," Franca acknowledged, knowing much about
the matter.

*And you don't even know that the Blood Emperor's apparition nearly
caught me...* Lumian muttered, "Searching for the remnants of
the Ancient Sun God will likely be even more dangerous.

"If Loki doesn't make an attempt, he'll be essentially using you as
cannon fodder by encouraging you to explore underground. And if he does
try, he'll inevitably be corrupted and gradually mutate. He lacks the
purification of a great existence like Mr. Fool.

"So, it's crucial to locate Loki as soon as possible. It's in both your
and his best interests."

Franca bit her lip and agreed, "You're right. Loki clearly has malicious
intentions in this matter. The other members of the April Fool's team
might be curious and willing to participate, but I believe they're
cooperating with him."

After persuading Franca, Lumian asked curiously, "Tell me, the
prerequisite for entering the gathering is to enter a special state.
What state is it?"

Franca, no longer hesitating, shared eagerly, "I've asked my Major
Arcana card holder about it before. Although I couldn't reveal the
incantation or provide a detailed description of the gathering, she
speculated that it involves a 'Concealment' power based on my
description and its effects."

*"Concealment" power...* Lumian nodded.

It was indeed well-concealed. Even the incantation had been hidden,
preventing anyone from discovering it.

Franca went on, "The power of Concealment is associated with the
Evernight pathway, which is the divine pathway controlled by the
Evernight Goddess Church."

She lowered her voice and added, "I suspect that Madame Hela is
affiliated with the Church of Evernight."

"Similar to 007?" Lumian inquired. He hadn't encountered 007 today, as
too many people had participated in the gathering, and he didn't know
the usual attire or team of 007.

Franca tersely confirmed his assumption.

"Something along those lines, but she may hold a more significant
position. She's at a higher level and has access to more concealed
knowledge."

Recalling Madame Hela's actions in obtaining the Samaritan Women's
Spring, Lumian couldn't help but agree with Franca's assessment.

Indeed, the lady possessed a wealth of secret knowledge. Moreover, she
wore a black diamond ring that clearly exceeded ordinary mystical items
and was suspected to possess godlike powers.

Additionally, the Sealed Artifact she had borrowed to convene the
gathering was beyond Lumian's imagination.

In a casual manner, Lumian asked, "What are the primary manifestations
of the Evernight pathway's powers?"

According to Aurore's grimoires, the first three Sequences of this
pathway were Sleepless, Midnight Poet, and Nightmare. They primarily
involved enhancing spirituality, increasing mental strength, reducing
the need for sleep, the mystical application of poetry, and the unique
ability to induce sleep in others.

Franca thought for a moment and replied, "The power of Concealment,
command over spirits, and the ability to create realistic dreams..."

*Realistic dream...* Lumian was taken aback by the answer.

He couldn't help but recall the realistic dream he had experienced in
the ruins of Cordu.
