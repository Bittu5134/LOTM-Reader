## Chapter 1060: The First Priest

*It's both a hidden danger and a risk, as well as a variable and an
opportunity? I understand what the hidden danger and risk are, but how
is the variable and opportunity manifested?* Lumian did not ask
further; his spiritual intuition told him this was a revelation, a scene
that Mr. Fool had seen in the river of fate, something that could not be
explained in detail.

After a moment's thought, he decided, "What should I do next?"

This was about what to do after clarifying the situation with the infant
Omebella in Madame Pualis's arms and understanding what Zedus
represented.

The Fool looked at Lumian, his voice still somewhat drifting. "Calamity
needs to stay away from the mother."

*Stay away from the mother? Does this mean avoiding meetings with Madame
Pualis and the infant Omebella? I can't even touch the Great Mother
unless the barrier fails, and if the barrier does fail, touching the
Great Mother would be meaningless...* Lumian pondered the true
meaning of Mr. Fool's latest revelation.

Suddenly, he thought of more possibilities.

The mother might not only refer to the Great Mother, but also Earth
Mother of the Feynapotter Kingdom!

*Does this mean I have to stay away from Earth Mother and Her proxies,
and even avoid touching any sacred objects that could point to Her?
After all, as the Sanguine ancestor and the former ancient god of the
Moon pathway, using the identity of Omebella, with the true god status
of the Earth pathway, She has existed for thousands of years. Even now,
after removing the "theft" and abandoning the corresponding identity,
there would inevitably be a very strong mystical connection with
Omebella...* Lumian nodded thoughtfully. "Yes, Mr. Fool."

Regarding matters related to Omebella, he already had a very deep
understanding, long knowing that the Sanguine ancestor Lilith, with the
help of the Ancient Sun God, had killed Omebella, "stolen" Her identity,
and then assumed Omebella's name to become Earth Mother, playing a
crucial role in the war a few years ago.

When Mr. Fool indicated he could leave, Lumian made his final request,
"Can you help me remove the seal on my chest?"

Since the soul fragments of Aurore and the infant Zedus had already
initially merged with himself, they would not perish whether the seal
was protected or not. This would allow the villagers of Cordu to find
peace!

They had no hope of resurrection and would only exist in the form of
Lumian's puppet soldiers, which he was unwilling to do.

"Okay." The Fool agreed to Lumian's request.

Before Lumian could speak, this great existence leaned back in his
chair, speaking in a calm voice, "The seal will be automatically removed
in three minutes."

"Praise you, Mr. Fool!" Lumian stood up, pressing his hand to his chest
in a salute.

Returning to the real world, Lumian, accompanied by Franca and Jenna,
bid farewell to Mr. Sun and returned to the luxurious villa in Trier.

After briefly mentioning Mr. Fool's new revelation and his own
understanding, he chose to teleport away alone.

His destination: Cordu Village, in the Dariège region of Riston
Province.

Soon, Lumian's figure took shape in that familiar yet strange
"hometown".

Glancing at the blood-red pillar that wasn't particularly high yet had a
mountainous feel, and then looking at his family house some distance
away, Lumian walked into the buildings surrounding the pillar.

He surveyed the house ruins, some completely collapsed, others burned,
trying to discern their original appearance.

Walking step by step through the broken walls and ruins, a pure and
brilliant starlight emerged from Lumian's chest.

As the starlight dispersed, fragments of radiance flew out from his
body, falling around him and materializing into blurry figures.

These were Naferia, Nazélie, and other elderly women, various Pierres
and Guillaumes. Some gathered together, basking in the noon sun,
chatting about village matters; others carried farming tools, returning
home; some playing with children, chasing and frolicking, or herding a
group of white geese...

The ruins suddenly became lively.

Lumian looked around, but no one paid him any attention.

Those figures were slowly fading.

Lumian smiled, nimbly climbing onto the top of a nearby building's
ruins, lying down, letting his black hair pile beside him.

It was noon, bright and sunny, almost dazzling. White clouds drifted
slowly across the blue sky.

The scent of spring grass and building stones, accompanied by sounds of
conversation, chasing, and laughter, quickly penetrated Lumian's mind,
making him feel warm in the sunlight, drowsy.

He closed his eyes, letting his thoughts drift.

The surroundings gradually became quiet, returning to silence.

___

In the previously rented apartment in Trier.

Lugano, with his handsome features and robust build, was reading the
latest medical journal while skewering a piece of sausage to eat.

For nearly a month, he had been living quite leisurely, with his salary
paid in advance and nothing much to do.

As a genuine Doctor, he could easily earn money even without running a
clinic.

The only issue was that he could still only access the mystical circle
he already knew, unable to obtain higher-sequence potion formulas or
corresponding items.

He had recently discovered that the activities of that mystical circle
had completely stopped, with the official forces in Trier unprecedented
in their strength.

*Ah, I both want the boss to come back quickly, yet fear his
return...* Lugano couldn't help but sigh.

At that moment, he saw the bedroom door open, and his long-awaited
employer walked out, as if he had never left.

"Good evening, boss!" Lugano jumped up, reflexively greeting him.

Lumian, who had been secretly observing him for some time, nodded
slightly.

"I have something for you to do."

Lugano, dazzled by his employer's appearance, instinctively asked, "What
is it?"

The boss seems even more beautiful, his charm greatly increased. What
happened... he muttered inwardly.

Lumian took out a list. "Visit each person on this list, tell them you
are a Blessed and priest of the Malady God, and then maintain contact
with them, responsible for preaching and conducting mass.

"Uh..." Lugano was stunned.

Is this a cult?

Lumian chuckled in response.

"Don't worry, the authorities have given the go ahead.

"If any of the Malady God followers have any illnesses, just treat them.
The consultation fee depends on the family's situation---charge normal
rates for the wealthy, and nothing for those without means."

The people on this list were all Malady God followers in Trier. Their
previous Blessed had recently informed Lumian through prayer that the
Beyonders from the two major Churches were watching closely, and they
didn't dare to make contact.

Lumian had responded in time, granting them death.

Then, through the Church of The Fool, he communicated that a Saint from
the Church of The Fool had taken over these followers to the Eternal
Blazing Sun Church and the God of Steam and Machinery Church, and would
be responsible for reforming them, so they no longer needed to keep
watch.

This matter of openly poaching followers, after private communication
and promises, had finally been tacitly approved.

Since Lumian couldn't personally preach, and couldn't do everything
himself, he thought of Lugano.

He was a genuine Doctor who could treat illnesses while preaching, truly
embodying the authority of the Malady God!

Lugano suddenly understood. "The Sick Church is going legitimate?

"Are you now a follower of the Malady God?"

Lumian glanced at Lugano and said with a smile, "I am the Malady God."

"..." Lugano was stunned again.

"And also the patron saint of the Church of The Fool," Lumian continued.

This was something he couldn't hide from Lugano.

*My boss has become a patron saint? Become the Malady God? What am I
now?* Lugano was bewildered and fearful for two seconds. "What
should I tell these followers?"

*Do I have scriptures to read, a mass to conduct?*

Lumian took out a stack of documents.

"The Malady God has now split into the God of Plague and the God of
Disease---one is me, the other is Franca. When preaching to these
followers, do not mention our real names or the Church of The Fool for
now. Follow what's written on these papers.

"These doctrines are still quite simple, and those followers won't
understand anything complex. We'll slowly modify and add to them once
they truly believe in me and Franca."

"Yes, boss, no..." Lugano suddenly knelt on one knee, head lowered,
"Yes, great Lumian Lee."

This is also an anchor---an anchor with potential risks... Lumian nodded
satisfactorily.

"Several on the list were originally bestowed of the Malady God. I've
already punished them, and they're now dead. Go to the addresses on the
list to collect their bodies and take away their ill-gotten gains.

"In the name of me and Franca, return these funds to the followers,
especially those living in difficult circumstances. The remainder can be
used as expenses for your preaching.

"Afterwards, don't mention donations to the followers, but if they
actively donate and the money won't affect their family's life, don't
refuse.

"After completing this task, I'll help you find the potion formula and
corresponding Beyonder ingredients for the next sequence."

Still kneeling on one knee, Lugano's heart leaped, and he blurted out,
"Praise you, great Lumian Lee!"

Lumian gestured for him to rise while saying, "Franca and I are now
Sequence 3 Saints. Our honorific names are in these documents. God of
Plague is me, God of Disease is her. If you have anything, contact us by
reciting the honorific name."

"I shall obey your will," Lugano quickly responded.

As the boss was about to leave, he instinctively asked, "How is Ludwig?
You must be very busy and have no time to take care of him. If he gets
too hungry, he might eat people."

*Is this the Mother pathway?* Lumian thought to himself, then
said with a smile, "Don't worry about him. He can now cook for himself
using the ingredients we prepared."

Moreover, Ludwig was about to have a big feast.
