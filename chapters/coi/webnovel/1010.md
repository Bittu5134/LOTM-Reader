## Chapter 1010: Interpreting Symbols

Lumian organized his thoughts and explained about the manifestations
possibly being an identity, "Zhou Mingrui's" identity lacking
corresponding interpersonal relationships, Peng Deng and Zhang Yujia's
existence seeming more special, and Peng Deng's roommate Grisha
appearing in the emergency center of Mushu Hospital.

"From a transmigrator's perspective, there are indeed problems with the
corresponding details. Zhou Mingrui seems to be just a name, while the
person who shares an apartment with Siatas and others, works at the
Intis Group, and has a brother named Benson and a sister named Sasa is
more like Klein Moretti." Madam Justice nodded slowly. "Except for the
dream city itself and Peng Deng and Zhang Yujia, no other important
figures originate from the First Epoch or before."

She temporarily treated the super-ancient era mentioned by Two of Cups
as history from the First Epoch or before.

So far, the Tarot Club had almost no understanding of events before the
Second Epoch.

As she spoke, Madam Justice fell silent, seeming lost in thought.

Madam Magician glanced at her and said to Lumian, "Since Peng Deng and
Grisha may involve the Ancient Sun God, let me first tell you the
relevant information we know, of course, limited to the part you can
access."

At this moment, Jenna sensed the activity in the living room and came
down from the second floor.

She looked around, quietly found a place to sit down, and joined Lumian
in listening to Madam Magician talk about matters related to the Ancient
Sun God.

Madam Magician considered for a moment and said, "I've told you before
that the source of all supernatural powers can be traced back to the
original Creator."

Lumian and Jenna nodded simultaneously.

Madam Magician continued, "The original Creator created this world, and
at some point disintegrated Himself, splitting into the Beyonder
characteristics of different pathways. Well, it may have been the
terrifying impact of His self-disintegration that completely destroyed
the super-ancient civilization where Mr. Fool and Two of Cups lived,
with only some humans surviving, ushering in the First Epoch, what we
call the Chaos Epoch."

"Was the Celestial Worthy born at that time? Mr. Fool and Franca should
have been suspended above that light door before the collapse of the
super-ancient civilization," Lumian said words that Jenna currently
couldn't understand the specific meaning of.

Madam Magician pondered for a few seconds and said, "Based on the
knowledge we currently possess, the final Creator simultaneously had
tendencies towards separation and convergence. Before He completely
disintegrated, there should have already been a split in His
personality, or rather, His divine nature. The Celestial Worthy may
belong to one of the divine natures that split off, so the Celestial
Worthy's spiritual imprint, like that of the original Creator, cannot be
erased and will always exist within the corresponding Beyonder
characteristics."

Jenna understood this part and blurted out, "Then doesn't that mean Mr.
Fool can never truly defeat the Celestial Worthy?"

"He can only both merge and oppose, gaining some advantage over the long
course of time," Madam Magician said with a bitter smile. "There's a
saying in the dream city that makes a lot of sense: In the long run, we
all die."

Lumian, Jenna, and the others fell silent.

Madam Magician composed herself and said, "Other divine natures also
split off at that time, one of which you can call God Almighty.

"The history of the First Epoch might be the history of God Almighty
opposing the Celestial Worthy. This is our only understanding of that
period of history, and we can't guarantee its accuracy. Anyway, at the
end of the First Epoch, something unknown happened, and both fell
simultaneously. The Beyonder characteristics split more thoroughly, and
the first Blasphemy Slate was left behind in some secret place."

The first Blasphemy Slate that recorded the twenty-two paths of the
divine.

"Did God Almighty occupy the pathways of Spectator and Secrets
Suppliant?" Lumian roughly understood what Madam Magician wanted to say.

Madam Magician nodded and said, "The five pathways of Spectator, Secrets
Suppliant, Reader, Sailor, and Bard, symbolizing omniscience and
omnipotence."

"Five pathways..." It wasn't Lumian or Jenna who marveled, but Madam
Justice.

Of course, Lumian and Jenna were also shocked---the Celestial Worthy and
Mr. Fool only occupied three pathways!

"The number of pathways isn't the key to how powerful these great
existences are," Madam Magician briefly explained without going into
detail. "The Ancient Sun God became a deity based on the Bard pathway,
collecting the Uniqueness and the minimum required Sequence 1 Beyonder
characteristics of the corresponding pathways. Later, He was betrayed
and fell, splitting apart. But various signs indicate that before His
fall, He had actually encountered what Mr. Fool experienced---God
Almighty had revived within Him.

"After the Ancient Sun God fell, His legacy was divided into five parts.
One part He had pre-divided to the Angel of Imagination, another part
nurtured the True Creator and the second Blasphemy Slate on His remains,
and the remaining three parts were divided among the three Kings of
Angels at the time."

Madam Magician didn't say what happened to those three Kings of Angels
later, but Lumian and Jenna vaguely guessed something.

"A few years ago, that Angel of Imagination became a god and obtained,
well, I don't know if it was the second or first Blasphemy Slate.
Anyway, He used it to go to the Forsaken Land of the Gods and merge with
the True Creator.

"That's roughly how things are. I can't guarantee the accuracy of the
specific details," Madam Magician finally said.

As soon as she finished speaking, Madam Justice emerged from her
contemplation and looked at Lumian and Jenna, saying, "I have a guess
about the identities and symbolism of Peng Deng, Grisha, and Zhang
Yujia."

___

In the dream city, inside a coffee shop.

After handing Ludwig over to Franca, Anthony used the pretext of
continuing their previous consultation to arrange a meeting with Peng
Deng.

He was prepared to rent an unfurnished apartment and pay a renovation
deposit. After all, Zhou Shasha would arrive in Yang City the day after
tomorrow, and they might not even have a chance to spend the remaining
money they had!

Seeing Peng Deng put down his black laptop backpack and sit across from
him, Anthony smiled and greeted him, "I have a friend who knows Zhou
Mingrui. I heard you're Zhou Mingrui's childhood friend?"

Anthony wasn't worried that this statement would trigger too obvious a
change, as it was a common negotiation tactic---drawing closer to get a
better price.

After placing his phone to his right, Peng Deng raised his head.

A smile appeared on his unremarkable face. "Yes, I'm not only Zhou
Mingrui's childhood friend, I'm also other people's childhood friend."

*Childhood friend of others... Why specifically emphasize this? Whose
childhood friend is he besides?* Anthony's mind suddenly tensed.

*†*

Trier, inside a luxurious villa.

Madam Justice stood up and used her right hand to draw a
semi-transparent, dreamlike wooden board.

"Peng Deng once made Four of Swords have hallucinations due to his own
fear, causing him to actively leave the dream," Madam Justice said while
making Peng Deng's photo and this sentence materialize virtually and
stick to the wooden board.

Next, she outlined Grisha's portrait.

"This is Peng Deng's roommate, who appeared in the emergency center of
Mushu Hospital last night.

"This is Nie Zhen, Peng Deng's girlfriend."

After adding Nie Zhen's illusory photo, Madam Justice paused and said,
"This is the boss of Aurora Company, and Aurora Company corresponds to
the Aurora Order in reality. Their boss most likely symbolizes that True
Creator, closely related to the Ancient Sun God."

As she spoke, Madam Justice also pasted the photo of the half-naked body
of Aurora Company's boss onto the dreamlike wooden board.

After two seconds, Madam Justice continued in a slow voice, "Zhang Yujia
once sent Zhou Mingrui a postcard with an image of Sedlec Ossuary.

"For a long time, the Sedlec Ossuary was the iconic possession of the
Angel of Imagination."

After Zhang Yujia's file photo was also pasted onto the illusory wooden
board, Madam Justice smiled and said, "When the Spectator pathway
reaches the sequence of Dreamweaver, one can split off past identities
or personalities, turning them into seemingly real people who can sleep
normally, eat normally, socialize normally, and work normally.

"Now, there are a total of five people listed on the blackboard, and
there are five pathways related to omniscience and omnipotence..."

Before Madam Justice could state her conclusion, Anthony suddenly came
down from upstairs.

Seeing Madam Magician, Lumian, and the others, he explained, "After
interacting with Peng Deng today, I was kicked out of the dream. This
time it wasn't because of fear.

"However, I gleaned some information from Peng Deng's hints."

Seeing everyone's eyes turn to him, Anthony paused, then said solemnly,
"Peng Deng is not only Zhou Mingrui's childhood friend, he's likely also
the Celestial Worthy's childhood friend!"

Hearing this, Madam Justice's lips curved slightly, revealing a smile.

She pointed at the illusory photos on the semi-transparent blackboard
and said, "It's the same for Peng Deng, and the same for Zhang Yujia.

"Peng Deng's girlfriend Nie Zhen and his roommate Grisha, as well as the
boss of Aurora Company whose origin is easiest to discern, all point to
the same symbolism."

"The Celestial Worthy's childhood friend is God Almighty?" Lumian
roughly understood what Peng Deng specifically symbolized.

And this symbolism, influenced by the characteristics of the Spectator
pathway, had undergone a split, not just in Peng Deng, but in the other
four people as well.

"One of the people who least wants the Celestial Worthy to resurrect
might be that God Almighty, which is why He specifically arranged to
guide you to discover the corresponding psychological trauma in the
underground area of Mushu Hospital," Madam Magician said in a tone of
sudden realization.

Madam Justice thought for a moment and said in a lowered voice, "If the
one currently worshiped by the Aurora Order enters the dream, He should
be able to choose one of these five forms as His body. It could be Peng
Deng, it could be Nie Zhen, it could be Grisha, it could be Zhang Yujia,
or it could be the boss of Aurora Company."

Madam Magician suddenly had a new idea.

"Peng Deng and Grisha are roommates, and Nie Zhen is about to move in
with them. Does this symbolize that the trinity is merging?

"Does moving out represent separation and opposition?"
