## Chapter 333: Gains

Lumian's smile gradually softened as he watched the Spirit Body writhing
and wailing within the flames.

This was one of the ways the padre died as he had predicted.

Certainly, when he initially ignited the Abyss Demon Flowers,
transforming the derelict mine within the Bottle of Fiction into a fiery
inferno, he hadn't anticipated Guillaume Bénet's direct incineration.

During that moment, he had relied on his combat instincts and seasoned
experience to create an environment that favored his strengths and
mitigated his most vulnerable points. The summoning of the Abyss Demon
Flowers by the padre had presented an opportunity.

The anesthetic gas produced by the incineration of the Abyss Demon
Flowers wasn't his intention. His aim was to battle within an infernal
hell.

During that period, his remaining spirituality had been scarce.
Nonetheless, a Pyromaniac's resistance to flames significantly
outclassed a Fate Appropriator's. Moreover, this resistance was a
physical attribute that didn't deplete his spirituality.

As the Bottle of Fiction transformed into a blazing inferno, even the
very air could scorch the trachea and lungs. Lumian believed he would
ultimately prevail. He could outlast Guillaume Bénet, enduring until the
flames extinguished themselves due to lack of fuel.

With his grasp of the Inevitability pathway, and in the absence of
unforeseen deviations for Sequence 6 Beyonders, Guillaume Bénet's
constitution was merely more robust than that of an ordinary person. His
strength lay in his flexibility and tolerance, rather than fire
resistance.

Lumian's observations during the Cordu confrontations validated this
point. Both Guillaume Bénet and Pierre Berry, individuals who had
clearly progressed beyond Sequence 7, exhibited remarkable combat
capabilities, albeit lacking commensurate defensive attributes.

Lumian hadn't anticipated the padre contracting the Steel Body ability.
This ability possessed pros and cons. On the one hand, it thwarted
Lumian's initial plan for an infernal hell. On the other hand, it
curtailed the padre's own capabilities, granting Lumian an opportunity
to contend more effectively and unseal the entrance to the Bottle of
Fiction. This would permit his accomplice to join the fray and offer
assistance. Lumian subsequently exploited Guillaume Bénet's
determination to eliminate unnecessary obstructions by dealing with
Franca first. He then improvised, crafting a lethal snare.

Amidst the sizzle of burning air, Guillaume Bénet's wailing Spirit Body
disintegrated swiftly, gradually dissipating.

With the task accomplished, Lumian pivoted, acknowledging Franca and
Jenna with a nod, signifying his completion.

In the ensuing instant, he staggered toward the altar, retrieving the
skins of cow, sheep, and dog.

These items were whole, exuding a sinister aura upon closer inspection.

These constituted specialized hides, amassed through the initial half of
the Animal Creation Spell ritual, harnessed by leveraging Ascetic powers
for accumulation. Upon grasping the corresponding incantation and
enveloping individuals and oneself with these skins, the Animal Creation
Spell could be executed outright.

Although Lumian hadn't yet deciphered the predetermined incantation for
animal creation or its nullification, these obstacles could be
surmounted in due course. He could, for instance, detain Paulina, the
padre's butler, and others to determine if they possessed such
knowledge. Alternatively, he could engage a Cryptologist of the Marauder
pathway to decode the incantation. He could even resort to trial and
error, applying his knowledge of the Inevitability domain and his
comprehension of Guillaume Bénet's persona. Last of all, he could use
divination to get any clarity on success.

Thus, these two sheepskins, a single cowhide, and two dogskins held
considerable value. Employed judiciously, they could unleash
unparalleled effects. Guillaume Bénet had nearly beguiled Lumian
previously by adopting the guise of a massive, brown-furred dog,
attempting to flee Rue Vincent and sever their destined encounter.
However, his fanaticism in Inevitability's boon and his greed due to his
contract had overridden reason. This led him to transition from prey to
hunter, setting a trap in reverse.

When Lumian's body began to sway as if he had lost his footing, Franca
and Jenna lent their support, each helping him bear a share of the cow,
sheep, and dog skins.

In that instant, the Bottle of Fiction quaked.

Stripped of Guillaume Bénet's reinforcement and subjected to the
infernal hellfire for a duration, it eventually fractured akin to ice,
its fragments plunging into the void.

The derelict cavern, encompassed by its confinement, unveiled itself to
Lumian and his companions through the secret door. All the Abyss Demon
Flowers had been reduced to ashes and strewn across the ground. The
flames had exhausted their combustibles, and bereft of Lumian's
spirituality, most had dwindled to cinders. Only select regions
persisted with a crimson luminescence, which was waning steadily.

Lumian glanced at Franca and said, "I'll head back to Rue des Blouses
Blanches through Underground Trier. Carry the Earth Blood ore as you
make your way to the surface."

Once the Decency brooch was removed, Lumian would inevitably be scorned
by those around him. Should he retrace his steps, numerous mishaps could
befall him. Alternatively, if he didn't remove it, an alert would be
triggered within two to three minutes, attracting the attention of
nearby official Beyonders or concealed factions.

Given the potential complications involved in carrying the Earth Blood
ore into the underground, coupled with the possible difficulties Jenna
might encounter upon receiving it, Franca nodded, pursing her lips, and
turned toward Jenna. "Follow Ciel. He's at his limit. He might not even
stand a chance against a dog."

"If it's the same dog as before, I wouldn't be able to defeat it,"
Lumian muttered.

As the exit on the opposite side of the abandoned mine remained
unobstructed, a frigid gust swept into the sacrificial hall, dispersing
the anesthetic gas with the fragmentation of the Bottle of Fiction.
Lumian staggered onward, arriving at the charred remains of Guillaume
Bénet.

He kicked the body and turned it over, ensuring nothing was concealed
within.

Lumian picked up the iron-gray military alcohol flask and advanced
toward the abandoned mine's exit. There, he noticed a brown-furred dog
skin that no longer bore a sinister aura.

This particular area had avoided incineration, leaving the dog skin
intact. Nevertheless, the process of reconstituting the Animal Creation
Spell ritual was mandatory. Only through the application of an Ascetic's
ability could it regain its status as a Beyonder item.

Beyond the abandoned mine's exit, two objects were propped against the
rocky wall.

One comprised a kerosene-lit lantern, while the other was a dark-green
canvas backpack favored by adventurers and mercenaries.

Lumian hoisted the backpack, finding it surprisingly weighty. It was
almost too heavy to lift.

Curious, Franca crouched down and unfastened the backpack. Within it lay
gratifying gold bars, stacks of banknotes, and golden coins.

"Wow!" Franca exclaimed.

*So much money?* Lumian's initial thought was: *Thank goodness,
the padre didn't expend all of Aurore's accrued royalties. This was
followed by a rather visceral reaction: Fucking dammit, this man is so
sinister!*

Evidently, Guillaume Bénet had anticipated the possibility that Paulina
and the others might not escape. In such an eventuality, Lumian and his
companions could deduce that the padre had chosen an alternate escape
route based on the scarce funds carried by these Inevitability
believers. Consequently, they would converge on the basement,
inadvertently walking into a trap.

"Not too shabby, not at all," Franca remarked, grinning. "While these
heretics might not drop characteristics, they do drop other spoils."

Indicating upward with her hand, she continued, "I'm heading back up.
Pass me this dog skin."

She relinquished the three ritualistic hides to Jenna and returned to 50
Rue Vincent, clutching Guillaume Bénet's dog skin.

Jenna slung the dark-green canvas bag over her shoulder, gripping the
five sinister hides. She observed as Lumian picked up the lantern and
kindled it.

After a few strides through the dim tunnel outside the abandoned mine,
Lumian promptly removed the Decency brooch and placed it in another
military alcohol flask hanging from his waist, sinking it to the bottom
of the liquor.

Lumian took a few more steps before suddenly shuddering. He turned
around, glancing at Jenna who was trailing behind.

Jenna, clasping the cow, sheep, and dog skins while toting the canvas
bag, bore a somber expression, marked by repugnance. She struggled to
speak, her voice faltering, "I-I can control myself. Dammit, I won't
beat you up!"

Though Lumian was skeptical, he had no choice but to continue his
journey.

After seven to eight minutes, he encountered an abandoned tunnel and
settled into a corner, awaiting the dissipation of the Decency brooch's
adverse effects. He seized the opportunity to rest and recuperate some
of his spirituality.

†

The events that transpired at 50 Rue Vincent remained unknown to anyone
as Franca methodically erased all evidence and conducted an
anti-divination process in the manner befitting a Demoness.

Throughout this endeavor, she combed through every room. Vigilant
against potential corruption, she refrained from delving too deeply,
though her explorations yielded neither valuable clues nor significant
items of interest.

Ultimately, she returned to the parlor on the ground floor, rousing the
unconscious impostor Guillaume Bénet.

The imposter Guillaume Bénet gazed at the cloaked figure adorned in a
black robe, a brown dog skin clutched within her grasp. For a fleeting
moment, he experienced a sensation akin to being trapped within a dream,
unable to awaken.

Franca emitted a soft chuckle.

"As you can see, we've killed that devil."

In her eyes, the imposter Guillaume Bénet was no longer identical to the
padre. He had become very unfamiliar.

Perhaps this was his true appearance.

"I-I..." The imposter Guillaume Bénet stammered in surprise and elation,
"Are you here to aid me?"

"We're Demon Hunters," Franca fabricated. "What else can you tell us
about this devil?"

Though her Magic Mirror Spirit Channeling Spell enabled Lumian to glean
extensive information from Guillaume Bénet, its reach had limitations.
It could not cover every facet. Further inquiry into relevant
individuals was imperative to avert the risk of overlooking crucial
leads.

The imposter Guillaume Bénet found the shrouded woman before him
remarkably affable. He contemplated briefly before responding, "Other
than engaging in an affair with my wife and indulging in steak and
mutton chops, there's nothing particularly remarkable about that devil.

"Yes... I-it vanishes for one day each week before resurfacing without
fanfare."

*Disappearing once a week?* Franca acknowledged this detail and
pursued further inquiries.

Having exhausted the potential for extracting additional information,
she smiled and subtly instigated the imposter Guillaume Bénet.

"If I were in your position, I'd hastily depart this location. Your wife
is akin to a devil.

"I would relocate any valuable possessions to regions where my identity
remains unknown. I'd purchase a new residence, enter a fresh marriage,
and embark on a new chapter."

Guillaume Bénet's heartbeat hastened, and his resolve to stand his
ground waned.

In the ensuing moment, he observed the woman before him liquefy akin to
melting ice.
