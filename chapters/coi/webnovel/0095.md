## Chapter 95: An "Out in the Open" Ambush

Lumian meticulously wrapped his left hand in layers of white bandages.
He gathered his supplies: Fallen Mercury, his iron-black axe, gray amber
perfume, biscuits, cheese, bloodied mutton chops, rope for traps, and a
bag of cooled boiled water. Slipping his shotgun over his shoulder, he
left his semi-subterranean dwelling.

Through the thin gray fog, he ventured into a barren wasteland, riddled
with cracks. He entered the dreamlike ruins and strode toward the
clearing where the flaming monster often lurked.

Hearing a distant noise, Lumian veered towards a path he anticipated the
creature would take, arriving at a natural trap he'd discovered earlier.

A deep pit lay beside the road, with collapsed walls to the front and
left. Stacked rocks bordered the right side, and behind it, a mostly
collapsed house loomed.

Such a trap was difficult to spot. Lumian had found it only after
scouring the area multiple times.

He crouched behind the pit, tossing in a few sharpened wooden stakes. He
covered it with a rope net he'd woven earlier and camouflaged it with
soil.

With the simple trap set, he placed his bait: two blood-soaked lamb
chops, half on solid ground and half suspended above the pit.

Lumian stepped back, assessing the precarious balance. He retreated into
the mostly collapsed house, perching himself on the remains of an outer
wall.

He adjusted his position to watch the trap without being seen by passing
monsters.

Next, he took out the gray amber perfume and sprayed it on the wall.

A delicate, sweet scent wafted through the air, carried by sporadic
gusts of wind that blew through the ruins.

The fragrance clung to the wall and to Lumian.

Without hesitation, he leaped away, looping back to the path where the
flaming monster would appear, positioning himself closer to its hunting
grounds.

Once more, he changed direction, crossing the path and entering the
ruins of a building opposite.

Reaching the rear of the crumbling structure, he stopped, leaned against
the wall, and waited.

As with his strategy against the shotgun monster, Lumian never expected
his trap to fool the flaming monster or wound it severely.

These decoys and alarms targeted the creature's keen senses,
observation, and behavior.

Only a Hunter knew how to exploit a Hunter's strengths!

Of course, all this relied on the target operating primarily on
instinct, its intelligence limited to combat.

Leaning against the wall, Lumian gripped Fallen Mercury in his bandaged
left hand, tearing off the pitch-black cloth shrouding its surface.

He couldn't know how long it would take for the flaming monster to
arrive; all he could do was be patient.

Patience was his strong suit---a remnant from his vagrant days.

Time crawled by. Unseen by Lumian, a charred, flame-tinged monster
entered the path.

After walking over 20 meters, its nose twitched.

It detected the faint scent of blood.

The monster didn't immediately turn. As it continued, it surreptitiously
scanned the source of the smell.

Passing the collapsed wall, the bloody lamb chops caught its eye.

Tempting food, but the flaming monster resisted its instincts, not
devouring the bait.

It pressed on, slowing its pace.

Soon, an unusual fragrance filled its nostrils.

It instantly deduced the meat was a trap and a Hunter lay in ambush
nearby.

This Hunter seemed different from the one who had previously observed it
while invisible. It lacked sufficient knowledge of Hunters and hadn't
masked its scent beforehand.

Taking a few more steps, the flaming monster used the fragrance and
subtle footprints to pinpoint the enemy hiding on the outer wall of the
building behind the trap.

Feigning ignorance, it increased its distance by another seven to eight
meters.

Suddenly, it whirled around, its scarlet flames rapidly condensing into
a fireball tinged with white.

*Boom!*

With a flick of its right palm, the fireball hurtled towards Lumian's
'ambush' location, collapsing the outer wall and causing the house to
shudder.

Hearing the explosion from a distance, Lumian abandoned his hiding spot,
darting into the clearing, his movements a wild, distorted dance.

The explosion was like a signal flare, a stark reminder for him to
swiftly ready the second phase of the trap.

Lumian and Aurore had devised this intricate plan, luring their prey
into sending out their own signal flares.

In the midst of his mesmerizing dance, Lumian detected the hazy forms of
the mouth-orifice monster, the shotgun monster, and the skinless
monster.

By then, the flaming monster had already approached the collapsed wall,
searching for any trace of its enemy.

Lumian danced for another ten to twenty seconds, his movements growing
more intense. He drew out the ritual silver dagger with his right hand,
making a small incision on his left wrist.

A single drop of blood emerged, congealing into a tiny sphere.

Lumian stepped forward, pivoted, and snatched up the blood droplet,
aiming it at the mouth-orifice monster.

"I!"

He uttered the word in ancient Hermes, his voice barely above a whisper.

At that moment, the flaming monster had discovered the faint footprints
Lumian had left behind. Catching a whiff of a subtle scent, it started
tracking him.

Quickly shouting his follow-up command, Lumian watched as the
mouth-orifice monster swallowed the blood droplet from the tip of the
silver dagger and entered his body.

A wave of madness, bloodlust, cruel intent, and ravenous hunger washed
over him.

Lumian fought back the discomfort, hastily bandaging his insignificant
wound with a white strip he'd brought along.

Next, he popped a piece of cheese into his mouth, chewing and swallowing
to make sure the residual gray amber scent on his body would mask any
other mingled odors.

Throughout this process, Lumian sprinted to the edge of the road and
halted at an inconspicuous spot.

He clenched his jaw tight and spun around, carefully retracing his steps
along his previous path.

Relying on a Hunter's observation skills and Dancer's exaggerated
flexibility, Lumian made sure to leave only faint footprints and no
additional marks.

It wasn't long before he reached the center of the road and stopped.

Maintaining his invisibility, Lumian remained in plain sight on the
road.

He waited, using shallow Cogitation and constant suspension to suppress
any thoughts of attacking the flaming monster, a rudimentary way to
disrupt its danger premonition.

His inspiration came from a Hunter's keen self-awareness.

Aurore had once written about the tactic of retracing one's footsteps to
lie in ambush mid-road in a novel.

After seven or eight seconds, the flaming monster's pitch-black form
appeared in Lumian's sight. Utilizing his uncanny flexibility, he
twisted his body to observe the approaching target.

The flaming monster followed the faint footprints and scent left behind
by its enemy. Uninterrupted, it continued its pursuit.

Once back on the main road, it sniffed the air, unsurprised to detect a
mild fragrance.

It instinctively lowered its head and found the inconspicuous
footprints.

But it found no trace of traps in the vicinity.

Without hesitation, the flaming monster tracked the footprints to the
other side of the road.

The charred face and displaced eyeballs loomed larger and clearer in
Lumian's sight.

Holding his breath, Lumian didn't disrupt his Cogitation again, striving
to empty his mind.

Five meters, three meters, one meter... He lunged at the target, raising
the Fallen Mercury in his left hand for a swift slash!

He didn't wait to close the gap further, fearing that it would trigger
the prey's danger sense and prompt evasive maneuvers.

The flaming monster suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of danger.

Without thinking, it leaped to the side.

Simultaneously, its vision captured Lumian's figure, attacking with a
pewter-black dirk in his bandaged left hand.

They were so close that despite the flaming monster's reaction, evasion
was impossible. Lumian collided with it.

With a tearing sound, Fallen Mercury's sharp blade sank into the flaming
monster's right chest.

The fate extracted from Noodle Man infiltrated the target's body as an
illusory mercury bead.

Meanwhile, a river of countless intricate mercury symbols briefly
surfaced. Some of the destinies rapidly converged towards the
pewter-black blade.

Lumian didn't bother selecting the destiny to exchange, letting Fallen
Mercury do as it wished.

*Boom!*

The monster's flames erupted.

The forceful shockwave hurled Lumian and his Fallen Mercury away.
Crimson flames ignited his clothes and scorched his facial skin.

Lumian bore the searing pain, twisting his waist midair to alter his
trajectory.

As soon as he landed, he sprang to his feet and fled.

However, unable to re-enter the Invisibility state until the flames were
extinguished, he remained visible.

*Boom!*

Despite his serpentine sprint, Lumian was still knocked off his feet by
the fireball's aftershock. His back throbbed with numbing pain.

He struggled to his feet, scrambling away from the path and into the
ruins where he had been hiding before.

The flaming monster pursued Lumian, who was unable to turn invisible
once more.
