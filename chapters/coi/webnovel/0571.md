## Chapter 571: Key Details

The Governor of the Sea's residence hall opened into a labyrinth of
rooms, its scarcity of windows allowing only a trickle of light despite
the crimson moon's glow. The dimness cast a cloak of silence over the
place.

Even as the deputy host, clutching the coveted Ring of the Sea Queen,
moved with caution, the floor still betrayed him with a faint echo.

Lumian observed him heading towards the basement staircase, a sudden
realization dawning upon him.

Once in the basement, the deputy host could effortlessly switch the
authentic Ring of the Sea Queen with a crafted counterfeit without
alerting anyone.

The other deputies were occupied in the hall, and the Governor of the
Sea, undergoing physical modifications, had the Maidens of the Sea by
his side. The sea spawn were scattered elsewhere.

Frowning, Lumian shot a sidelong glance at another deputy host. He
lowered his voice and addressed Jorge, the form Juan Oro had taken, in
Intisian.

"Every year, during the vigil ritual, does a deputy host send the Ring
of the Sea Queen alone to the basement, retrieving it an hour later?"

He stressed the word "alone."

Juan Oro nodded subtly.

"Yes. There's no need for extra protection in this building..."

But just as Juan Oro was about to continue, he halted abruptly.

This presented a golden opportunity to swap the Ring of the Sea Queen
unnoticed.

The fact that external enemies couldn't breach the building didn't mean
the deputy hosts within were without their own problems!

Lumian wasted no time and turned to Juan Oro, uttering, "Should I
follow, or will you take charge?"

Juan Oro regarded the matter gravely, rising from his seat and
responding, "I'll go."

Harnessing his abilities, he steadied himself and swiftly caught up with
the deputy host. In a deep tone, he stated, "Let's go together. I want
to seize the chance to pay my respects to my ancestors."

The other deputy host raised no objections.

As Lumian observed the two lighting their lanterns and descending into
the basement, his mind instinctively filled in the upcoming sequence.

*Place the Ring of the Sea Queen on the decrepit stone platform... Offer
prayers to the ancestors... Return to the surface... Re-enter and
retrieve it an hour later...*

*During that hour, the Ring of the Sea Queen sits unguarded in the
basement, vulnerable to any opportunistic interference... If someone had
concealed themselves there beforehand, swapping the genuine ring for a
counterfeit would be a straightforward task...*

*Certainly, infiltrating and concealing oneself in this location is no
simple feat. I can't even do it; I could last a mere two minutes before
being detected by the sea spawn...*

*The Ring of the Sea Queen has to be positioned on that worn stone
platform. Any deviations---deviations...*

With these thoughts swirling in his mind, Lumian suddenly recalled the
transformations in the Lie earring when it rested on the weathered stone
platform in the basement.

*The Seer pathway item had activated a pattern embodying an Apprentice
and a Marauder, granting it the ability to siphon someone's power that
lasted half a month!*

*Lie could accomplish this feat, but what about the Ring of the Sea
Queen?*

*Though not an item of the Seer, Apprentice, or Marauder pathway, it had
been meticulously crafted based on a ritual passed down by an Amon.
Perhaps, over time, it could activate the unique characteristics of the
basement, gradually assimilating with thieving qualities.*

*Yes! Considering that the essence of the sea sacrificial ritual
involves extracting power from the seal at the bottom of the sea and
claiming it, the Ring of the Sea Queen, being a key item, should not
only be capable of loosening the seal to a certain extent but also
possess the power-stealing ability. It could distribute the gains among
various participants in the ritual---the host receiving the most,
followed by the Maidens of the Sea as assistant hosts, and the deputy
hosts and sailors gaining some within the ritual's range, provided they
possessed similar powers!*

*In essence, Juan Oro and his companions' understanding of the
ring-making ritual is incomplete. The "paying homage to the ancestors"
segment is integral and crucial. Without honoring the ancestors, the sea
sacrificial ritual would merely open the seal without stealing the
accumulated power. Instead, it would erupt and disperse...*
Lumian had just marveled at the mysticism's terrifying complexity when a
sudden alarm gripped him.

He realized he had overlooked a pivotal detail.

According to Madam Magician's interpretation of the Ring of the Sea
Queen's functions and her speculations about the essence of the entire
sea prayer ritual, the substitution of the genuine Ring of the Sea Queen
with the fake ring customized by April Fool's in Torres should have
prevented the catastrophic phenomenon of the sea's fury consuming the
Governor of the Sea, all the deputy hosts, and some sailors in the
subsequent ritual!

The fake ring hadn't undergone the initial ring-making ritual, leaving
its patterns, symbols, and structure devoid of the necessary mysticism
characteristics. Even if the Governor of the Sea recited the prescribed
words, he couldn't infuse energy into it to open the seal!

As a complete counterfeit, it shouldn't have triggered any phenomena.
However, due to its incapacity to extract the amassed power, the sea
area would experience more shipwrecks, and the weather would
deteriorate.

To align with the events of the previous year, the fake ring thrown by
the Governor of the Sea had to complete the first part of the
ring-making ritual. Still, without being placed in the basement to honor
the ancestor, it could only partially open the seal, unable to extract
and monopolize the gathered power. This incomplete process led to a
sudden eruption, causing the sea to "rage"!

Lumian's eyes narrowed slightly. As a Conspirer, he had seized the core
of the matter.

Two Rings of the Sea Queen were on the ship, but both were fakes.

The ring brought by the deputy host to the ritual ship was also a
forgery. In fact, the authentic Ring of the Sea Queen hadn't made an
appearance during last year's sea prayer ritual!

The genuine Ring of the Sea Queen, which had undergone the entire
ring-making ritual as per the Fisheries Guild's knowledge, hadn't been
placed on the stone platform in the basement to fulfill the ritual of
honoring the ancestors. Consequently, it was also a sham---a counterfeit
ring lacking the most crucial effect!

The deputy host who had taken the Ring of the Sea Queen into the
basement and retrieved it last year might also be part of the problem!

The peripheral members affiliated with April Fool's weren't considered
trustworthy. Their actions likely didn't disrupt the overall plan. The
fake ring concealed in the lamb's stomach and the Bard's performance
likely served as preparations for subsequent investigations,
camouflaging vital clues. As Lumian's thoughts raced, Juan Oro and the
deputy host returned to the hall.

"It's on the stone platform," whispered the president of the Fisheries
Guild, masquerading as Jorge, to Lumian.

Lumian refocused his attention and casually inquired, "Who was
responsible for sending the Ring of the Sea Queen to the basement last
year?"

"I don't know. Without any special arrangements, anyone can do it. The
four deputy hosts in the hall last year died in the sea's rage when the
ritual failed." Juan Oro, sensing Lumian's suspicion, clarified.

*Dead? Unlikely...* Lumian lacked the corresponding item for
spirit channeling and didn't have time to search for it. All he could do
was ask, "Which one of them was familiar with the ring-making ritual and
knows the details of the Ring of the Sea Queen?"

"None of them; it was their first time serving as deputy hosts." Juan
Oro shook his head. "Besides, as I said, those who know these secrets
are still alive."

*If the deputy host wasn't Ultraman... Then who was it?*
Lumian's mind raced as he arrived at a conclusion.

It was Mad Lady!

Similar to Bard, she utilized the same technique to alter her
appearance. With Ultraman's assistance, she assumed the guise of a
deputy host, completing the final step in creating the Ring of the Sea
Queen. Then, she boarded the ceremonial ship with it.

Lumian had been puzzled by how Mad Lady could locate the special sea and
rescue Bard accurately and in time. Now, he had the answer.

Mad Lady was present on the ceremonial ship, right beside Bard. There
was no need for coordinated locations or timing!

Initially suspecting Mad Lady to collaborate with Bard, Lumian now
realized that Bard worked with Mad Lady, providing assistance in case of
unexpected developments and shouldering the responsibility of misleading
investigations.

*Dammit, Faceless abilities are so annoying. April Fool's is so
annoying!* Lumian's emotions fluctuated as he struggled to
contain his emotions as he cursed. Relying on his Ascetic trait, he
restrained himself from erupting.

More importantly, while he had unraveled the issues with the sea prayer
ritual from last year, the identities of Ultraman and the forthcoming
plans of April Fool's remained elusive.

The night passed in silence.

On an out-of-fashion sailboat in the harbor, Charname, sporting a short,
round-rimmed felt hat, emerged from the cabin and approached Nolfi, who
stood at the edge of the deck. Charname inquired, "Can we enter those
special waters if we set off now?"

Nolfi nodded, responding, "Yes, the stars will align in a specific
pattern after midnight."

Following Lumian's instructions, she and Batna had rented a boat for a
few days from other ports along the same coastline.

Charname chuckled, saying, "Then let's set off!"

Observing the surprised and puzzled expressions of Nolfi and Batna, he
explained, "If we follow the Governor of the Sea's ceremonial ship,
we'll undoubtedly be discovered by the Fisheries Guild. Setting off an
hour or two later would be meaningless. Therefore, we'll go ahead of
time and hide there, patiently waiting for an opportunity!"

Although Nolfi didn't understand the nature of the opportunity Charname
referred to, she didn't inquire. She responded with anticipation,
"Okay."

Charname then turned to Batna.

"Are you joining us? It will be very dangerous."

Batna's expression fluctuated. After more than ten seconds, he declared,
"I'm going!"

Charname clicked his tongue but remained silent.

At that moment, Nolfi frowned, glancing at other parts of the deck, and
asked, "What about the sailors here? We can't leave the sea without
them, and they can't handle too much danger."

Charname chuckled.

"Don't worry, we have sailors who can handle danger."

As soon as he finished speaking, he half-turned, raising his right hand
to the third level of the cabin. He clasped his index finger and thumb
into a ring and extended his other three fingers.

Soon, the captain, first mate, second mate, and all the sailors emerged,

their eyes tightly shut. Like sleepwalkers, they lined up and walked
down the gangway toward the docks.

Batna and Nolfi's eyes froze, as if trapped in a terrifying dream.
