## Chapter 800: New Waitress

Lumian admitted that he felt a bit provoked.

However, it was still acceptable. If his guess was right, he and Albus
would eventually cross paths again regarding 0-01. It was better for the
Abscessed Hand's head to be in Albus's possession than lost or hidden by
some unknown person.

Lumian now regretted not acting against Albus at the Carnivore Bar. He
had hesitated and wanted to use him.

At that time, it was hard to predict that Albus had already obtained the
Abscessed Hand's head.

Silently, Lumian activated the black mark representing Spirit World
Traversal, sensing the subtle connection between himself and the
Abscessed Hand's body parts again.

He intended to use this to find Albus.

*The feedback is all similar, no way to distinguish which is stronger,
which might be Hand Bro's head... Did Albus do something to suppress the
feedback? Or completely block it?* Lumian slowly exhaled, taking
the Abscessed Hand's ear from the black wooden box and placing it in his
Traveler's Bag.

He carefully examined the area around the grave, hoping to find clues to
Albus's whereabouts.

Unfortunately, Albus was also an experienced Hunter, very adept at
covering his tracks.

Containing his emotions, Lumian turned back to the Carnivore Bar amidst
the dust and clouds from the volcanic eruption.

As he stepped through the door, Lez, the human cook, who had found some
wood to repair the shelves and bar counter, stopped working, hammer in
hand, and turned to him.

"I hired a waitress."

"You can decide on that yourself," Lumian said, uninterested in the
bar's operation. He only cared about getting three meals and free
lodging under the guise of being the boss.

Lez, ever diligent, added, "You know her. Julie, who came in with us."

*The "collector"?* Lumian almost choked on his own saliva.

*Why would a man hire such a "collector" as a waitress?*

*Won't he feel a chill down there?*

Before Lumian could ask Lez's reasoning, Julie descended from upstairs.

She had changed into a dark slit dress she found from somewhere, with
her chest barely concealed under a thin veil.

Her previously dirty face was now clean, and her long brown hair was
simply tied up, her features clear in Lumian's eyes.

Despite having been around two Demonesses for a long time, Lumian found
himself impressed.

This female convict didn't look perverse or mad, with slender brown
eyebrows and brown eyes that seemed to hold a gentle autumn water, her
skin delicate and white, her demeanor gentle and elegant, contrasting
sharply with her enticing figure.

She was a uniquely beautiful woman, exuding an allure beyond normal.

*Like a Demoness...* Lumian had to admit Julie's previous
disguise with dirt and loose hair was quite effective.

*Another case of the Law of Beyonder Characteristics
Convergence...* Lumian sighed, responding to Julie's tender,
affectionate gaze,

"Why do you want to be a waitress at my bar?"

"I need a job to support myself," Julie smiled gently, as if they were
in some city instead of Morora.

Lumian suddenly changed the topic.

"Why do you like collecting that part of men?"

Julie's gentle brown eyes suddenly showed an indescribable madness. She
smiled and answered with a tone of longing, "I just want to reclaim
what's mine."

*Uh... another victim of the Demoness Sect? Now turned perpetrator...
She must have transformed from a man to a woman like Franca, but unlike
Franca, she had severe psychological issues, resulting in her abnormal
hobby?* Lumian guessed while confirming that Julie was likely a
Demoness, and not a low-level one, at least a Sequence 6 Demoness of
Pleasure.

Lumian then murmured, *Your way of digesting Pleasure is to rape men and
then cut it off at the climax to make them experience the fall from
heaven to hell?*

*That fits the nature of a Demoness of Pleasure, but it's too direct and
brutal, lacking the beauty of self-struggle...*

*How did the Church of Knowledge send a Demoness here as an ordinary
rapist-murderer?*

*Was it intentional?*

*Right, based on my current mysticism knowledge, each god's pathway top
has one to three great beings holding all the sequence powers, like Mr.
Fool, The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings, the Great
Mother, and the Mother Tree of Desire...*

*From this perspective, the Primordial Demoness---being adjacent to the
Hunter pathway---trying to scheme 0-01 is understandable, perhaps
inevitable. According to Madam Magician, 0-01 is the key to ascending to
Red Priest and becoming the true god of the Hunter pathway...*

*In this case, once the Demoness Sect discovers Morora, they will
definitely send witches below the demigod level to infiltrate
here...*

*Why didn't they send anyone before, waiting until Julie and I were
exiled together?*

*Perhaps the Primordial Demoness's revelation told them only by
following me could they enter Morora, given I was specially sent by the
Church of Knowledge without any checks?*

*No, more likely, Julie isn't the first or even the second Demoness to
infiltrate Morora. The previous ones didn't complete their mission and
gradually lost contact with the Demoness Sect...*

*If that's true, the Demonesses controlling the mirror world have it
easier than me using the Mirror Cufflink and Mirror Mark to connect with
the outside. Julie must have a lot of accumulated intelligence and
plans...*

*From her, I might find opportunities and ways to approach 0-01 and
leave a mark...*

With these thoughts, Lumian smiled at Julie, who still had a hint of
madness in her eyes, "I don't care what you want to reclaim or why, but
since you chose to be my bar's waitress, you must follow my rules.
First, no harassing customers during business hours."

Julie looked a bit aggrieved but her eyes shone brightly, full of
anticipation.

"What if they harass me?"

"Lez will throw them out. If they dare fight back, Lez knows how to cook
them and will leave you the parts you want," Lumian said casually. "Or
you can wait until the bar closes and find them yourself."

Julie licked her lips. "What's the second rule?"

"No harassing the boss." Lumian headed for the stairs to the second
floor. "Lez will discuss your pay."

Julie seemed slightly disappointed. "I wanted to see if what I lost is
with you."

Before Lumian could respond, she asked again, "Is it harassment if I
invite you to view my collection?"

"Not interested," Lumian replied curtly.

He confirmed Julie's crimes weren't intentional to get exiled to Morora.

She had a genuine hobby, looking gentle and beautiful but twisted and
mad inside.

After dark, Julie finished Lez's meticulously prepared dinner and
praised it, "I've decided to seduce you last."

Her seduction was lethal.

Lez seemed a bit disappointed but sincerely asked, "If you're ever
killed, can I have your body?"

"Sure," Julie agreed nonchalantly, her movements graceful and smile
reserved.

She then looked at Lumian, blinking. "Boss, the bar hasn't reopened. Can
I go out tonight?"

"That's your freedom." Lumian drank some wheat ale to suppress the
sudden restlessness inside him.

He was now sure Julie was a Demoness of Affliction, having just used
Charm on him.

If she approached again, he planned to Cull her without mercy.

Only by intimidating this Demoness of Affliction with strength and
ferocity could he keep her in check.

Julie wiped her mouth with a white napkin, stood up, and left the
Carnivore Bar.

After a few seconds, Lumian vanished from the table.

He first teleported then turned into a shadow creature, silently
following Julie.

Julie walked elegantly, approaching a square where exiles gathered,
feigning drunkenness.

The exiles couldn't take their eyes off this Demoness. A muscular man
eagerly approached and chatted with Julie.

Julie drunkenly waggled her finger.

"I want to duel you."

"Sure," the man said joyfully, helping Julie leave for his home.

The other exiles didn't react in time, losing sight of the two.

Lumian didn't lose track, hiding outside the man's window.

He heard Julie's kitten-like moans, unlike the rough madness he
imagined.

With an Ascetic's endurance, Lumian showed no abnormality until the man
shouted loudly, nearing climax.

The next second, a piercing scream of intense pain erupted from the
room.

Soon, Julie emerged, face flushed, eyes bright, her beauty overwhelming.

She held a bloody object, freezing it in crystal-clear ice, placing it
in a small bag.

Lumian continued following Julie, who didn't attempt any
counter-surveillance, arriving at the large square outside the Knowledge
Cathedral.

She seemed to be waiting for something.

After a while, a team of black-robed enforcers emerged from the church,
led by a tall, fair-skinned, restrained, beautiful woman.

Julie's eyes lit up, her face glowing with joy.

She approached the enforcers excitedly, shouting at the leader,
"Celeste!

The tall woman in the black robe glanced at Julie indifferently, asking
emotionlessly, "Who are you?"

Julie's expression froze.
