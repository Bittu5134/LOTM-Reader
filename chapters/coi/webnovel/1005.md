## Chapter 1005: Investigating Hidden Dangers

Based on the nature of tonight's events, Lumian had made some guesses
and was prepared to see certain dream manifestations, but the person who
appeared at the emergency center was completely unexpected: it was Peng
Deng's co-renter, Grisha!

*The fact that he and Peng Deng are sharing a place did hint at
something unusual about him. We'd even observed him before but never
managed to figure out who he corresponded to in the real world... Could
he be the mastermind behind tonight's events? What is his real
objective?* Lumian's mind raced, his confusion deepening.

He had initially locked in on the individual that the Aurora Order put
their faith into as the one orchestrating everything tonight, hoping to
confirm a few things. But Grisha didn't fit the "I'm watching,
listening, and aware" profile---he was eccentric, paranoid, and rude.

"Him?" Franca, slower to react than usual, leaned over to take a look at
the screen frozen on Lumian's phone.

Her sudden shock made her more animated.

"Unexpected discoveries are still valuable," Lumian said, already calm.

"Yeah," Franca replied, not saying much more.

Lumian wasn't in a rush to leave. He pulled out a cracked makeup mirror
and began focusing intently.

His actions caught Franca's attention. She tilted her head to look at
him, slightly puzzled. "What are you doing?"

"I'm checking if the mirror world has recovered and whether the broken
fragments have formed a new area behind the mirror," Lumian explained
briefly. "Luo Shan didn't bring her phone, and I don't have any other
abilities to contact her. I need to use the mirror world to send her a
message that you're safe and that she can leave the underground area
with Zhou Mingrui.

"There's no urgent matter now, but what if Zhou Mingrui does discover
something?"

Franca was stunned for a moment. "Zhou Mingrui went underground? Won't
that be a problem?"

The basement of Mushu Hospital was a mixture of subconscious
psychological traumas and a symbolic abyss tied to the Mother Tree of
Desire. Even if it couldn't physically endanger Zhou Mingrui, it might
force him to confront past traumas, awakening strong stimuli that could
bring significant changes. Those changes could be either extremely good
or extremely bad, which was why Lumian's team hadn't wanted Zhou Mingrui
to enter Mushu Hospital's basement at this stage.

Lumian glanced at Franca and chuckled. "Plans never keep up with
changes. The most important thing just now was rescuing you. Everything
else can be dealt with later or patched up. If worst comes to worst,
this mission fails completely, and they send in another team. At worst,
we all face the apocalypse. But I couldn't let you die here tonight."

Franca stared at Lumian for a few seconds, unable to find words.

After a moment, she looked away and sighed. "There are some things that
can never be made up for..."

Hearing that sigh and those words, Lumian finally felt like Franca had
come back to life from the deadened state she'd been in earlier.

He didn't ask what she meant, waiting for her to sort out her own
thoughts. He gazed at the cracked mirror in his hands.

"The mirror world has recovered, and the larger mirror fragments have
regained their mystical properties."

With that, Lumian whispered a few words, imbuing them with a flickering,
dark shimmer before sending them into the largest piece of the cracked
mirror.

Mushu Hospital, B2.

Luo Shan led Zhou Mingrui, creeping cautiously along the corridor,
glancing around as she searched for the missing Luo Fu.

Just as she looked toward one of the rooms and Zhou Mingrui gazed in the
opposite direction, she spotted a piece of shattered glass on the
ground. Words flickered across it: "Luo Fu is already home."

*Phew...* Luo Shan quickly turned to Zhou Mingrui and said, "I
got a message. Luo Fu escaped."

Zhou Mingrui studied Luo Shan for a moment but didn't ask how she
received the message.

He'd noticed earlier that she seemed to have rushed out of the house,
forgetting to bring her phone.

After they left Mushu Hospital's basement and Zhou Mingrui sent Luo Shan
back to Dechuang Garden, she saw Lumina and Luo Fu in the entryway.

"You two just got back as well?" Luo Shan blurted out.

Holding two mirror fragments, Lumian glanced around and replied, "We had
to deal with the hospital's surveillance."

Even though tonight's events weren't tied to any criminal case and were
considered a "natural disaster," meaning no police investigation, Lumian
thought it was better to play it safe.

Luo Shan was stunned for a couple of seconds.

*Quite the seasoned criminal, aren't you...*

Lumian then addressed Luo Shan, "Thanks for your help. Without you
bringing Zhou Mingrui to the basement in time, both Luo Fu and I
would've been swallowed by that illusory abyss."

A smile appeared on Luo Shan's face, though she tried to be modest.

"It was Zhou Mingrui who was willing to risk his life to save someone.
He's always been a good person."

"It's impressive that you convinced him so quickly," Lumian said, not
sparing any praise.

"Not really," Luo Shan said, feeling a little uncomfortable as she
looked away.

She walked briskly into the elevator that had just arrived on the first
floor.

After stepping in, Lumian turned to Luo Shan and said, "We'd like to
inspect your apartment, to identify any hidden threats."

"Sure, okay!" Luo Shan remembered how she had inexplicably ended up in
the hospital's basement.

Without uncovering the lurking threat in her room or nearby, she
wouldn't be able to sleep soundly.

When they arrived at Room 1502, Lumian naturally began inspecting every
corner, while Franca, finally recovering her energy, silently touched
various objects.

After a few seconds, Lumian stood in front of the living room's glass
window and spoke to Luo Shan, who was standing near the coffee table.

"I'll perform a Magic Mirror Divination and see if I can get any answers
or hints."

Luo Shan nodded repeatedly.

Lumian reached out toward the transparent glass, which had turned into a
mirror under the night sky, and began chanting the appropriate
incantation.

He was only able to perform Magic Mirror Divination that relied on his
own spirituality.

After posing his question, the surface of the glass rippled with a dark
shimmer.

The shimmer settled, revealing a scene of a parrot with colorful
feathers in a painting.

"That?" Luo Shan quickly turned her head to look at the wall behind her.

*Did my own drawing betray me?*

Almost simultaneously, the colorful parrot flew out of the painting,
attempting to escape from Room 1502.

But the doors and windows were locked, and it repeatedly hit the walls.

"Why?" Luo Shan shouted.

The parrot responded in a crisp, human voice. "I'm not your puppet. I
serve..."

Before it could finish speaking, its body suddenly disintegrated.
Feathers fell one by one, followed by flesh that dripped like melting
paint.

In just two or three seconds, the colorful parrot had turned into
countless droplets of paint, splattering onto the cream-colored tiles.

"It was controlled by someone else," Lumian concluded.

"How is that possible?" Luo Shan was shocked and confused.

*This was something I painted stroke by stroke. How could it be
controlled by someone else?*

*If it was the other version of me reviving within me and secretly
influencing my creation, I could accept that. But an outsider?
How?*

Lumian glanced at Luo Shan.

"Never trust anything completely. That applies to others, things you've
created, and even yourself."

"I understand..." Luo Shan recalled her previous experiences, thinking
of that other version of herself.

Lumian thought for a moment and suggested, "You should stay at our place
tonight, just in case there's another incident."

He planned to take pictures of every item and corner of Luo Shan's
apartment tonight, then send them to Anderson to check for any remaining
issues.

"Okay," Luo Shan quickly agreed.

Regardless of the parrot's situation, she had already planned to pack
her things and find a decent, reasonably priced hotel to stay in for a
few nights.

After settling Luo Shan in Room 2303 with Jenna, Lumian took Franca with
him to Room 1502 to photograph every part of the apartment, making sure
to leave nothing out.

Once he finished, he immediately sent the photos to "A name that leaves
a deep impression on you," ending with the question: "Can you spot any
potential problems in these photos?"

After a few minutes, Anderson Hood replied: "Are you inviting me to play
'Spot the Difference'?"

"Something like that," Lumian responded casually.

He waited patiently until four or five minutes later, receiving another
message from Anderson.

"If it were me, I'd show someone photos with absolutely no problems and
ask them to find something wrong."

*Does that mean... there's nothing wrong?* Lumian thought to
himself.

Anderson Hood sent another message. "That blank spot on the painting is
an eyesore. Add some paint to it."

Lumian nodded thoughtfully before asking: "Can you control things
painted by others?"

"There are many ways to control painted objects. One is to become a
symbol within the painting's world. Another is to give them a more
complete life. A third is to imbue them with humanity. A fourth is to
reconfigure the information they're composed of, given their essence as
information. And lastly, there's the fact that they possess
spirituality---you could turn them into your marionette..." Anderson
uncharacteristically provided a lengthy explanation, finishing with:
"After hearing all that, don't you feel like every possibility you
imagined can't be ruled out?"

"You're giving me so much detail just so I'll say 'yes,' aren't you?"
Lumian replied without emotion.

In his opinion, identifying the hidden danger in the room wasn't the
most important thing. They had already confirmed that Luo Shan was being
watched by some force or enemy. If they didn't root out the other side
and eliminate them, today's hidden danger would be dealt with, but
tomorrow a new one would appear.

Too bad that parrot wasn't put under control and couldn't finish what it
was saying.

Seeing that Anderson Hood hadn't responded again, Lumian stood up and
looked at Franca.

Franca was standing by the window in Luo Shan's apartment, silently
gazing out.

Lumian walked over and stood beside her, looking out in the same
direction.

He saw the food stalls on the street far below, people eating and
drinking late into the night, and the high-rise apartments in the
neighborhood, with lights still on in many rooms, dotting the night sky.

Lumian gazed quietly for a while before turning to look at Franca.

Franca was focused, her gaze seemingly reluctant to shift for even a
second.

After a while, she sighed softly. "The night is truly beautiful..."
