## Chapter 488: Mutual Provocation

*Fire Raven fused with an Affliction disease? Is that even possible?
Will I pull off something similar when I switch to the Hunter pathway?
Is this the merging of different abilities through pathway switching?
It's more unique and bizarre?* As Franca coughed, surprise,
solemnity, and a touch of anticipation painted her expression.

Even though she was compelled to break her invisibility, Franca found
herself in close quarters with the female Anthony. Her left hand rose,
directing the Ring of Punishment, snug around her thumb, at the Mirror
Person.

Yet, Franca refrained from employing Psychic Piercing. It was a
calculated move to confound the target and any hidden foes.

Having observed Lumian's skirmish, Franca suspected that female Anthony
also possessed Mirror Substitution. Psychic Piercing wouldn't yield the
desired effect.

In that case, why not afflict the opponent with a negative state that
wouldn't trigger Mirror Substitution?

Beatrice's Necklace, dangling from Franca's chest, reflected the
engulfing flames, stirring female Anthony's ambitions to life.

Franca had long discerned that these Mirror People harbored resentment
and animosity toward their authentic selves. Their burning desire to
prove themselves was their weakness.

The longing for success served as their greatest vulnerability.

As two coughs reached female Anthony's ears, she, being a Psychiatrist,
mirrored the choice made by her male counterpart.

Unable to evade the ensuing assaults, she swiveled halfway around,
locking eyes with Franca and Jenna, who had already materialized.

Her pupils turned vertical and shifted to a pale-golden hue.

Awe!

Unlike her male counterpart, female Anthony opted for Awe, considering
the presence of two assailants. This ability had the potential to
influence both targets.

The aura of a dragon---the pinnacle of the food chain---swiftly
descended. Franca and Jenna couldn't help but tremble in fear.

One of them found themselves immobilized, while the other sought refuge
behind the nearest grayish-white stone pillar.

Before female Anthony could unleash Awe, Jenna, still coughing, seized
the moment. She flung a half-blood-stained cloak, causing the bone flute
and wooden box to tumble toward the target's feet.

With her other hand, Jenna pulled the trigger of her revolver,
propelling a yellow bullet engulfed in black flames towards female
Anthony.

However, in that critical moment, Awe took effect. Jenna's right hand
quivered, causing the bullet to veer off course.

Amidst the gunfire, the shadowed Mirror Gardner narrowly evaded the
bullet's trajectory.

Swiftly moving, he leaped to the ground, dodging the projectile, and
rolled into another shadow, vanishing from sight.

Unharmed, female Anthony's eyes seemed to blaze with flames. She
abandoned the idea of casting Frenzy on Franca, who succumbed to the
effects of Awe, redirecting her focus to the coughing and moving male
version of herself.

*Thud! Thud! Thud!* She charged forward, determined to prove
herself by defeating the male Anthony.

At that moment, figures materialized behind the frozen Franca and the
fleeing Jenna. They were male Franca and male Jenna, who had previously
concealed themselves with their abilities.

The former aimed his hidden blade at Franca's back and struck with all
his might. The latter fixed a glare at Jenna's back and pulled the
trigger.

With two cracking sounds, Franca and Jenna's bodies shattered like
mirrors, allowing them to escape the effects of Awe. However, their
throats remained irritated. They had no choice but to endure the
discomfort and occasionally cough as they faced off against male Franca
and Jenna.

Lumian's throat itched, and his head, accustomed to enduring high
temperatures, still radiated warmth.

As an Ascetic, this level of illness couldn't challenge his endurance.
He glanced at female Lumian, not far away, and crimson flames enveloped
him, transforming into a fireball that shot forward.

Female Lumian, her face still marked by blood vessels, sneered and
vanished from her spot once more.

Spirit World Traversal again!

Her figure reappeared behind the rapidly moving Anthony, as if she
wouldn't stop until she had vanquished the Psychiatrist.

Just then, the fireball that had just shot out dissipated prematurely,
morphing into a stream of light.

In the stream of light, Lumian's figure flashed as he teleported to
Anthony's side.

He had been feigning an attack, anticipating female Lumian's use of
Spirit World Traversal. He seized the opportunity to closely follow and
block her!

To achieve this, Lumian not only destabilized the fireball's structure
in advance but also utilized Lie's ability to strengthen his control
over flames.

Appearing beside Anthony as swiftly as female Lumian, he promptly raised
his iron-black boxing gloves and unleashed a flurry of chain punches!

Simultaneously, Lumian conjured the desire he longed to witness in his
mind.

The desire to replace a real person!

This desire proved easier to trigger, and its detonation even better!

Having already adorned the Flog boxing gloves, Lumian aspired to exploit
this state, potentially immune to Mirror Substitution, to impact the
target and temporarily incapacitate his "mirror self" in combat.

With a resounding bang, Lumian's left and right punches met the
resistance of female Lumian's raised hand. However, she lacked boxing
gloves, and her forearm bore several bleeding punctures from Flog's
short thorns.

Her eyes brimmed with escalating resentment and malice, as though she
yearned for Lumian's demise in the very next second.

She had entirely forsaken her pursuit of Anthony Reid.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Lumian unleashed a barrage of punches, incessantly
thwarting his mirror self's attempts to employ other abilities.

He persisted in taunting his counterpart.

"Hey, no Flog boxing gloves? Are you so feeble that you can't even
mirror a mystical item below the demigod level?"

On the one hand, Lumian sought an emotional release. On the other, he
aimed to use Provocation to incense his female self, heightening the
likelihood of the Flog boxing gloves triggering the other's desires and
emotions.

Female Lumian didn't hide her anger. Blocking Lumian's punches, she
taunted with Provocation, "Imbecile! If you had detected Aurore's
anomaly earlier, the issue might have been resolved.

"Imbecile! If it were me, I would've undoubtedly handled it better than
you!"

Lumian's mind buzzed. Even as an Ascetic, he found himself affected by
Provocation.

This frustration and guilt had long been buried deep in his heart, one
of the root causes of all his pain.

His eyes turned bloodshot, a blend of embarrassment, anger, and a
compelling urge to self-destruct surged from the depths of his being.

His attacks intensified as he sought to infuse the thought into his
right hand. He wanted to witness the outcome if he unleashed the Blood
Emperor's aura here in the mirror's Fourth Epoch Trier.

When the time came, everyone present---Voisin Sanson and the other gods
bestowed from different regions---would meet their demise together!

Just then, Lumian's thoughts abruptly cleared. His emotions and impulses
felt as though caressed by a gentle breeze. The melodious melody his
sister Aurore used to hum seemed to echo in his ears, swiftly calming
him.

"Placate!"

Psychiatrist Anthony Reid's Placate.

Seizing the opportunity while Lumian relentlessly pounded female Lumian
with punches, Anthony distanced himself. As he eluded the pursuit of his
female self, he circled back to Lumian's vicinity. Sensing his
companion's volatile mood, he promptly cast Placate.

Affected by Beatrice's Necklace, female Anthony only had eyes for her
true self, indifferent to the fate of female Lumian.

Suppressing the urge to self-destruct, Lumian witnessed female Lumian
teetering on the verge of collapse under his relentless onslaught, her
expression contorted. Franca and Jenna's coughing intensified, hindering
the use of their abilities. Their male counterparts seized the moment,
forcing them to employ Mirror Substitution once again.

Franca was still okay, but Jenna likely had only one Mirror Substitution
remaining.

Observing this, Lumian, his forehead ablaze, felt a mix of concern,
nervousness, and confusion.

Where was Mirror Gardner?

In such a chaotic scenario, any attack---whether directed at Franca,
Jenna, himself, or Anthony---would prove highly effective. He might even
succeed in eliminating them one by one. After all, he was a Reaper.

Yet, Mirror Gardner refrained from attacking. Only the echoing, mocking
laughter signaled his continued presence. He persisted in persuading
Lumian and the others to surrender the black figurine and cease
resisting.

"Hmph!"

Seizing the opportunity when Lumian's assault momentarily slowed, female
Lumian, pushed to her limits, invoked the Spell of Harrumph.

Two beams of white light struck Lumian's body. His vision darkened, and
he experienced the same sensation as his previous adversaries.

*Crack!*

A mirror shattered on Franca's body, and Lumian materialized beside her.

As Lumian's thoughts returned, a flurry of ideas raced through his mind.

*After spreading the disease with the sick ravens, Mirror Gardner
refrained from employing any other offensive abilities. Instead, he
chose to hide in the shadows or conceal himself...*

*Wait, it didn't begin with the disease spread by the sick ravens. It
began with the emergence of male Franca and the other Mirror
People...*

*Why didn't he attack?*

*Considering my mirror self's lack of the Flog boxing gloves, she
probably doesn't possess the Blood Emperor's aura, Mr. Fool's seal, or
Termiboros... The Flog boxing gloves were crafted from the branch of the
Tree of Shadow...*

*The mirror world, despite its apparent danger and terror, shouldn't be
incapable of mirroring the Flog boxing gloves...*

Suddenly, Lumian had an epiphany.

These four Mirror People weren't naturally formed in the mirror's Fourth
Epoch Trier. Mirror Gardner Martin had utilized his unique connection to
this place to create them!

It was akin to an ability!

Mirror Gardner's decision not to attack stemmed from his concerted
effort to sustain the four Mirror People. He couldn't engage in direct
assault; his only recourse was to conceal himself and use words to
interfere with the enemy, disrupting their combat will!

As these realizations coursed through his mind, Lumian couldn't help but
smile.

Dodging male Franca's attack and anticipating the teleportation of
female Lumian, he retrieved the Eye of Truth obtained from Bouvard.
Lumian then adorned the peculiar monocle, seemingly fashioned from flesh
and blood.

It had the ability to pierce through illusions, perceive reality, and
discern the light of spirituality!
