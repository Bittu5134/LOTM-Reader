## Chapter 1092: Just Wishing to Save Humanity

Madam Magician forcibly changed the topic. "If the apocalypse truly
arrives in 1368 as predicted, I won't need to rush my advancement. In a
few years, Mr. Fool should be completely awake, then unlock the seal on
the Western Continent, allowing more Above the Sequences to be born. At
that time, even if we're still at a disadvantage when the apocalypse
arrives, we'll at least have the power to protect ourselves.

"Without the Uncertain Mist mediating, those Outer Deities won't be able
to cooperate well, and they must guard against becoming other Outer
Deities' prey after being wounded.

"Unfortunately, there's not much time left. I can only quickly advance
to Sequence 1. As a Sequence 1 Angel of the Door pathway, my chances of
survival during the apocalypse will be much higher than other pathways.
After all, those Outer Deities probably haven't set Their target on
Sefirah Castle---do They want self-destruction to happen even faster?"

Her thoughts were similar to Lumian's, believing that Sefirah Castle and
its three subordinate pathways were most likely not the Outer Deities'
targets. Even if she became a Sequence 1 Key of Stars, she wouldn't be
specifically targeted.

Lumian detected the insincerity in Madam Magician's words.

*No matter what, if purely for self-preservation and protecting the
closest few people, a Sequence 2 Planeswalker would definitely be better
than a Sequence 1 Key of Stars, less likely to be noticed, able to sneak
away during the chaos.*

*Choosing to quickly digest the potion and advance to Sequence 1 is to
do more during the apocalypse?* The Chariot Lumian could vaguely
grasp that mentality and thought.

At this moment, the Fool shrouded in gray fog said to Madam Magician
Fors, "The Key of Stars will also become a target.

"Before I fully awaken, if the apocalypse arrives, no Outer Deity will
want to see a Lord of Mysteries truly born. They will seal the sefirah,
take away the corresponding Uniquenesses and Sequence 1 Beyonder
characteristics, eliminating the possibility of the spirit world's lord
returning.

"Although They can't further accommodate Sefirah Castle, occupying one
or two Uniquenesses and the corresponding Sequence 1 Beyonder
characteristics is not a problem. Their power will increase slightly,
and Their abilities will become more diverse.

"Besides, just because They can't accommodate Sefirah Castle doesn't
mean there's no suitable way for Them to use it."

Madam Magician fell silent.

She didn't say she would reconsider, nor did she immediately state her
position of becoming an Archangel before the apocalypse.

Lumian was thinking about something else.

*Even if only one or two years remains before the apocalypse, with the
Major Arcana card holders' efforts and Mr. Fool's current awakening
speed, by then, even if he hasn't fully awakened, it shouldn't be far
off. As long as he doesn't actively prevent the Outer Deities' invasion,
those Outer Deities would probably not intentionally provoke
him.*

*But, he is clearly preparing to confront the apocalypse...*

The Chariot Lumian glanced at Mr. Fool at the head of the bronze long
table and asked no further questions.

†

Trier, inside the luxurious villa.

Lumian, lying in the armchair, opened his eyes.

He reached out and touched his blood-red long hair, preparing to cut it
short, but after thinking, he abandoned that plan.

Lumian stood up and paced the room, his mind filled with knowledge
obtained above the gray fog.

He now understood that his goal of becoming a Sequence 0 true god and
attempting to accommodate the City of Calamity was not only necessary
for Aurore's resurrection but also a requirement to transcend Sequences
and face the apocalypse.

*Just one or two years to digest the Weather Warlock potion, become a
Sequence 1 Archangel, then digest the corresponding Sequence 1 potion,
find a way to defeat Red Angel Medici, perform the apotheosis ritual,
and finally suppress the City of Calamity's consciousness to accommodate
it, and possibly contest with the Primordial Demoness in
between...*

*Isn't this timeline too pressing?*

*If luck is bad, I might not even complete the first step of digesting
the Weather Warlock potion...*

Lumian merely imagined the upcoming tasks and felt his scalp go numb,
believing there was almost no hope of success.

Not to mention whether those steps could succeed, there simply wasn't
enough time!

Digesting a demigod level potion itself required a very long time.
Lumian's previous rapid digestion of the Despair and Unaging potions was
due to two factors: first, the deity worshiped by the Aurora Order had
actively exposed Himself, converting all previous arrangements into
"despair; second, leveraging Aurore's special status as a transmigrator
from the past, with her soul fragments maintaining a certain activity,
sealed inside him---an arrangement by the deity worshiped by the Aurora
Order.

Now, Lumian couldn't see any opportunity for quickly digesting the
Weather Warlock potion, and that deity seemed to have made no
arrangements in this regard.

As an Angel of the Hunter pathway, Lumian already possessed steel-like
willpower and fire-like courage. He quickly suppressed his instinctive
retreat and fear, first considering the first step of digesting the
Weather Warlock potion.

*Based on my previous experience, there are two main approaches to
quickly digest a potion: first, through special encounters that adjust
one's mental and spiritual state to closely align with the potion's true
meaning; second, by using a higher-level Beyonder as the object of
acting, obtaining better digestion speed.*

*The first approach is no longer possible... Those higher than my level
are Archangels, true gods, and great existences, and a Weather Warlock
isn't meant to be acted out by people... Ask Them to be spectators,
observing me change the weather and provide feedback?*

*Taking it a step further, change the weather in a true god's divine
kingdom? At the next gathering, seek Mr. Fool's consent to add special
effects to the Major Arcana's discussion, change the weather in Sefirah
Castle?*

*I wonder if this would be effective... I'll seek Mr. Fool's guidance
during the next prayer...*

Lumian, with his initial thoughts taking shape, suddenly smiled
self-deprecatingly.

There was a method that could help him digest the Weather Warlock potion
in the shortest time possible.

Let Blood Emperor Alista Tudor resurrect within him, after which he
would no longer need to digest other potions.

The only problem was that he would die, and Aurore would not be
resurrected.

*I wonder what arrangements Alista Tudor has made, if there's a way to
use these arrangements to quickly digest the Weather Warlock
potion?* Lumian thought for a while but found no insights.

He then considered Madam Magician's suggestion.

*Strengthen humanity, resist godhood, distinguish between normal and
abnormal emotions, desires, and behaviors...*

*Anchors bring others' perceptions, and everyone's perception of me
differs from my true self to some extent. This is also a form of
corruption that can easily make my thoughts, spirit, and humanity
chaotic, but it can be used to balance and resist godhood, giving my
true self and humanity a chance to breathe...*

*If these are normal emotional responses that would arise from one's own
humanity, even if overlapping with godhood, they don't need to be too
suppressed and can be expressed normally?*

*Is this a kind of fusion?*

*Mr. Fool said in the dream city to both resist and merge... At the
Angel stage, fusion is superficial, not obvious, mainly about resistance
and suppression?*

Lumian examined himself, sorting through different emotions and desires.

After a while, he roughly knew what he could do, to what extent, what
must be strictly controlled, and what signs required immediate
restraint.

Of course, having just advanced and not yet adapted to the potion, his
state was unstable. Many things he could do now might be difficult to
control, potentially being driven by godhood into terrible developments.
So, he needed to initially digest the potion.

Thinking this, Lumian immediately used the Hunter pathway's Mental
Communication to speak to Franca, Jenna, Ludwig, and Anthony, who had
not yet left the 10-kilometer range.

*"After becoming a Weather Warlock, Alista Tudor's arrangements might
start to manifest. You must be more vigilant and attentive, especially
regarding matters involving the Demoness Sect."*

Mental Communication would not transmit all inner thoughts or fleeting
ideas to companions; there must be an intention to "speak out" for the
information to resonate in everyone's minds. If Lumian were to share a
Manipulator's Beyonder powers and attach it to Mental Communication, he
could achieve a weakened version of the Hall of Truth effect.

After speaking, Lumian took out a mirror to divine which region was
experiencing extreme weather.

After obtaining the answer, he was about to teleport there.

Before activating the black mark on his right shoulder, he suddenly had
a new idea.

*Some ways to maintain and strengthen humanity can be done right
now!*

A wind rose, blowing open the bedroom window.

Then, Lumian sensed the spirit world coordinates of the target area
while picking up the coat rack in the room and suddenly hurling it
toward the sky.

The coat rack quickly ignited with a purplish-blue flame, speedily
racing toward the horizon.

Lumian leaped lightly, jumping out the window and landing precisely on
the burning coat rack.

Then, with his feet slightly apart and hands clasped behind his back,
his coat fluttering, he rode the flame-engulfed coat rack, which was now
faster than the speed of sound and still accelerating, toward the target
area.

In the second-floor studio, Franca, momentarily distracted from her
creation by Lumian's warning, heard a booming sound from high in the
sky.

Wearing the Face of the Arcane, she stepped to the window and looked at
the azure sky, just in time to see Lumian standing on a flaming "great
sword", hands behind his back, rapidly disappearing from her field of
view, leaving behind a new sonic boom.

Franca's expression revealed envy.

At the same time, she quietly sighed in relief.

In the first-floor papal office, Jenna had been worried about the
negative effects of Franca's fully automatic healing machine---which
would make every healed person, upon recovery, filled with a desire to
reproduce and want to have a child.

Her solution was to have padres and bishops treat common illnesses, pray
to the great God of Disease for serious conditions, and subsequently,
for those with families and partners, have the Sick Church handle the
economic losses from childbirth. For those without partners, consider
matchmaking, and if that failed, have Anthony handle it---making them
feel that it was completely fine having had a child!

Hearing the sonic boom, she also came to the window, looking outside and
seeing Lumian traveling in his peculiar and arrogant manner.

Jenna's face gradually broke into a smile.

She felt Lumian's state had improved somewhat.
