## Chapter 849: Intercontinental Travel

Ludwig had finished eating the red fish hot beef pie in his hand. He
squatted in front of a street bench, took out a pen and a notebook from
his red hard book bag, and began writing his post-meal impressions with
focus and seriousness.

Watching in the shadows, Lumian pursed his lips.

*You say you're afraid, but your body instinctively repeats the habits
formed in the Church of Knowledge...*

*If there weren't so many exams and studies, you might have become a
qualified believer of the God of Knowledge and Wisdom...*

While mocking Ludwig, Lumian surveyed the surrounding citizens.

His gaze passed over a young man quietly reading a book in the café
across the street, over a middle-aged scholar standing at the
intersection observing passersby and carriages without crossing, and
landed on a painter who had set up his easel under an Intis parasol
tree, blankly painting the street scene.

Lumian left the shadows, walked a few steps, and came to stand behind
the painter, peering at his work like the previous passersby.

The painting was ordinary, and he didn't detect any supernatural powers.

Lumian continued walking, inwardly sighing, *It seems to be a normal
painter for now, just with a somewhat off mental state...*

*Is this what Trier's painters are like? Sometimes they seem more like
heretics than actual heretics...*

*Sigh, in Trier, it's too difficult to identify heretics based on
behavioral abnormalities. As Franca would say, many citizens' mental
states are quite beautiful... In this matter, Fourth Epoch Trier and the
overall seal are half responsible, and they themselves are responsible
for the other half...*

As Lumian was thinking, he saw a completely naked man walking towards
him, with the only piece of cloth on him being a black top hat
positioned in front of his lower abdomen.

This man walked with his head held high, looking around proudly, not at
all embarrassed by his current appearance, as if he had done something
very worthy of pride.

After passing Lumian by seven or eight meters, his palm was suddenly
scalded.

He instinctively withdrew his hand and saw that his black top hat had
burst into bright red flames, slowly falling to the ground.

He lost his last piece of cover.

Lumian, his back to him as he continued forward, silently moved his
lips.

*You're welcome, just letting you show off more thoroughly.*

*You dare to streak with just that little bit? Next time, I'll send you
to the New City of Silver for a free tour.*

Lumian walked on with his hands in his pockets, stepping into the
shadows, and turned his attention back to Ludwig.

He had been following for a long time but still hadn't found anyone
suspicious of being a Devouring Whirlpool believer.

However, considering that since knowing Ludwig, the little boy had never
converged with heretics of the same pathway, Lumian suspected that the
seal on him must have some restrictions on this. Otherwise, with an evil
deity's Angel running around everywhere, who knows how many mystical
disasters would have been triggered by now.

*There might be another reason. Many evil deities' bestowed, even if
they've gained godhood, can disguise themselves as normal humans as long
as they haven't lost control or gone half-mad. But those of the
Devouring Whirlpool might not be able to. Ludwig, not yet recovered to
Depriver, can already eat so much in one meal. The corresponding
Sequence 4 demigod, even without letting loose their appetite, would
surely have an eating capacity that would alarm the Purifiers and
Machinery Hivemind...*

*Forget it, the main purpose is to 'tame' Ludwig anyway. Fishing out
other believers of the Devouring Whirlpool is just an additional idea.
It doesn't matter if I don't find any...* Lumian had been
watching for so long but hadn't found any citizens with problematic
eating behaviors.

*†*

After receiving Franca's second letter, Lumian arrived at Apartment 702,
9 Rue Orosai after dinner.

Jenna had arrived two or three minutes earlier, still wearing Vampire
makeup and dressed in an old-fashioned, conservative black robe.

Lumian glanced at Jenna, opened his mouth, then closed it again.

Seeing this, Jenna immediately raised her chin slightly and said, "Were
you going to mock my current appearance?"

Lumian chuckled and said, "I just recalled a joke. Once there was a duke
who, in order to whiten his skin, followed the advice of a quack doctor
and took arsenic-containing pills for a long time. He did successfully
improve his complexion, but he also experienced a side effect---he
died."

"Where did you read that joke?" Jenna asked curiously.

"In Ghost Face. Not long before I saw that joke, a guest at the Auberge
du Coq Doré told me you can make your face look rosy and healthy by
slapping your cheeks, to help find a job more easily." Lumian laughed.
"You coarse-haired folks need to read more books and magazines. Don't be
illiterate, or you'll be looked down upon by the clergy of the Church of
Knowledge."

*I just wanted you to act normal and wait for an opportunity, not keep
mocking...* Jenna suddenly felt an urge to grind her teeth.

"Do you think I'm like you? Having not even finished compulsory
education..."

At this point, Jenna trailed off.

Meanwhile, Franca, who had been furtively writing something at the
coffee table, stood up and said, "You two, don't lose sight of the
important matters."

Lumian, who already knew from the second letter about Harrison the
visitor from Resurrection Island reappearing and Franca wanting to
quickly take Amandina to the edge of the Samaritan Women's Spring area,
nodded gently and said, "My condition has basically recovered."

"That was fast..." Franca was a bit surprised.

Jenna's gaze briefly shifted away before returning to Lumian as she
nodded slightly and said, "Indeed, faster than I expected."

Lumian tsked. "Isn't that a good thing? We can ask Amandina about her
thoughts right now."

"Mm-hmm." Franca excitedly moved to take out the Ice Amulet.

Before coming over, Lumian had already burned the independent space
containing Black Tear for over half an hour. He took out this Grade 1
Sealed Artifact Level 1.

"Let's use this. It won't consume any charges."

As he spoke, his gaze swept across the full-length mirror in the living
room, the glass windows revealing the night, and the metal-surfaced
decorations.

Using Black Tear's mirror magic, he found no abnormalities in these
reflective objects and didn't sense any gazes directed at them from
within.

He then tossed Black Tear to Franca, giving a slight nod to indicate
that the Demoness of Black likely wasn't watching them at the moment.

"I've written down everything I want to tell Amandina to prevent
eavesdropping..." Franca put on Black Tear, held the letter paper in her
hand, covered it with black flames, and pressed it into the glass
surface of the full-length mirror in the living room.

She needed to act quickly and finish this before Black Tear's negative
effects took hold!

†

South Continent, Matani, Port Pylos.

Amandina lit the gas wall lamp and sat at her desk, once again reading
the mysticism materials provided by Ms. Franca.

Each time she read this knowledge, she was genuinely surprised,
respectful, longing, and fearful.

Over the past two to three weeks, she had met with her acquaintances
from the patrol team several times and attended two mystical studies
gatherings. She discovered that the mysticism knowledge recorded in
these materials was actually unknown to the vast majority of Beyonders,
whether official or not.

*This is truly a gift...* Just as Amandina had this thought, she
saw the dressing mirror given to her by Ms. Franca, which she had
specially placed nearby, become dark and ripple with an aqueous light.

Within the aqueous light, Intisian characters were outlined:

"I am Franca. Lumian has returned.

"He asked me to inquire when you plan to come to Trier. He will take you
to the area where that shadow might appear..."

*Louis Berry has returned to Trier...* Amandina thought for a
few seconds, then said to the mirror, "Tonight works."

She had originally planned not to see anyone tonight, to focus on
studying the remaining mysticism knowledge.

She had already instructed her maid in advance and locked her bedroom
door.

As soon as Amandina gave her answer, Franca's slightly urgent voice came
from the mirror.

"Put your hand on the mirror."

Feeling a bit nervous yet quite excited and curious, Amandina reached
her palm towards the surface of the dressing mirror.

She felt the hard, cold glass lose its solid feel, like a layer of water
without temperature.

Amandina's right hand passed completely through the glass surface, and
suddenly a terrifying suction force erupted from within.

Her entire body was yanked in, falling into a dark, empty tunnel,
plummeting towards the end of a vortex.

Before Amandina could react, she felt dizzy and disoriented.

When she regained her senses, she found herself standing in a small
living room, facing Ms. Franca whom she had met before.

This lady was as beautiful as last time, and with the closer distance
and no mirror barrier, her charm was clearly stronger, making even
Amandina, a woman, feel a bit embarrassed to look too much but unable to
resist.

As Amandina's gaze moved, she saw a beautiful woman with pale skin and
bright red lips who looked more girlish, and Lumian Lee sitting in an
armchair, wearing a shirt and jacket, with his right foot crossed over
his left leg.

*Are all the women around this guy so beautiful? He seems to have become
a bit more handsome...* Amandina suddenly felt a little insecure
about her own appearance.

She then looked around, examining this unfamiliar place.

Meanwhile, Franca quickly removed Black Tear and tossed it back to
Lumian.

*How amazing...* Amandina finally came to her senses and asked
with sparkling eyes, "Did I come here through the mirror? Is this
Trier?"

Lumian tucked Black Tear back into that separate space in the Traveler's
Bag and smiled as he corrected,

"It was through the mirror world."

"Mirror world..." Amandina pondered this term, "Then, do I have a way to
travel to different places through the mirror world like you?"

Lumian scoffed. "Don't you know that non-adjacent pathways can't be
interchanged? Don't you know about the existence of mystical items?"

As he spoke, Lumian stood up and walked towards the door. "We're leaving
now."

"Aren't they coming?" Amandina pointed at Franca and Jenna.

She hadn't even had a chance to exchange pleasantries yet!

"No need." Lumian opened the front door.
