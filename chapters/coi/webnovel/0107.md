## Chapter 107: Shattering

*Thump, thump!*

Lumian felt his heartbeat pounding, as images were painstakingly dragged
from the depths of his memories.

His head threatened to split open. He fought against it, unwilling to
continue.

Outside the stained glass, Ryan observed the ritual beginning. He tossed
the Tanago Scarecrow to Leah without hesitation, signaling her to use
the Sealed Artifact against the padre. He hefted the Sword of Dawn.

Beneath the golden flames, Leah and Valentine moved to another stained
glass window, a half-exposed cylindrical wall separating them from Ryan.

They did this to evade the damage from the Hurricane of Light without
hindering their movements. With the cathedral's "defensive capability,"
they believed a barrier between them would suffice. After all, Ryan
would do his best to control the attack's direction.

Leah embraced the Tanago Scarecrow from behind, pressing it against the
stained glass depicting St. Sith's sermon. She aimed at the altar and
Guillaume Bénet, the padre leading the ritual.

On the other side, Ryan gripped the handle with both hands, plunging the
Sword of Dawn into the windowsill.

The two-handed broadsword, forged from pure light, shattered and
transformed into a whirlwind of razor-sharp fragments and specks of
light.

The Hurricane exploded and slammed into the stained glass before him.

With a cracking sound, the entire cathedral trembled. Hairline fractures
spider-webbed across the glass surface.

But it held fast.

Seeing this, Ryan summoned the minuscule particles of Sunrise Gleam,
forging a massive two-handed axe.

Unable to use Hurricane of Light for now, he switched weapons.

Leah and Valentine, shielded by the protruding wall, dodged the
Hurricane of Light's remnants. At that moment, the Tanago Scarecrow's
gaze locked onto the priest. Its eyes, set in the brownish-green straw,
reflected the white-robed figure with golden threads.

Leah noticed a faint silver light tinged with black materialize around
the altar where Guillaume Bénet stood.

With a snap, the Tanago Scarecrow's eyes burst open, weeping blood-red
tears.

The padre glanced over before looking away.

As two sheep "willingly" entered the altar, he intoned the incantation
with calm fanaticism.

"You are the eternal cycle, the predestined destiny, the cause, the
effect, and the process!"

Suddenly, the two deity-representing candles on the altar elongated to
the size of a human head.

A howling wind swept through the cathedral, turning the villagers to
statues. But silver-black warts emerged from their exposed faces and
hands.

The silver-black light enveloping the altar rapidly spread, engulfing
the entire cathedral.

The mural-filled dome became transparent. Clouds dispersed, and the
crimson moon darkened to the shade of blood.

The stars on the black velvet backdrop flickered into existence, one by
one, glowing with the intensity of the sun.

In an instant, night became day. The villagers stirred and murmured
dreamily.

"The horoscope has changed..."

"Fortune is here..."

With three thuds, Ryan, Leah, and Valentine, who hadn't heard but had
witnessed the scene, crumpled to the ground. They writhed, wailed, and
screamed in agony.

Ryan's skin turned grayish-blue, Leah's face appeared to teem with
maggots and pulsing tendrils, and Valentine radiated a sun-like glow,
from inside to out, from top to bottom.

They were on the brink of losing control.

The Tanago Scarecrow lay cast aside, trembling violently.

Lumian felt his chest burn as the terrifying voice, seemingly
originating from an infinite distance and yet right beside him, echoed
in his ears.

Invisible steel drills penetrated his skull, stirring his brain. Blood
vessels bulged in pain, and silvery-black spots emerged beneath his
skin.

An unseen force enveloped him, lifting him from the altar.

The ropes binding him and the cloth gagging him crumbled to dust and
dispersed in the air.

Aurore, too, was hoisted by this invisible force, floating above the
altar and facing Lumian.

His bloodshot eyes mirrored his sister's long blonde hair, vacant
light-blue eyes, pristine and emotionless face, and the simple yet odd
white robe she wore.

He recoiled, sensing a familiar déjà vu from the depths of his memories.
The pain was as intense as the madness.

The surrounding scenes melded together in Lumian's mind:

The padre's solemn and fanatical expression;

The black-robed man advancing toward the altar;

Pierre Berry prostrate on the ground;

The transparent cathedral dome;

The crimson moon and constellations in the sky;

The villagers with stiff expressions, welcoming their fortune;

Aurore, her face contorted with pain...

Lumian's head spun as his body was torn apart by an invisible force,
silver-black spots multiplying on his skin.

He was powerless to break free or resist effectively.

"Ah!"

Lumian screamed involuntarily as his chest was gradually pried open,
casting a silvery-black light onto Aurore.

Aurore's eyes darted around, hearing the agonized cry.

Her empty gaze mirrored Lumian's swollen blood vessels, his twisted face
with silver-black hues beneath the surface.

After a momentary pause, she instinctively reached out and pushed Lumian
away from danger.

*Grande Soeur...* Lumian stared, dumbfounded, as Aurore shoved
him out of the altar's reach.

Suddenly, the dreadful sound in his ears vanished, and the invisible
restraints on his body disappeared. The burning sensation across his
skin subsided.

Yet the pain in his head remained unchanged. Deep-rooted memories were
forcibly dredged up.

It was as if someone had used a hook to slowly extract his brain from
his skull.

Aurore's light-blue eyes tainted with silver-black, her blank stare, her
lifeless face, and her resolute, forceful actions pushing him away
flashed in Lumian's mind. It was nearly identical to what he'd witnessed
moments ago, but the black-robed man was missing from the background.

This amplified déjà vu led Lumian to instinctively question if something
similar had happened before. He screamed in pain once more.

*Bam! *He plummeted to the ground after leaving the altar.

Ignoring the excruciating pain in his head and his disorientation,
Lumian sprang up, prepared to seize Aurore and flee the altar with his
sister.

A figure obstructed his path. The black-robed man wearing his face
struck him on the right cheek, sending him sprawling to the ground.

Lumian refused to give in. With desperate courage, he rose again and
lunged at the black-robed man blocking his way.

*Whack!*

The black-robed man swung his fist, and Lumian instinctively evaded.

He stood stunned for a moment before a twisted smile crept across his
face. He snarled, "Why are you so damn weak? As weak as me!"

Lumian dismissed thoughts of the padre and Pierre Berry as he lunged at
the black-robed man.

The man sidestepped, raising his right foot to trip Lumian's calf.
Lumian didn't evade. With the terrifying flexibility of a dancer, he
forced a half-turn and extended his arm to grapple his foe.

Thud! He tumbled to the ground, taking the black-robed man down with
him.

The man nimbly raised his right hand, gripping Lumian's throat and
delivering a brutal knee to his groin.

Lumian didn't flinch. Bloodshot eyes locked on his opponent, he clawed
at the man's eyes with his right hand.

"Ah!"

The black-robed man screamed as Lumian tore out his eyeballs, blood
spurting forth. Lumian instinctively curled up, nearly passing out from
the agony in his lower body.

Struggling to his feet, he shot the writhing man on the ground a
sinister grin.

"Come on! Let's die together! You coward! Coward!"

He lunged once more, encircling the man's neck with his arms.

At that moment, Pierre Berry, at the edge of the altar, staggered to his
feet. Brandishing his axe, he sprinted to Lumian's side.

*Whack!*

His axe descended, only to be halted by a faint gray mist that had
materialized. It failed to harm Lumian.

Pierre Berry employed two different abilities, but couldn't penetrate
the gray fog's defense.

Guillaume Bénet, the priest, didn't hesitate and began reciting a
prayer.

"I implore you,

"I beseech your benediction.

"I plead with you to grant me..."

Before he could finish, the scene transformed.

The constellations in the sky shifted incrementally, deviating from
their original positions.

Cordu trembled violently as every house and inch of soil surged toward
the cathedral.

Silently, the villagers decomposed into organs. Eyeballs, mouths, noses,
hearts, fingers, and flesh...

A scant few reassembled into different people. Some appeared normal,
others malformed, some missing parts, and some with extra appendages.

The majority hurtled toward the altar and Aurore.

Cracks spread across Aurore's body, and she swiftly disintegrated into
countless pieces of flesh.

Witnessing this, Lumian spiraled into despair.

Still, he refused to surrender. Seizing the black-robed man's head, he
twisted it violently, snapping his neck under the man's horrified gaze.

Lumian rose and raced toward his sister.

But an invisible barrier surrounding Aurore obstructed his path.

*Rumble!*

With a muffled thud, the cathedral began to ascend. Trees, soil, and
boulders from outside the village soared, accompanied by houses,
furniture, and miscellaneous items.

The organs of most villagers merged with Aurore's flesh at the altar,
contorting and writhing before morphing into a colossal being.

The giant stood four to five meters tall, boasting three heads and six
arms. Its entire form was composed of flesh and organ fragments, its
body riddled with cracks oozing yellow pus.

The central head of the giant, filled with pain and regret, strained to
gaze at Lumian.

Transparent, blood-hued tears trickled from the corners of "his" eyes.

Witnessing this, Lumian's mind reeled as if cleaved by an axe.

His vision wavered as he "saw" the shattered cathedral, the steadily
rising blood-red "peak," the thorny "city wall" formed by distorted
houses, the encircling ruins around the "peak," and the various monsters
forced to flee the area...

*What...* Lumian's head throbbed with pain again.

As he watched countless tiny beams of light shoot from the giant and
surrounding monsters, landing on his chest, he realized that the scenes
buried deep in his memories had been entirely unearthed. They were
nearly identical to what he saw now.

*This is...* Lumian abruptly had a hunch, and his headache
worsened.

Suddenly, everything before him turned eerily illusory, with pronounced
cracks appearing like broken glass.

*This is!* Lumian finally recalled something.

Then, he saw the black-robed man transform into a pitch-black, repulsive
liquid that soared before him and seeped into his left chest.

"Ah!"

Lumian screamed in agony as his surroundings crumbled.

He snapped his eyes open and found himself lying beneath the blood-red
mountain peak. The encroaching darkness, signaling the onset of night,
had nearly vanished.

Lumian instinctively sat up, leaning forward. He placed his hands on the
ground and scanned his surroundings.

He saw a twisted, thorny "wall," a barren landscape devoid of
vegetation, and the dream ruins beyond. He spotted Ryan, Leah, and
Valentine lying at the edge of a room not far away.

They were sound asleep.

Lumian abruptly bowed his head, raised his hands, grasped his hair, and
whispered in anguish, "Is reality a dream, and the dream reality? Is
this the present or the past? Aurore. Is Aurore beyond saving?"

"Yes." A woman's voice echoed in the ruins.

Lumian looked up, bewildered, and faintly saw the enigmatic woman appear
before him.

She approached, wearing the orange dress she'd donned at the beginning.

"That's why you were so desperate to obtain superpowers in your dream,
regardless of the consequences. That's why you disregarded others' lives
and even your own. You wanted to resolve the loop embodying the concept
of a 'problem' as quickly as possible. That's why you couldn't control
your instincts and uttered inappropriate words or performed
inappropriate actions on certain occasions..."

Lumian gazed at the mysterious woman, dazed, realizing that the
indescribable and inexplicable emotion in her eyes had resurfaced.

This time, he could finally decipher it.

It was pity.
