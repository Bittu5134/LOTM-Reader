## Chapter 1086: War Machine

Lumian shrugged his shoulders. "This is the result of my best efforts to
compress it."

Of course, if he didn't consider body balance, he could shrink down to
1.9 meters, as he was essentially a Mythical Creature now.

Jenna said with a suppressed smile, "Let's get you changed into some
proper clothes first."

The way he looked now was really awkward, giving the impression of
intentionally wearing undersized clothing to perform as a clown.

After Franca used the mirror world to go to the New City of Silver and
buy clothes suitable for Lumian's current stature, and had him change
into them, the group took their seats.

Franca looked at Lumian's face and muttered, "Oh no, he's too
handsome... I'm starting to feel a bit... flustered."

Jenna did not speak, but her gaze seemed to echo Franca's words. The
experienced Anthony didn't show any obvious reaction.

Lumian leaned back on the sofa. "This change is the result of the
Demoness of Unaging and the Weather Warlock's charms merging.

"A normal Sequence 2 Beyonder in the Hunter path mainly possess a
charisma that makes people want to follow and be loyal to them, and may
cause women to develop feelings of admiration, but there is no active
Charm. Now, it's not just admiration, and not just towards the opposite
sex.

"Hmm, as long as I don't use Charm, it's still somewhat controllable."

"Ooh." Franca looked curious. "What abilities and traits does the
Weather Warlock have?"

Lumian considered carefully before saying, "This Beyonder characteristic
contains Sequence 9 to Sequence 2. The abilities I was missing before,
like the Iron-blooded Knight and the War Bishop, have now been filled.

"I'm always full of courage and won't be significantly affected by
emotions like fear and terror, but I'm not reckless or blind because of
it. In fact, I still feel fear and terror, it's just that my courage
overcomes them."

"The Sword of Courage is the extreme version." Franca nodded in
understanding.

Lumian took out the iron-black longsword from the Traveler's Bag and
tossed it to Franca.

"It's no longer of much use to me. Between you and Jenna, use it if need
be."

Franca caught it and gave a simple "Mm".

Then, as she was putting the Sword of Courage back into the Traveler's
Bag, she stood up and walked towards Lumian and Jenna.

After stowing the Sword of Courage, she suddenly found herself awkwardly
standing in the middle of the living room.

After a brief silence, she chuckled nervously at Lumian. "This sword has
given me the courage to beat you up."

Lumian scoffed, dividing the bundle of longswords used to seal the Sword
of Courage into two parts, and using invisible spider silk to pass one
part to Jenna and one to Franca.

He continued thoughtfully, "I can also galvanize and flame my body.

"At the Sequence 2 level, the former is no longer just ordinary steel,
but closer to the symbolism of 'steel', able to withstand attacks that
would normally destroy or melt real steel. The latter allows me to
disperse into multiple flames, each of which I can control precisely,
then coalesce back into my body. Even if most of the dispersed flames
are extinguished by the enemy, it doesn't affect the integrity of my
physical form, it just weakens my vitality and spirituality
proportionally.

"The Angelic-level flame transformation can also turn me into a stream
of flame, a huge flaming spear, and a terrifying flaming meteor to
attack enemies or travel quickly. Combined with hurricane-like winds, I
can reach speeds over 4,000-5,000 kilometers per hour. And once the
magic potion is fully digested, I can enhance it further.

"The most powerful flames controlled by the Iron-blooded Knight and the
War Bishop are azure, but the Iron-blooded Knight is not pure in this
regard, having a tinge of dazzling white. At the angelic level, the
flames become violet, the Weather Warlock's are a violet-tinged azure to
an azure-tinged violet, the specific hue depending on the digestion of
the potion. In the subsequent Sequence 1, the flames should be a pure
violet.

"Hmm, if I borrow the power of 0-01, the violet will become paler and
more transparent. If I draw on the force from the depths of the ancient
well, the violet will be tinged with a deep red, not the scarlet of a
Pyromaniac, but a blood-red hue.

"My control over the flames has also greatly improved. Compared to
before, I can now cover a battlefield of tens of kilometers, directly
raining down Meteor Shower, or summoning flocks of Fire Ravens.

"The explosive power of compressed fireballs now far surpasses that of a
fleet's main guns... by quite a margin.

"The Iron-blooded Knight can establish a mystical connection with their
team, concentrating the entire group's strength on themselves, and
sharing their teammates' vision, distributing the damage they receive.
However, this concentration only applies to power and spirituality, not
the Beyonder powers of the members.

"At the War Bishop stage, not only can they use the Beyonder powers of
team members within a 3km range, but they can also share their own
abilities and power with them.

"In this regard, a Weather Warlock's range is 10km, and there is no
longer a restriction on sharing abilities. Simply put, while a War
Bishop can only let one member use their ability at a time after sharing
it, a Weather Warlock can allow every team member to use it
simultaneously, lending them the corresponding spirituality. Of course,
the team's overall spirituality doesn't increase.

"From the War Bishop stage onwards, the team's mental resonance becomes
direct telepathy, and the War Bishop can selectively shield and modify
certain information in the communication.

"A War Bishop can also create Fog of War, significantly reducing the
visual range, hearing, and smell of all living beings within, and
enveloping the corresponding spirit world as well, suppressing the
interaction between spirit entities and the spirit world, dulling
spiritual warnings and intuitions.

"At the Weather Warlock level, the Fog of War range initially expands to
20km, continuing to increase as the potion is digested. Additionally,
the Fog of War will also have the ability to interfere with outside
divination and prophecy.

"At even higher levels, it may affect the astral world.

"Within the Fog of War, I am unaffected by anything. This trait can be
shared with team members after becoming a Weather Warlock.

"A War Bishop also has abilities like War Cry and War Song that can be
used to boost the team's morale, temporarily enhance strength, influence
the enemy's mentality, and suppress the target's performance.

"After offering sufficient sacrifices, each War Bishop can petition the
essence of war or the symbolic 'war' for assistance once per battle,
while a Weather Warlock can do so every seven days."

Hearing this, Franca clicked her tongue. "It's practically a war
machine, a scythe reaping lives."

"That's why the true god of this path is titled things like God of War
and 'War Overlord'," Lumian replied with a smile.

He then said, "A Weather Warlock has the partial authority to change
regional weather and create extreme weather conditions, such as
thunderstorms, hurricanes, heavy rain, hail, blizzards, and dense fog. I
call this Weather Manipulation."

"In the Western Continent, it might be called 'to call the wind and
summon the rain'---being completely influential! No, that doesn't cover
it comprehensively enough," Franca said excitedly.

Lumian gave a sound of agreement.

"A Weather Warlock mainly controls the weather, while things like
meteors, tsunamis, and earthquakes are not under our purview, though
some can be indirectly induced, like using a hurricane to trigger a
tsunami.

"My Weakness Investigation has also been enhanced. The targets I see
will be in the overall sense, including substitutes, avatars, and
manifestations. Then I can find the weak points in this whole. If
combined with Cull and Mighty Blow, and the target doesn't have enough
substitutes or avatars, I can wipe them all out at once. Even Demonesses
can't withstand a few such Culls."

"Sounds like it's aimed at Demonesses..." Franca muttered.

"Is that how the neighboring paths are?" Jenna said thoughtfully.

With a nod, Lumian said, "My weapons will be extensions of my body.
Ordinary objects can serve this role, they'll just be destroyed
afterward.

"There are corresponding qualitative changes in strength, stamina,
spirituality, intuition, tracking, and target pursuit. I can also fly by
the wind and levitate in the air."

At this, Lumian smiled. "And the last thing is that I've reverted to a
male."

Jenna's eyes moved slightly, and she muttered, "What about the fusion of
Hunter and Demoness abilities?"

Sitting in the armchair, Lumian raised his right hand, a black flame of
madness and destruction igniting in his palm.

Immediately, he stretched the black flame into a deep, oppressive
flaming greatsword.

Seeing this black flaming greatsword, Franca, Jenna, and Anthony all had
their hair stand on end, their bodies growing cold, as if the apocalypse
had arrived prematurely.

The eating Ludwig instinctively scooted two spaces further into the
other end of the sofa. "If I ever encounter a spatial seal again, I can
directly cleave a fissure in the barrier with the Sword of Destruction,
without needing to do any further attacks," Lumian flicked his wrist,
causing the quietly burning black flaming greatsword to dissipate.

He continued, "I can also 'insert' extreme weather or lethal attacks
into mirrors, guiding them through the mirror world to precisely target
locations, attacking people and environments outside the mirrors.

"Oh, and as long as the title conditions are met, I can respond to
prayers worldwide.

"Hmm, I can also hide Petrification powers within fireballs. After they
explode, the effect is released, affecting the surroundings, without
needing to spread it inch by inch.

"My mystical pathogens are more heat-resistant now and can spread
through rain, gales, and snowflakes, influencing a large area in the
shortest time, breaking the limitations of my own abilities.

"My Mythical Creature form, aside from igniting those who witness or
approach me and creating various weather phenomena, can also petrify
them, induce extreme euphoria, immediately sicken them, curse them, or
make them deeply infatuated with me..."

After describing his abilities, Lumian concluded, "If I don't suppress
and restrain my psyche, the weather in the areas I'm in will gradually
become more volatile and extreme, and the likelihood of war or massacre
events occurring will continually increase."

Listening to Lumian's account, the word that flashed through the minds
of Franca and the others was: *"Calamity."*

Disasters of all kinds, both natural and man-made.
