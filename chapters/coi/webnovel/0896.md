## Chapter 896: Charm

Seeing that the Demoness of Black had no immediate intention to attack
her, and didn't seem to be secretly releasing Plague, Franca steadied
herself and began reciting her pre-rehearsed words, "That day, Lumian
suddenly said that the Rose School of Thought had brought a very
important item to Trier, which could potentially cause chaos and affect
us, so we needed to quickly move to another safe house..."

This time, Franca pushed all the problems and abnormalities onto Lumian,
saying she didn't know why this lover she met through the Iron and Blood
Cross Order was hiding so many secrets. Despite not being very powerful,
he seemed to have a very high status, to the extent that after a
dazzling light suddenly burst in the sky over Trier, it attracted the
attack of two bestowed demigods.

Franca truthfully recounted her role in the subsequent battle, only
omitting Jenna's abilities and Anthony's revolver. Finally, she said,
"At the most critical moment, Lumian came back. He had actually become a
Demoness of Despair and quickly killed Higdon, then dealt with Voisin
Sanson."

"And then?" the Demoness of Black in the glass window asked.

"She left," Franca answered simply, without further explanation.

She originally felt that although her description was reasonably
fabricated, as someone who wasn't a descendant of the Demoness family,
with an origin that only seemed clear, having long shared a bed with
someone carrying many secrets and special qualities, experiencing many
things together, was inherently suspicious. Who could guarantee she
hadn't developed some issues because of this?

After the brief battle earlier, she had completely lost confidence in
her ability to deceive the Demoness of Black, and was merely giving her
a reason to pretend.

"Lumian Lee indeed has quite a few issues. Once exposed, he certainly
wouldn't dare stay here anymore," the Demoness of Black said in a very
calm tone.

Then, she chuckled softly. "The only pity is that you've lost the most
valiant lover below demigod level. The few times I came to look, you
were always enjoying yourself immensely, it was enviable."

"..." Franca was stunned for a moment, instinctively cursing in her
heart, *Dammit! When did she see that? Wasn't there a Bottle of
Fiction?*

Thinking about the Demoness of Black seeing her in that state, her face
nearly turned green.

She carefully recalled and realized this couldn't really be blamed on
Lumian, it was all her own doing---after the first two or three times,
she had gotten used to it and found an entertaining point, which was to
tease and Charm Lumian until he became urgent, to the point where even
the Ascetic couldn't remind him to create the Bottle of Fiction.

*What is this called? It's called bringing a calamity upon oneself! I
hope the Demoness of Black hadn't seen what I did later to digest the
Affliction potion... I hope... Mr. Fool, please protect your devout
believer from social death!* Franca laughed dryly. "Indeed, he
was much more impressive than I had anticipated, but I don't want to
mention him anymore. No, her. This bastard not only kept so many secrets
from me, but also seduced my other lover Jenna, cuckolding me. I've even
digested half of the Affliction potion because of this."

She was laying the groundwork for her rapid digestion of the Affliction
potion.

Of course, as said before, giving the Demoness of Black a reason to keep
pretending.

"There was such a thing?" The Demoness of Black's face, white to the
point of slight transparency, revealed a slight smile, as if she had
long guessed that a Sequence 5 Beyonder of the manly pathway like Lumian
Lee, frequently in contact with Franca's female lover, would inevitably
have a day when he couldn't resist.

"Yes." Franca dug up her true feelings from that time and gritted her
teeth.

"You didn't cut off his thing, or force-feed him a potion from the
Demoness pathway?" The Demoness of Black relaxed her expression, rarely
making a joke. "Well, his sequence is too high, you couldn't make him
advance to become a Demoness of Despair.

"Among my lovers, if any male lover is destined to become a Demoness, I
don't mind him sleeping with my female lovers, since he'll lose it
sooner or later and become a female lover. If I hadn't originally
planned for him to walk the Demoness pathway, I would have let him know
what pain really is."

*You real Demonesses sure play a perverted game...* Franca
inwardly criticized before saying, "I initially had thoughts of revenge,
but later gave up. As an adult, I don't make choices---I take
everything!"

At this point, Franca deliberately hesitated. "Moreover, I sensed some
issues at the time. He seemed to have a false high status, and torturing
him would make my Affliction potion digest rapidly, but before I could
probe the real reason, everything exploded."

The Demoness of Black nodded slightly, looking at Franca with an
appreciative gaze for two seconds. "No wonder you played that kind of
game. It's very interesting, very suitable for a Demoness."

"..." Franca's toes were already constantly scratching the ground inside
her boots.

"However, your endurance isn't too good," the Demoness of Black said in
an instructive tone.

Franca smiled sheepishly and said, "I only made him endure, not
myself..."

"Endurance is also a form of pain. This would allow you to digest the
potion from another aspect," the Demoness of Black said seriously,
suppressing the smile on her face.

"That's true..." Franca blinked her eyes.

*Why didn't I think of that at the time? Otherwise, I would have
completely digested the Affliction potion by now!*

*Ah, I was too focused on having fun!*

*But Beyonders can't think about "acting" every moment, right? One needs
to learn to relax, to learn to use pure entertainment to relieve mental
pressure and accumulated tendencies towards losing control!*

Franca really didn't want to continue this embarrassing topic, so she
took the initiative to say, "But I'll be able to completely digest the
Affliction potion in at most two or three weeks."

She had recently been recalling previously learned knowledge, purchasing
general-purpose textbooks, and trying to create exam papers for Ludwig.

She believed that just once would be enough to achieve her goal.

This would only take a few days.

The Demoness of Black didn't mention anything about subsequent
advancement, which Franca didn't find strange---her current self was
highly suspicious, and if the Demoness of Black were to promise to
provide the formula and ingredients for the Demoness of Despair, it
would mean that the subsequent arrangements would inevitably involve
very dangerous traps.

*What a situation this is... I know I'm lying, the Demoness of Black
knows I'm lying, and I also know that the Demoness of Black knows I'm
lying...* Franca sighed inwardly, and according to the Demoness
of Black's questions, she detailed Lumian's appearance and abilities
after he became a Demoness of Despair.

The Demoness of Black listened quietly, then suddenly walked out of the
glass window into the grayish-white dominated living room.

Seeing this, alarm bells immediately rang in Franca's heart.

The current situation was clearly the result of Petrification, an
ability unique to high-ranking members of the Demoness pathway, yet the
Demoness of Black hadn't asked a single question about what had
happened!

The Demoness of Black looked at Franca, her lips gently blossoming into
a smile that seemed to cast a glow over the stone room.

Franca found herself uncontrollably drawn in, completely unable to look
away.

The Demoness of Black extended her right hand and said in a gentle
voice, "You only have one lover left now, but you can become my lover."

Franca suddenly felt that the Demoness of Black was filled with a sacred
aura, making her want to protect and also ravish her.

Then, a watery gleam appeared in the Demoness of Black's eyes, taking on
a soft and sorrowful quality that made Franca want to merge with her out
of pity.

The Demoness of Black walked step by step towards Franca, her right hand
still extended, like a queen waiting for her knight to kiss it.

Franca was suddenly overwhelmed by a strong desire to conquer.

In this way, the Demoness of Black continuously changed her aura, as if
searching for the one that would most captivate Franca.

Franca's breathing had already become belabored, and she instinctively
blurted out, "No need."

This sentence was like a spell, instantly dispelling the current
romantic atmosphere. The Demoness of Black returned to her original
appearance, stopping just two steps away from Franca.

"Give me a reason," the Demoness of Black asked very calmly, showing no
signs of disappointment or anger.

Franca's cheeks had become flushed at some point, her body trembling
slightly, as if that refusal had used up all her strength.

Her mind raced, quickly finding a very good reason.

"Madame, you said that endurance is also a form of pain. I want to take
the opportunity of losing a lover to practice abstinence for a while, to
accelerate the complete digestion of the Affliction potion."

A faint smile reappeared on the Demoness of Black's face.

"Your willpower is stronger than I expected. Although I wasn't using my
full Charm on you just now, the fact that you could still refuse my
proposal without me deliberately suppressing the Charm shows that your
willpower is among the best among Sequence 5 Beyonders."

*Is that so... What was I thinking of that made me refuse such a great
temptation...* Franca recalled, her expression changing
slightly.

At that moment, she had thought of Jenna, and also of Lumian.

This both surprised and didn't surprise her.

The lack of surprise referred to thinking of Jenna at the critical
moment of being Charmed, while the surprise was that she had also
thought of Lumian!

The Demoness of Black looked around and said, "I'll wait for you to
completely digest the Affliction potion. During this time, I have a task
for you. Make contact with the core members of the Emperor Party. You
should have heard the voice saying 'Your emperor has returned' that day.
Those fantasists who worship Roselle and want to restore the empire seem
to have new ideas because of this. Perhaps we can use them to do
something.

"The specific situation will be told to you by Niceea. She was
originally a spy employed by the government, specifically monitoring the
Emperor Party. She has just become a Witch not long ago.

"This is her contact information...

"If you want to obtain the formula and ingredients for the Demoness of
Despair from me, you need to make good contributions to the sect."

Franca took the paper handed over by the Demoness of Black and
"sincerely" responded, "Yes, Madame Clarice."

The Demoness of Black didn't say anything more. Layers of dark spaces
appeared in her eyes.

Her figure then disappeared from the room. She hadn't mentioned a single
word about the complete grayish-white state of the scene.

Not long after, Lumian walked out of Jenna's bedroom, grabbed Franca's
arm, and entered the full-length mirror in the living room.

The corpse pieces of the Demoness of Black in the area behind the mirror
had completely disappeared.
