## Chapter 428: Incineration

*Sacred Heart Cloister? The largest cloister in Trier's Eternal Blazing
Sun Church? Why did Albus Medici go there? Could he be an undercover
agent sent by the Purifier into the Iron and Blood Cross Order? Or did
Gardner Martin instruct him to keep an eye on the Sacred Heart
Cloister?* Lumian's mind raced with questions and guesses.

As he advanced, clutching a carbide lamp, Iraeta hastily interjected
with more information.

"I have a friend at the Sacred Heart Cloister. I often go there to drink
with him."

Lumian, momentarily diverting his focus from Albus Medici, jested, "Can
the cloister monks drink?"

The two moved through the shadowy passageway, guided solely by the
yellowish glow of the carbide lamp.

Iraeta rambled, "Of course they can, but they can't partake in liquor or
get inebriated. The wine brewed by the Sacred Heart Cloister is the
finest I've ever tasted."

"Is your friend a monk?" Lumian walked at a moderate pace, his footsteps
echoing through the seemingly endless passageway.

Iraeta appeared content conversing with Ciel and didn't hide anything.

"Yes, he's a member of the Brotherhood Minor and served as my nephew's
baptism priest. Later, he could no longer tolerate the cathedral's
clergy indulging in pleasures and chose to become a monk. He joined the
Sacred Heart Cloister and is currently overseeing the brewery."

*A member of the Brotherhood Minor, champions of temperance and
asceticism... *Lumian deduced this and redirected their
conversation.

"How often have you and your friend seen Albus Medici? What was the
reason for his visit to the Sacred Heart Cloister?"

"Just once," Iraeta muttered. "I don't concern myself with such matters.
There are no nuns there. When I saw him, he was walking through the
corridor with a monk and entered the rear of the cloister."

*It appears that Albus Medici had not entered covertly or with fear of
discovery...* Lumian deduced this from Iraeta's account.

Amidst Poet Iraeta's relentless search for topics, the two of them
finally passed through the eerie wax statue room, leaving behind the
hall with the enigmatic doors of Hope, Madness, and Death. They retraced
their steps to the underground palace.

Iraeta let out a long sigh of relief and relaxed. He grumbled, "The
underground palace is so dangerous, and there are creatures with
supernatural abilities. Poufer truly led us into an adventure down here!

"Is he attempting to get us killed?"

*You've all been corrupted by the King's Pie game many times. I wonder
if you're truly alive...* Lumian refrained from a direct
response to Iraeta's grievances, opting for a playful smile as he
remarked,

"It seems that the more frightened and tense you are, the more you like
to talk."

"That's what makes me feel alive," Iraeta confessed. He extinguished the
carbide lamp as they exited the underground palace via the spiral
staircase.

Lumian turned back, retracing his steps to the Door of Madness.

He hadn't closed the door when he left. Even though he hadn't approached
yet, the yellowish light from the carbide lamp made the wax statues
appear faintly, as if they were waiting in the darkness.

Lumian stopped at the door, slowly bent down, and placed the carbide
lamp on the ground in front of him.

Then, he straightened up and swept his gaze across the wax statues'
faces, their expressions frozen in agony and shrouded in shadows.

Crimson Fire Ravens began to materialize around him, one after another.

Since Count Poufer had shown ill intent by leading them into the
perilous depths of the underground palace---any ordinary person would
already have died---there was no reason to show any courtesy to a member
of the Sauron family, the owner of Red Swan Castle!

Lumian's plan was straightforward: to set the wax statues ablaze. This
had several purposes. First, it might assist in digesting his potion.
Second, it could preemptively eliminate potential threats, preventing
the wax statues from coming to life and attacking at a critical moment.
Lastly, it could create a chaotic situation that would disrupt Count
Poufer's secret plan, sowing doubt and confusion for their further
exploration.

Chaos often created opportunities.

*Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!* With a swift motion, he released a
flurry of Crimson Fire Ravens that darted towards the wax statues.

After dispatching two batches of Fire Ravens, Lumian dropped to one
knee, pressing his hands to the ground.

From his palms, fiery serpents slithered out, winding their way through
the pile of wax statues and swiftly igniting them.

A cacophony of explosions followed as the wax statues' heads burst, and
their lower extremities were engulfed in flames, creating a cage of
crimson fire.

The flesh-white wax that composed their bodies melted rapidly, turning
into liquid droplets or softening and crumbling away, rendering them
fragile under the dual onslaught of explosion and combustion.

*Smack!*

The "muscles" on one of the wax statues completely disintegrated,
revealing a new face.

It was a human face!

It was a male human who had lost his eyes and died long ago, his face
filled with pain!

Silently, more wax statues softened and crumbled.

Without exception, there was a human corpse inside every one of them.

Among the corpses encased in the wax statues were men and women, some
with exposed flesh and skin, others with heads and bodies that appeared
to have been crudely stitched together after death. Some had open
stomachs, their intestines tangled and filled with white wax, creating a
grotesque sight...

What all of them had in common was the haunting expression of pain
etched across their faces, as if they had lived through unspeakable
horrors or had been trapped in the darkest of nightmares.

As Lumian observed, the melted wax transformed into a viscous liquid
that oozed from the faces of the deceased humans. It was as if these
tortured souls were weeping tears of relief as they faced the purifying
embrace of the flames.

*Inside the statues are actually real people...* Lumian, who had
his fair share of horrifying scenes, couldn't help but tense up,
instinctively feeling repulsed and afraid.

He finally knew where the ordinary people from Red Swan Castle who had
gone mad and mutilated themselves in his nightmares had gone.

Lumian rose to his feet, clutching the carbide lamp. Crimson flames
erupted from his body, transforming into blazing meteors that streaked
to every corner of the wax statue-filled chamber, turning it into an
inferno.

The flesh-white wax began to burn fervently, feeding upon itself until
there was no space left for the fire to consume.

Lumian's eyes reflected the crimson conflagration and the viscous wax
tears on his pale face.

He didn't avert his gaze but watched intently.

At that moment, he gained a newfound understanding of his pyromaniac
abilities. The once-vague third acting principle became clear.

The Pyromaniac wreaked havoc and caused utter catastrophe!

As for Pyromaniacs, they could willingly unleash disaster and
destruction upon anyone.

Lumian fervently wished that the heretics and those who had gone "mad"
and could only harm others would be engulfed by the flames!

Having amalgamated his various acts into this principle, Lumian had an
uncommonly clear sense that his Pyromaniac potion had been entirely
digested. He could even hear an imaginary shattering sound.

With a series of thuds, the lifeless bodies, stripped of their wax
support, fell one by one to the ground. They piled up and burned even
more fiercely.

All of a sudden, the wooden door creaked open from the exit opposite the
wax statue's chamber.

The wax sculptor, his thick beard and hair resembling a humanoid lion,
stood before Lumian.

His iron-black eyes were tinged crimson by the flames that surged toward
the ceiling. His voice sounded ethereal as he inquired, "Why... did
you... set my wax statues ablaze?"

Lumian didn't answer; instead, he activated the black mark on his right
shoulder.

Spirit World Traversal!

A spectral light flickered within his clothing, and his form swiftly
materialized next to the wax sculptor.

Almost simultaneously, Lumian parted his lips.

"Ha!"

A pale-yellow, gaseous light shot out of his mouth and struck the wax
sculptor's head.

The wax sculptor, clad in a grayish-black robe, swayed visibly, as if
momentarily losing his balance. He didn't lose consciousness completely;
it was more like he had undergone a Psychic Piercing and was in a state
of shock induced by the pain.

Lumian didn't rely solely on the Spell of Harrumph. He raised his
prepared left palm and hurled a crimson fireball, tightly compressed in
layers, into the wax sculptor's mouth and nose with Fire Infusion.

The fireball, gradually turning white in color, whooshed into the
target's mouth and nostrils, invading his brain.

*Boom!*

The blazing white fireball exploded from the inside out while Lumian
watched as the wax sculptor's head expanded rapidly before exploding.

Flaming flesh and blood spurted out. Lumian, already prepared, shielded
his face with the carbide lamp in his right hand, leaving the back of
his hand stained with blood.

With a thud, the wax sculptor, with only a small half of his head
remaining, swayed and collapsed to the ground.

Lumian, who had meticulously prepared a sequence of attacks, found
himself momentarily taken aback. He hadn't expected the situation to
resolve so effortlessly.

He had foreseen that the enigmatic wax sculptor might pose a formidable
challenge, and he had readied himself to "teleport" instantly if things
took a turn for the worse.

It was worth noting that the wax statue that had reanimated previously
had been more formidable than the wax sculptor himself. Merely being in
its presence had weighed heavily on Lumian's body and mind, almost
rendering him incapable of resistance.

*Did he possess the unique ability to create these wax statues, but
lacked inherent power? Or did he need to draw strength from the Sauron
family's underground palace to bring these menacing wax figures to life?
Perhaps my attack was too swift, leaving him no time to react. He
perished on the spot before he could tap into any external
strength?* Lumian gazed down at the wax sculptor and assessed
the situation.

*†*

In the depths of the underground palace, within a hall adorned with
white candles,

Poufer Sauron, seated in a corner, abruptly opened his eyes and fixed
his gaze upon the bronze coffin situated in the center of the chamber.

Around the coffin, numerous candles strangely extinguished without
warning.

*Wh---* Poufer rose to his feet, his expression slightly twisted
in consternation.

†

At the exit of the wax statue chamber, Lumian witnessed a crimson
radiance emanating from the wax sculptor's body.

Initially, the luminescence surged towards the head, but only a small
fragment of the wax sculptor's head remained. Consequently, it shifted
to his chest, yet it couldn't dissipate.

Lumian felt a tinge of surprise. He tore open the grayish-black robe of
the wax statue master, unveiling his chest.

There lay a sinister, pitch-black wound, and the space where his heart
should have resided was hollow!

*The heart is missing... Elros had mentioned that the Sauron family
members' hearts had to be sent deep into the underground
palace...* Lumian vaguely grasped the reason behind the wax
sculptor's formidable yet fragile nature.

Ultimately, the crimson light coalesced into an ethereal entity with
myriad gullies, resembling a shrunken blood-colored brain.

Unsure of its significance, Lumian stashed it away and made his exit.

The flames in the room continued to burn, but for some unknown reason,
they failed to spread.

†

In the stone pillar hall where the confrontation with the black spider
had transpired.

Albus and Elros observed as Lumian returned, carrying a carbide lamp
that emitted a faint yellowish glow.

Almost simultaneously, they noticed the specks of blood on Lumian's
body.

"Did you kill the poet?" Albus asked, amused.

Lumian shook his head and replied calmly, "I killed the one making the
wax statues."
