## Chapter 991: Proactive Small Talk

After suspecting that Zaratulstra had replaced the teachers at Dream
Tutoring Classes and Star Tutoring Classes to target the image of
Gehrman Sparrow, who didn't actually exist in the dream city, Lumian and
the others discussed this for quite a while, but still couldn't figure
out the significance and purpose of doing so.

They decided to write a letter, which Franca and Jenna would take to
Star Dream Provisions Store tomorrow to mail out, to see what opinions
the Major Arcana card holders would give.

As they stood up, preparing to leave the rented apartment in Xinhong
District, Franca remembered something and curiously looked at Lumian.
"You said earlier that Li Keji's pregnancy was because Grimm's
cognition, the Omebella bloodline in you, and the Celestial Worthy's
subconscious taking dominance because of Mushu Hospital's environment,
equating you with the Child of God Omebella in the dream, making your
casual comment 'he's already pregnant' become reality. So, as the Child
of God Omebella, can you now use the Beyonder powers of a Planter,
Apothecary, and Heretic Spellmaster pathways?"

Franca's eyes gleamed, feeling this had a bit of a "I guess that went
well" flavor to it.

Of course, this "I" referred to the dream subconscious.

As long as the dream subconscious believed it, anything could happen!

Lumian tried to see if he could use the abilities related to Vampire,
Harvest Priest, and Heretic Spellmaster, but all attempts failed.

"It doesn't work." He shook his head.

Before Franca could respond, he added thoughtfully, "Maybe it's possible
in Mushu Hospital."

As Franca nodded in agreement, Jenna reminded Lumian, "If that's really
the case, frequent visits to Mushu Hospital might cause you to become
more and more like Omebella, until you're completely equivalent."

Lumian pondered for a few seconds, then said gravely, "It's a
possibility."

Franca immediately hissed. "How sinister is the Great Mother's style,
always making people fall into traps unknowingly? Sometimes, being
vigilant seems useless..."

At this point, Franca answered her own question, "Judging by the name,
perhaps the Great Mother symbolizes the 'yin'---'darkness' in the term
'yin-yang'..."

The next day, which was Sunday, Lumian again brought Ludwig to Dream
Tutoring Classes.

While sending the child into the classroom, he discreetly observed the
front desk, every teacher he encountered, and Anderson Hood with his Eye
of Calamity.

Except for the latter, the mercury-colored river of fate corresponding
to the others all showed a black color representing death at some point
in the past. Some of these black patches had become blurred, while
others were still relatively clear, flowing forward with the illusory
river, getting further and further behind, becoming harder to see.

*They are indeed reborn people...* Lumian didn't engage in
conversation with Anderson Hood, but stepped back and sat in his usual
spot.

Just as he was about to contemplate how to handle this situation, he
suddenly saw Zhou Mingrui, wearing a loose sky-blue T-shirt, walking
towards him.

*How dedicated, to still remember to come for Business English class
after witnessing Zaratulstra being shot and observing Mr.
Cui...* Lumian mused, standing up to greet Zhou Mingrui.

As fellow employees of Intis Group who had met more than once, this was
expected courtesy.

Seeing this, Zhou Mingrui returned the greeting.

Just when Lumian thought he would smoothly turn into the classroom, Zhou
Mingrui stopped, right in front of him.

Zhou Mingrui looked around and asked, "Has Mr. Da resigned? I haven't
seen him every time I've come recently.

"You know Mr. Da, right?"

"Yes, Da Nizi. I brought my child here to enroll after seeing the flier
he handed out," Lumian answered simply.

He hadn't expected Zhou Mingrui to initiate casual conversation with
him, and even ask about the Oracle Danitz.

*Stimulated by the Zaratulstra incident, has Zhou Mingrui started to
more actively explore the hidden anomalies around him, more boldly
engaging with us problematic people, and thus discovered that Teacher Da
from Dream Tutoring Classes hasn't appeared recently? This is good news!
Hmm, there's also a downside, if he keeps investigating like this, who
knows when my team and I might be kicked out of the dream without
warning, just like Mr. Cui...* Lumian's thoughts raced, forming
a rough judgment.

Before Zhou Mingrui could ask further, he sighed and said, "Mr. Da
didn't resign, he passed away."

"Ah?" Zhou Mingrui's gaze suddenly froze.

His shock and surprise showed on his face.

This was also the expected reaction of a normal person hearing such
news.

"When did this happen? What happened?" Zhou Mingrui didn't hide his
astonishment.

Lumian glanced towards the front desk.

"I heard Ms. Ai say that he seemed to have encountered a psychopathic
killer and was strangled to death.

"At first, Ms. Ai and Mr. Anderson thought he was just missing, and
because they didn't have much confidence in Mr. Da's ability to survive
alone, they quickly reported it to the police. Later, after searching,
the police found Mr. Da in the underground morgue of Mushu Hospital, in
the form of a corpse."

Lumian's words were all information that Ms. Ai Nana had previously
mentioned and could be found online, so he wasn't worried about being
kicked out of the dream again because of this---after re-entering the
dream, he planned to behave for two or three days in front of Zhou
Mingrui.

"Killed..." Zhou Mingrui's eyes flickered as he fell into deep thought.

"Yes, the body was discovered in the underground morgue of Mushu
Hospital," Lumian deliberately emphasized.

He was trying to guide Zhou Mingrui to notice that there might be
problems with Mushu Hospital through normal conversation.

"The killer deliberately sent Mr. Da's body to the underground morgue?"
Zhou Mingrui expressed his confusion.

Lumian shook his head. "It might not have been the killer, it could have
been a passerby who discovered the body and sent it there."

"How is that possible? A passerby who sees a body would call the police
directly." Zhou Mingrui increasingly felt that there was something fishy
about this matter.

"But why would the killer have to send Mr. Da's body to the underground
morgue of Mushu Hospital? Did he think it wouldn't be discovered if
hidden there? What made him think that..." Lumian was responsible for
raising questions, emphasizing Mushu Hospital, but not providing
answers.

For him now, providing answers was too dangerous.

Zhou Mingrui nodded thoughtfully, then pointed to the Business English
classroom. "I'm going to class now."

"Alright," Lumian sat down accordingly.

He leaned against the classroom wall, his thoughts gradually spreading:

*The secret replacement of teachers at Dream Tutoring Classes and Star
Tutoring Classes is really difficult to resolve...*

*If this were in the real world, I would find an opportunity to blow up
the underground part of Mushu Hospital, completely eliminating the
hidden danger. But in the dream city, with the underground part of Mushu
Hospital being the psychological trauma of a great existence and an
infiltration point for the power of other great existences, I'm afraid
even the owner of Star Dream Provisions Store and Stianos wouldn't dare
to venture there easily, even if they weren't restricted...*

*Using the Eye of Calamity to distinguish whether the target is a reborn
person, should we kill all those who have been replaced, like Huang
Jiajia, Ai Nana, and others, to eliminate them?*

*I'm confident I could cover up the traces and not be discovered if I
kill one, but killing so many? Do they think the dream city's police
department and Chief Yagates are dead? This would be openly challenging
the dream's main consciousness, and I might be identified the next
day...*

*Moreover, with Huang Jiajia and others being related to the identity of
Gehrman Sparrow, if they all exit the stage of the dream city, it might
bring about unfavorable changes, or cause the subsequent awakening plan
to be doomed to failure from the start...*

*Report it? Without sufficient clues, it might end up like the previous
report about Zaratulstra, with no response at all...*

*What clues could make the police investigate deeply and discover the
abnormalities?*

*I hope the Major Arcana card holders can provide good ideas...*

*Hmm...*

As Lumian's thoughts became more and more scattered, he caught sight of
Zhou Mingrui coming out of the classroom with his phone, walking towards
the restroom.

Lumian tilted his head, using his Hunter ears to eavesdrop on what Zhou
Mingrui was saying from a distance.

He heard Zhou Mingrui ask in surprise, "Weren't you scheduled to come on
Monday? Why has it been postponed to Wednesday?"

From the other end of the phone, a female voice faintly reached Lumian's
ears.

"I thought about it, you have to work during the week and can't take me
out, so I might as well just go directly to report in."

Zhou Mingrui was silent for a moment, then said, "I have annual leave."

"It's fine, you can take me out on the weekend." The female voice on the
phone said cheerfully.

Zhou Mingrui sighed and said, "Alright then, what time is your train on
Wednesday?"

Hearing this, Lumian roughly understood what was going on.

According to the information provided by the Major Arcana, Zhou
Mingrui's sister Zhou Shasha had been admitted to a university in Yangdu
and was about to come here to study.

*Zhou Shasha will arrive in Yangdu next Wednesday? As one of the dream
manifestations closest to Zhou Mingrui, what changes will her arrival
bring?* Lumian raised his right hand to rub his temples, feeling
that one wave of events was following another without pause.

Star Dream Provisions Store.

Franca and Jenna, who had taken a taxi, walked into the dimly lit
interior of the shop.

The former politely asked the shop owner if they could mail a letter,
while the latter lingered in the entrance area, both examining the
antiques on the shelves and observing the situation outside.

After getting the shop owner's permission, Franca turned to the shelf
and dropped the letter in her hand into the silver-inlaid black mailbox.

As her gaze swept across, she noticed that the Pride Armor that once
belonged to her was standing quietly on the edge of the inner side of
the right shelf.

The surface of this silver-white full-body armor was somehow stained
with patches and spots of dark red blood. Just seeing it gave Franca a
feeling of rapidly weakening, as if her serious illness had returned.

*It's become even more sinister...* Franca didn't dare ask the
shop owner what had happened to the Pride Armor, and quickly averted her
gaze, walking towards the door.

At this moment, Jenna raised her hand slightly, discreetly pointing to
the diagonal opposite side of the street.

There, perched on the branch of a street tree, was a white pigeon.
