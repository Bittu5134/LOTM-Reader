## Chapter 554: Favor

Lumian's gaze fixated on the Minor Arcana card before he noticed another
person standing in front of the full-body mirror in the room.

The man sported a white shirt and a black vest, his face unusually pale
and his brown hair tousled, suggesting he had just woken up.

For some inexplicable reason, Lumian sensed a conflicting demeanor in
this person---elusive yet restrained. The brown eyes held an
indescribable weight, akin to staring into an abyss.

"Knight of Swords?" Lumian inquired.

The man nodded subtly and responded, "Seven of Wands, how may I assist
you?"

Surprised, Lumian questioned, "How do you know I'm the Seven of Wands?"
Lumian hadn't disclosed his exact code name in the letter, merely
stating he sought help from the Knight of Swords as guided by Madam
Magician.

The Knight of Swords spoke slowly, as if holding back something.

"Ma'am Hermit informed me that the Seven of Wands, affiliated with Madam
Magician, would soon arrive in Feynapotter, possibly in need of intel or
assistance."

Madam Magician intentionally communicated with Ma'am Hermit about me,
Lumian realized.

"I need your help locating two individuals in Port Santa and the
surrounding seas. Try not to alert any factions."

"Be specific," the Knight of Swords replied, economical with his words.

Lumian shared Batna Comté and Nolfi's details, adding, "I'm not certain
if they're still alive. They might have become corpses by now."

As he spoke, he handed two photo-like sketches to the Knight of
Swords---a unique skill he'd acquired from Aurore's grimoires and his
expertise in ritualistic magic. These images, directly replicated from
his mind, bore an uncanny resemblance to photographs.

The ritualistic magic involved in creating such images demanded a
suitable and secure target for prayer---a practice more common among
official Beyonders who had orthodox gods to appeal to. Wild Beyonders
rarely resorted to praying to dangerous entities for trivial matters.
Being part of the Tarot Club, Lumian straddled both worlds, with the
ability to seek aid from Mr. Fool or tap into Madam Magician's strength.

The Knight of Swords studied the photo-like sketches before affirming,
"I'll help you find them as soon as possible."

There was no demand for payment or any immediate request, prompting
Lumian to sigh.

*Organizations do have their advantages!*

Internal assistance often translated into favors, subtly binding
individuals to reciprocal obligations. Some preferred setting clear
prices rather than owing favors,

but Lumian didn't entertain such thoughts. Securing the Knight of
Swords' presence and help was already a considerable favor in itself.

He pondered for a moment and then inquired, "What mission do you have in
Feynapotter? Do you need my assistance?"

The Knight of Swords paused briefly before responding, "The matter in
Feynapotter is wrapping up, but I'll be heading to the Southern
Continent soon. I might require your help there."

"Sure thing," Lumian agreed.

Intrigued, he asked, "Is Ma'am Hermit also overseeing matters in the
Southern Continent?"

Wasn't she too busy?

Madam Magician had indicated that this Major Arcana card holder
primarily dealt with sea-related affairs and a clandestine organization
dedicated to the Hidden Sage, with little involvement in the Southern
Continent.

The Knight of Swords replied in a subdued tone, "It's a personal matter,
unrelated to Ma'am Hermit."

"Got it," Lumian acknowledged. Many of his past tasks weren't
orchestrated by Madam Magician, and even his mission in Port Santa to
track down April Fool's key member was considered personal business if
it didn't involve the Celestial Worthy.

After a two-second pause, the Knight of Swords added, "Moreover, I'm
only temporarily under Ma'am Hermit's command."

*What does he mean by temporarily subordinate? Can one switch to other
Major Arcana card holders in the future?* Lumian wondered.

Without explanation, the Knight of Swords' form suddenly turned ethereal
and disappeared.

Lumian, without activating his Spirit Vision, couldn't catch the
departing figure in time.

*It doesn't feel like teleportation or blending into the
shadows...* After a quick assessment, he changed into a
brownish-green short-sleeved shirt and loose brownish-yellow pants
commonly seen in Port Santa.

Exiting the master bedroom, Lumian tossed the Lie earring to Lugano.

"Go to Valerio and get the new IDs. Remember the face you used when you
last saw him."

"I remember it clearly." Lugano took the Lie earring.

As Lugano was about to proceed with his disguise, Lumian halted him.

"Find a secluded spot after leaving the room to use it. When you return,
shift back to your original appearance before entering the motel."

*Doesn't this mean I'll have this mystical item to myself for a while?
Aren't you worried I might take off with it? It's not just unique; it's
valuable!* Lugano refrained from probing further. Following his
employer's instructions, he took the Lie earring, a bag containing his
disguise, and exited the room.

Observing Lugano's departure, Lumian picked up a golden straw hat and
addressed Ludwig, "There's plenty of food in my bedroom. Stay put until
I'm back."

"Sure thing," Ludwig agreed, seemingly eager.

Would someone exploit the absence of his guardians to attack him, the
boy?

Lumian, passing by the sofa, casually placed the golden straw hat on
Ludwig's head.

Simultaneously, he switched to a common round-rimmed felt hat and left
the suite gradually.

He wasn't concerned about Ludwig being alone in the motel. In fact,
those who might come into contact with the boy faced more significant
risks.

Lumian adjusted his hat in the corridor and activated Shadow
Transformation.

Swiftly, he transformed into a pure shadow, blending into the darkness
at the base of the walls on both sides.

In the dark, veiled void, Lumian inhaled the scent of the gray amber
perfume he had deliberately left on the Lie earring, using it to track
Lugano.

His intent wasn't merely to determine whether the interpreter was
problematic but to anticipate a potential attack.

With adventurer Louis Berry probing the sea prayer ritual and presenting
himself as resolute and radical, it was likely the Fisheries Guild and
Milo Village would swiftly react in a decisive manner, eliminating this
outsider to dissuade others and factions from clandestinely stirring.

In this scenario, Lumian, Lugano, and Ludwig were at risk.

He specifically tasked Lugano to seek Valerio alone for the IDs,
intending to see if Juan Oro and others had their eyes on his
companions, seizing an opportunity to strike Lugano.

This strategy allowed Lumian to swiftly intervene if needed, rescuing
Lugano while potentially neutralizing some Beyonders from the Fisheries
Guild, showcasing the adventurer's strength and instilling confidence in
onlookers, compelling further attempts.

However, the Fisheries Guild and Milo Village might not act immediately.
They might feign vulnerability, luring hidden adversaries to reveal
themselves before eliminating them in one fell swoop.

Lumian shadowed Lugano to Valerio's underground casino, observing him
pay the remaining 50 gold risot for two local IDs.

*No attack... Could it be the Fisheries Guild is fishing, or did they
fail to recognize Lugano after he used the Lie earring?* Lumian
pondered the potential reasons while traversing through the shadows.

Lugano hurriedly avoided lingering on the streets, well aware that his
employer had incurred the wrath of the Fisheries Guild. He feared being
ambushed by those unwilling to target Lumian, dragged into an alley, and
subjected to a brutal beating.

Seeking refuge in a crevice between two buildings near Solow Motel, he
swiftly reverted to his altered appearance. Removing the Lie earring, he
switched into his customary black formal suit,

finally exhaling a sigh of relief. He turned onto Aquina Street and made
his way back to the motel's entrance.

Several tramps lay dozing on both sides of the street, basking lazily in
the sunlight.

Lumian was aware that unlike the severe tramp situation in the Loen
Kingdom and the Intis Republic, Feynapotter's tramp issue was less acute
due to fertile soil, ample pastures, and the Church's modified
agricultural methods, resulting in surplus food production.

Here, food was notably cheaper, about 15 to 20% lower compared to Intis
and other countries. Previously, before the Loen Kingdom began importing
food from Feynapotter, the price of rye bread of the same weight was
nearly twice as high.

Despite the abundance, bankrupt farmers, herders, and city dwellers
ended up as tramps due to land acquisition, loan sharks, and other
reasons. However, they received free food from various sources like the
cathedral of Earth Mother, the Fertility Order, government departments,
and charitable organizations, which although not filling, prevented
starvation, allowing them to recuperate and find new opportunities.

As Lugano neared Solow Motel, Lumian, concealed in the shadows, sensed a
disturbance.

Three tramps on the street abruptly stiffened, adjusting their postures
unnaturally.

In an instant, they sprang to their feet like puppet marionettes,
drawing revolvers in an odd manner and aiming at Lugano from three
different angles.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

Their white-eyed state left Lugano no room to evade as they pulled their
triggers successively.
