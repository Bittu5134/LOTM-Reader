## Chapter 324: Which Is True and Which Is False

After a brief mention of the reason for selecting his seat, Bühler
glanced up at Lumian, a self-deprecating smile on his lips.

"I didn't expect you to open fire so quickly."

Lumian's hand rested casually on the revolver by his side as he offered
a faint smile in return.

"It seems the folks you've encountered before are law-abiding citizens."

Bühler's instincts, honed from past experiences of being beaten, urged
him to retort. But as he compared Lumian's demeanor with those of his
previous encounters, he found a strange logic in the man's words.

Thanks to the shelter of the law, he, a columnist for Ghost Face, had
managed to survive up to this point!

"Are you not afraid of attracting the police?" Bühler turned to look at
the waiter, who dared not approach with the menu and drink list. "Firing
a gun in a place like this isn't a minor incident. Someone should have
already alerted the authorities."

Lumian chuckled.

"That's why we have to hurry."

His words punctuated by deliberate actions, Lumian picked up his
revolver, rotated the cylinder, and slotted a yellow cartridge into the
empty chamber, right before Bühler's eyes.

"I want to know which courtesans have left Rue de la Muraille, this
haven of extravagance, in the last two months," Lumian inquired with a
calm resolve.

Instinctively, Bühler shook his head. "They aren't true courtesans.
Those women possess their lavish residences and permanent paramours.
They frequent high society, wielding influence over industries and
policies with their words alone. This place merely acts as a reserve for
courtesans."

"I'm only interested in those who fit my description." Lumian dismissed
the specifics of courtesanship.

Bühler's gaze flickered between the revolver in Lumian's grip and said,
recollecting,

"Four of them. Lil' Jort wed a Loen merchant and relocated to Backlund.
'White Vase' Sophie became the lover of Member of Parliament Batis,
attending high society banquets and salons. She had a chance of becoming
a true courtesan. 'Dew Rose' Mary fell victim to mental illness and
mutilated her face with scissors one morning. She's confined to an
asylum. 'Condiment Beauty' Paulina vanished from Rue de la Muraille
without a trace, as though whisked away by someone of status."

As Bühler recounted, he noticed the dashing figure before him, ready to
fire at the slightest provocation, producing a post-it note and a
fountain pen, meticulously jotting down notes.

Swallowing unease, he continued, "I encountered Paulina on Rue Vincent
not long ago. She seemed well off, with a four-wheeled carriage, a maid,
a valet, and even a butler.

"Sadly, I had pressing matters then and failed to determine her place of
residence."

*Rue Vincent...* Lumian's memory jogged. It was one of the five
streets Franca had divined. Farthest from Rue de la Muraille, it exuded
a quieter, upscale aura.

Based on Bühler's account, he suspected Paulina had become Guillaume
Bénet's paramour.

For a fugitive, a prospective courtesan proved a safer choice than
frequenting Rue de la Muraille. Guillaume Bénet was intelligent and
capable. His present yearnings for intimacy and his voracious hunger
hadn't rendered him a mindless imbecile. He would surely opt for a less
risky strategy.

Just then, hurried footsteps resonated outside the café as three police
officers neared the entrance.

Coolly, Lumian donned his dark-blue cap, stashed his note and pen, and
slid 50 verl d'or notes onto the table before Bühler.

With these tasks accomplished, he reclaimed his revolver, stood up, and
proceeded to the café's rear door. Swiftly, he opened it and departed.

*Bang!*

The police officers burst into Hope Café through its main entrance.

On the elegant street of Rue Vincent, stately villa-like houses adorned
both sides of the road. The road was wide and well-kept, with only
occasional pedestrians and carriages passing through.

After Lumian turned into the street, he found himself at a loss.

He couldn't infiltrate every house and search every room, could he?

Besides, he wasn't the most suitable candidate for this kind of
investigation. Franca would be better suited for it, but involving her
was risky.

After a brief contemplation, Lumian allowed a smile to grace his
features. He strolled toward one of the houses and pressed the doorbell.

A young valet opened the dark-brown door. His appearance suggested no
trace of Southern Continent lineage, and he gazed at Lumian in
bewilderment. In a clear Trierien accent, he inquired,

"Monsieur, how may I assist you?"

With an amiable grin, Lumian replied, "I'm here to inquire about the
most splendid madam residing on this street."

"..." The valet was momentarily speechless. This was the first instance
he'd encountered someone seeking such peculiar information.

Or perhaps not. While such matters were whispered about behind closed
doors and boasted about in taverns, there were occasionally individuals
who exhibited curiosity about such affairs. However, who would approach
a stranger's door in the sweltering sun to inquire?

*What was this person up to?*

Before the valet could react, Lumian produced a 10 verl d'or note and
offered it with a genial demeanor.

The valet's eyelids twitched. He hesitated for a moment before accepting
the payment.

He suspected this young man to be a counterfeit Dandyist, specialized in
duping affluent ladies of their bodies and riches. The appearance and
conduct matched the descriptions found in newspapers.

However, if the lady wasn't the valet's mistress or lady, why refuse the
reward?

When the stranger acquired what he sought, a certain madam would also
receive some gratification!

The valet cast a furtive glance around before lowering his voice.

"The lady in Unit 50 is exquisitely beautiful. A genuine Trierien, she
married a foreigner from the southern lands. That accent..."

As the valet spoke, he shook his head with a mixture of indignation and
scorn, as if he had harbored this sentiment for some time.

Lumian's smile broadened.

Indeed, under the sway of his burgeoning impulses, the padre couldn't
resist sharing his prize with the neighbors---a stunning Trierien
courtesan.

He might not host grand banquets or waltz to proclaim his conquest, nor
would he escort his lover for a public appearance. Nonetheless, he would
inevitably find subtle ways to make his neighbors aware that even
foreigners could possess resplendent courtesans as mistresses.

At times like this, Guillaume Bénet had to exercise prudence in
disguising himself. However, his mistress's beauty wasn't something
easily concealed. She might even meticulously dress herself to exhibit
her remarkable presence.

Of course, Lumian couldn't be certain if the lady was Paulina, the
presumed mistress. Yet, the gradual collection of anticipated
information through bold assumptions and careful confirmation made him
feel he was steadily closing in on Guillaume Bénet.

Beyond the gates of 50 Rue Vincent, Lumian glanced at the facade as an
ordinary passerby might.

The three-story beige structure stood before him, surrounded by a lush
green lawn and a garden vibrant with colors. A gardener tended to the
greenery, offering a partial view.

Lumian promptly averted his gaze from the building's pillar, wary that
prolonged observation could arouse suspicion.

As for any possibility of being recognized by the padre, Lumian held no
concern. Prior to setting out, he had employed Niese Face to alter his
appearance and communicated to his companions that it was due to
cosmetics.

Lumian's striking appearance---a fusion of golden and black hair---could
be anyone's. As long as Guillaume Bénet lacked the ability to penetrate
the illusion or actively employ it, it was unlikely he'd realize his
pursuer had infiltrated the vicinity.

Lumian's current plan was to leave Rue Vincent and switch places with
Jenna or Franca. He would then ensconce himself in the shadows across
from Unit 50, patiently observing until all suspicion around the target
was dissipated.

He refrained from adopting the guise of a tramp this time, given the
scarcity of such individuals on this refined street. While a rare
appearance might occur, these transients were promptly shooed away by
the household staff.

Just as he prepared to depart from the beige edifice, Lumian turned his
head in a casual manner. His gaze alighted on a figure visible through
the living room window.

The figure stood at a modest height, barely reaching 1.7 meters. Clad in
a dark shirt and black trousers, the person possessed a slightly stocky
build. Their nose bore a gentle curve, and their black hair fell in a
mid-length cascade.

Lumian's pupils dilated for a fleeting moment before swiftly returning
to their normal state.

A wisp of a smile tugged at the corners of his lips, and an invisible
fire seemed to ignite in his eyes.

Despite the adept disguise, Lumian would recognize him even if he were
reduced to ashes!

It was Guillaume Bénet, the padre of Cordu!

Lumian wrestled to contain his surprise, his gaze steering onward.

Simultaneously, his mind raced as he evaluated the next course of action
to undertake.

Before long, he reached the end of Rue Vincent.

At that very juncture, a parrot adorned with green and white feathers
took flight from Rue de la Muraille and perched itself on Lumian's
shoulder. It chirped excitedly, "We've located the target!"

*Located the target? Then who did I just see? Another padre?
*Lumian was momentarily flabbergasted and perplexed.

*Which one was the genuine Guillaume Bénet? Had he erred in judgment, or
had the Iron and Blood Cross Order and "Rat" Christo been
deceived?*

Fifteen minutes earlier, at the Dill Brothel on Rue de la Muraille.

Within the annex bar on the first floor, Albus savored his Lanti Proof
while discreetly observing the attendants, laborers, and the overseer
who managed the establishment.

His assessment encompassed the clientele as well, but it yielded nothing
of note. Many concealed their identities by donning assorted masks,
making it nearly impossible to unveil their true selves.

Having gained a preliminary insight into the inner workings of the Dill
Brothel, Albus seized the chance to make his way toward the washroom. He
veered onto the path leading to the kitchen when an attendant
approached, carrying a collection of post-it notes.

This attendant's responsibility encompassed recording the requirements
of each room and relaying orders to the kitchen.

Albus, marked by his dark-red hair, advanced and retrieved a handful of
glistening coins along with a substantial bundle of banknotes from his
pocket.

The attendant's features twisted into a blend of perplexity and
intrigue.

Albus smiled and said, "I'm on the hunt for a scoundrel. Uncertain about
his guise, I'm merely aware he shares your build and possesses a
penchant for consorting with the most celebrated ladies. Post-exertion,
he seeks sustenance to satiate his hunger immediately.

"If you're able to furnish me with the relevant particulars, all this is
yours."
