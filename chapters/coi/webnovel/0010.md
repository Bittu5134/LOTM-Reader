## Chapter 10: Blood

As Lumian stepped out the door, he felt as thought he was transported to
another world.

Before him lay no longer the familiar Cordu, but a dark-red mountain
peak and the collapsed buildings surrounding it. Together, they formed a
strange ruin.

The fog in the sky was thick and pale, making it difficult for light to
enter. The ground was shattered and there were many rocks. Lumian
gripped his axe tightly and inched forward carefully, his heart pounding
in his chest. Along the way, he couldn't find a place to hide.

There were no weeds or trees.

Lumian walked in fear, his every sense on high alert. All he could do
was hunch his back and comfort himself. At the very least, if there was
any danger in this area, it would be obvious at a glance. He could
discover it in advance.

Finally, he arrived at the ruins, a half-collapsed building that had
been wrecked by fire.

Lumian surveyed the area for a moment and tentatively confirmed that
there were no other creatures lurking about. Satisfied with his
assessment, he cautiously made his way inside the building, being
mindful of the charred wood that could fall at any moment from midair.

As he searched the room, his eyes landed on a broken pot in the corner
of the house. There was a hint of gold shining through the cracks.

Lumian approached the pot slowly and realized that it was a gold coin.

*Can it be true? There's actually treasure in the ruins of my
dream?* He picked up the gold coin and wiped it against his
body.

The patterns on the surface of the coin were revealed.

The coin featured a man's portrait carved on the front. His face was
thin, and his hair was parted 30-70. There was a mustache on his lips,
and his gaze was rather firm. On the back was a bunch of sweet iris
flowers surrounding the number 20.

Lumian recognized the man depicted on the coin. It was none other than
the first president of the Intis Republic, Levanx.

*It's actually a Louis d'or...* Lumian was rather surprised.

Firstly, he couldn't believe that the currency in this strange dream
ruin was actually the currency of the Intis Republic in reality. And
secondly, he had casually picked up something as valuable as a Louis
d'or.

He knew that in the present day, the legal currencies of the Intis
Republic were verl d'or and coppet. One verl d'or was equivalent to 100
coppet.

Coppet existed in the form of copper coins and silver coins. The copper
coins were divided into three categories: 1 coppet, 5 coppet, 10 coppet,
while the silver coins had the denominations of 20 coppet and 50 coppet.

Verl d'or could be found in the form of silver coins, gold coins, or
banknotes. In silver coins, there were denominations of 1, 5, and 10
verl d'or, while gold coins came in 5, 10, 20, 40, and 50 denominations.

The denominations of banknotes were even more varied, ranging from 5,
20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000 verl d'or.

In reality, the people of Intis still clung to the old currency units.
For example, the most widely used 5 coppet copper coins were known as
'lick.'

Similarly, gold coins worth 20 verl were commonly referred to as Louis
d'or.

In the old currency era, Louis d'or had been known as Roselle. But after
the Republic was established, the name was changed to Louis d'or in
order to erase Emperor Roselle's influence.

As Lumian understood it, even in the rural area of Cordu, a Louis d'or
could sustain a poor family with fields for an entire month.

He knew that without Aurore's high income, he might never have even seen
what a Louis d'or looked like. In fact, in the entire village of Cordu,
only the siblings and the family of the administrator had ever seen or
owned a Louis d'or.

To any villager, this Louis d'or was an incredibly valuable gain.

*Unfortunately, this is just a dream...* Lumian couldn't help
but feel a pang of disappointment.

This was something ordinary, making it unlikely he could "bring" it out
of the dream.

But even so, he handled the Louis d'or with great care and respect.
Having spent much of his life wandering, he knew the value of every
coppet.

And he knew that one Louis d'or was equivalent to 2,000 coppet, which
was equal to one gold pound in the Loen Kingdom, though slightly less.
According to the papers he had read, 24 verl d'or could only be
exchanged for one gold pound.

Lumian continued his search for any written information that could shed
light on the ruins and their history. He wanted to see if this place
corresponded to a certain location in reality, and whether a village in
the Intis Republic had been "transported" into this dream world. The
appearance of the Louis d'or had only fueled his curiosity.

As Lumian moved cautiously through the ruined building, his eyes fell
upon a spot where a stove had once stood, now stained with a dark-red
color.

"Blood?" His pupils dilated as he quickly made a guess.

Immediately after, he made a judgment.

Although it wasn't fresh, it hadn't yet turned black---it looked as
though it had just dripped there two or three days prior, or perhaps
even more recently!

As his heart began to race, Lumian suddenly felt the light around him
dim, as if something had silently blocked the light filtering through
the dense fog from above!

The memory of past attacks flooded Lumian's mind like a turbulent wave,
causing him to react instinctively.

Without a thought, he lunged forward and wrapped his body in midair,
rolling on the ground to avoid any potential danger.

*Thump!*

A loud thump echoed through the air as something heavy fell behind him.

Lumian quickly rolled to the left side of the dilapidated stove, using a
nearby rock to leverage himself around.

As he rose to his feet, axe at the ready, he saw an additional figure
standing where he had just been moments before.

The dim light made it difficult to discern whether it was human or some
kind of humanoid creature.

The figure hunched in front of Lumian was unlike anything he had ever
seen before. It was a monster, with no clothes or shoes to speak of. Its
skin had been peeled off, revealing the red muscles, blood vessels, and
yellowed fascia beneath. Sticky liquid dripped from its body, yet it
didn't fall to the ground.

It was a monster!

Its eyes seemed to be embedded in its face, and its mouth hung open with
all its might, revealing uneven teeth and a long drool of saliva.

Despite all the ghost stories Lumian had fabricated in the past, he
never expected to encounter such an evil spirit in real life.

*Whoosh!*

The stench of blood filled Lumian's nostrils as the panting of the
monster filled his ears.

Instinct took over Lumian as he dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding
the blood-red monster's attack.

Lumian knew that he had Aurore's guidance and years of experience
fighting on the streets to thank for his quick reflexes. Without them,
he might not have been able to react in time.

Taking a deep breath to calm himself, Lumian charged after the monster
that had pounced on him. With his sharp axe in hand, he swung with all
his might and struck the monster in the back.

*Bang!*

Lumian's axe felled the monster mid-turn, sending a spray of pus and
blood in every direction.

Without a moment's hesitation, Lumian knelt down on one knee and raised
his axe again, ready to strike another blow.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

Again and again, Lumian swung his axe with precision and force, each
strike slicing through the monster's flesh and leaving deep, wide cracks
on the back of its head, neck, and back.

Finally, the monster lay still, defeated by Lumian's fierce barrage of
blows.

"Huff! Puff! You don't act as terrifyingly as you look." Lumian heaved a
sigh of relief, his voice tinged with a hint of mockery.

He wiped his face with his left hand, then used it to wipe off the blood
on his other hand.

"Is this monster's bodily fluids poisonous? For the time being, there's
no pain of the fluids eating at me..." Lumian began to worry about
another problem.

Just as Lumian mustered up his courage and was about to search the
monster's body, he was caught off guard by a sudden movement. The
skinless, blood-colored monster propped itself up with both hands and
bounced up again, as if it were still alive.

*It isn't dead yet?*

Despite being slashed to such a state, it seemed that the monster was
still alive.

Lumian was shocked and afraid.

Fear and trepidation took hold of Lumian.

If Lumian had been facing normal humans, beasts, or monsters, he would
not have been so afraid, even if he couldn't defeat them. But this
monster in front of him seemed unkillable, rendering Lumian's every move
useless.

Taking advantage of the monster's brief disorientation, Lumian made a
quick decision. He propped himself up with his feet, exerted strength on
his knees, and ran wildly.

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*

He ran with all his might, but he could feel the monster's breath on the
back of his neck, and the sound of its heavy breathing echoed in his
ears.

The monster followed closely behind him.

Despite his fear, Lumian gritted his teeth and allowed his fear to push
himself

to run even faster, surpassing his previous limits.

To his delight, he soon realized that the distance between him and the
monster was no longer shortening.

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*

Lumian finally reached his semi-subterranean two-story building as he
pulled open the unlocked door and jumped inside.

With a loud clang, he slammed the door shut and quickly made his way to
the stove, where he picked up a steel fork that was leaning against the
wall.

Then he focused on the door.

But then, he heard the sound of the monster's running footsteps fading
away. He waited, but the monster didn't try to slam through the door.

*It knows that I'm lying in ambush here?* Lumian couldn't
believe that the monster had higher intelligence.

He slowly moved towards the window near the door and peeked out.

Suddenly, a face appeared on the glass---a bloody, skinless mess with
uneven teeth.

Lumian froze for a moment, his heart almost stopping.

To Lumian's surprise, the monster didn't try to break the glass or
attack him. Instead, it simply met his gaze.

Lumian snapped out of his daze and retreated, brandishing the long fork
with both hands.

The monster left the window.

Lumian watched cautiously, observing its movements as it lingered in the
light fog for a while before finally retreating back to the ruins.

Lumian was at a loss.

He had been prepared to trap the monster and make a quick escape from
the dream, but the creature had simply left without attacking.

After some thought, a possibility occurred to Lumian. *Perhaps the
monster is afraid to enter my house?*

*Yes, there's no signs of damage to the house at all...*

*In the dream, this is an absolutely safe place?*

With this realization, Lumian felt a sense of relief wash over him.

Lumian was hit with a wave of exhaustion the next second.

The short chase had taken more out of him than an entire afternoon of
combat training.

Lumian made his way upstairs to his bedroom, clutching the pitchfork and
axe tightly in his hands. As he lay down on the bed, Lumian attempted to
fall asleep.

†

Lumian opened his eyes, feeling disoriented and groggy.

Outside the curtains, it was still dark, and the room was shrouded in
shadows.

For a moment, Lumian couldn't tell if he was still in the dream world or
if he had somehow returned to reality. But then he noticed the lack of
gray fog and the fact that he was wearing his pajamas, and he realized
that he must have woken up.

"I woke up early because of the fright," Lumian muttered to himself,
subconsciously patting the pocket of his pajamas. But when he didn't
feel the weight of the Louis d'or, he felt a pang of disappointment.

It confirmed another fact---that money couldn't be brought out of the
dream world!

Lumian took a deep breath and composed himself, his thoughts turning to
a serious problem:

How was he supposed to deal with that unkillable monster?

While Lumian knew that he could bypass the area and enter stealthily, he
also knew that this was not a long-term solution. The possibility of
encountering similar monsters in the future was always there, and he
couldn't afford to risk his life by being unprepared.
