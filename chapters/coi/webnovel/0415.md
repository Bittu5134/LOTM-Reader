## Chapter 415: The Sinner Complains First

Quartier de la Cathédrale Commémorative, 11 Rue des Fontaines.

Gardner Martin, dressed in a crisp white shirt and black pants, stood
before the floor-to-ceiling windows in the Quartier de la Cathédrale
Commémorative. Bathed in golden sunlight, he listened intently as Lumian
and Christo shared the details of their encounter with the Trier Cave
Association.

Lumian took the lead, briefly explaining the origins of the Earth Blood
ore specimen.

"While I was staying at Auberge du Coq Doré, I crossed paths with a man
named Flameng, a Lunatic who had a tragic encounter with the Montsouris
ghost, leading to the bizarre deaths of his family.

"Occasionally, he regained lucidity. We drank together a few times. One
day, he hanged himself. His belongings, including the Earth Blood ore
specimen, ended up with the police. They said they were to hand them
over to his surviving relatives, but they refused to accept them.
Eventually, they asked me to retrieve them, which included the Earth
Blood ore specimen.

"I knew that lunatic and had drinks with him. I didn't throw away the
mineral specimen and casually placed it in an iron cabinet of my safe
house..."

Lumian spoke the truth, not a single word being false. He only concealed
the fact that he had helped Flameng escape the Montsouris ghost and
Termiboros's reminder regarding the Earth Blood ore.

Gardner Martin, his brownish-red eyes reflecting wisdom and a touch of
silver hair in his black hair, inquired, "Where is your safe house?"

Lumian replied honestly, "It's in the leftmost room on the third floor
of 19 Rue des Blouses Blanches."

This wasn't on the same side as Apartment 6, which had emitted a
terrifying aura, and there was a distance between them, so Lumian's
answer was straightforward.

Gardner Martin smiled.

"No wonder you frequent Rue des Blouses Blanches so often. It's not just
because of Jenna."

*Boss, are you hinting at me not to visit Franca too often? Are you
implying that you're aware of this situation?* Lumian grumbled
and continued.

He gave the same story he had told Joseph and Rayan from the Cave
Association.

Finally, Lumian subtly probed, "Will this pose a problem for our Savoie
Mob? There might be an official faction hidden behind the Cave
Association."

He wanted to convey to Gardner Martin that his cover in front of Poufer
Sauron might be at risk, trusting the boss's intelligence to grasp the
implication.

Gardner Martin gave a slight nod and turned his attention to "Rat"
Christo, saying, "If you want to join the Cave Association, you can, but
ensure it doesn't interfere with our smuggling operations."

Christo nodded repeatedly.

"Understood, Boss."

Following Gardner Martin's instructions, he departed from the study,
leaving Lumian alone.

Gardner Martin smiled and consoled the official member of the Iron and
Blood Cross Order.

"Don't worry about Poufer. Even if he figures out your true identity,
he'll pretend he doesn't know. Ever since you became the king in the
King's Pie game, he's been suspicious of you. He'll definitely probe and
exploit you again and again."

It was a subtle message, urging Lumian to remain in the market district
and continue overseeing Salle de Bal Brise, Auberge du Coq Doré, Salle
de Gristmill, and other businesses.

Lumian couldn't help but smile with relief. "Alright, I was just worried
that it would affect the most important mission."

Simultaneously, he sneered inwardly.

He keenly felt the irrationality of Gardner Martin's plan.

Transitioning control to another Beyonder to oversee Salle de Bal Brise
and other operations, allowing Lumian to slip into the shadows, was a
straightforward task for the boss of the Savoie Mob and the Commanding
Officer of the Iron and Blood Cross Order. There were no downsides to
this arrangement.

Even though he couldn't afford to mistreat Lumian, a subordinate on an
important mission, he could compensate him by continuing to share the
profits from Salle de Bal Brise and other businesses. He couldn't risk
keeping an official member, who had already attracted suspicion, in his
current location.

While Lumian's retreat into the shadows might make him appear even more
suspicious, potentially putting the Savoie Mob in the crosshairs,
Gardner Martin had encountered such challenges numerous times before.
There had to be a solution.

Sensing the Commanding Officer of the Iron and Blood Cross Order's
suspicion, Lumian aimed to use the Cave Association to keep testing him.

His account and explanations were entirely truthful. Normally, Gardner
Martin would believe him, but the issue was that too many unusual events
had occurred around him recently. As a former or current Conspirer,
Gardner Martin would instinctively smell something fishy.

The detailed reasons were no longer enough to hide the overall
abnormality.

With this thought in mind, Lumian's determination to kill surged.

He stared at Gardner Martin, positioned by the floor-to-ceiling windows,
and estimated the distance between them to be about five meters.

At such a close range, if he were to suddenly employ the Spell of
Harrumph, and Gardner Martin hadn't reached Sequence 4 and achieved
godhood, lacking a mystical item to defend against such abilities, he
could quickly subdue the Savoie Mob boss and eliminate him.

The current situation resembled that of two ordinary individuals without
Beyonder powers standing within a five-meter radius. One held a high
social status and excelled in combat, while the other held a low status
and lacked physical strength. However, they both concealed a revolver
and possessed exceptional marksmanship.

Within five meters, regardless of an ordinary person's status or combat
skills, they would succumb to a single shot!

Considering the missions for the Tarot Club and the Aurora Order, Lumian
composed himself and inquired, "Commanding Officer, I wish to purchase
the Conspirer potion formula from the Order."

He had gained valuable insights from his advancement to Pyromaniac. He
didn't want to go through the nerve-wracking process of searching for
each Conspirer potion ingredient after digesting the Pyromaniac potion.
His goal was to gather Conspirer ingredients in advance while continuing
to digest the remaining Pyromaniac potion, thereby maximizing his time
efficiency.

Gardner Martin responded with surprise, "Do you have that much cash for
that?

"The Conspirer potion formula can command prices ranging from 70,000 to
80,000 verl d'or at the most mysticism gatherings, if not more. It's
unlike Pyromaniacs, who are constantly perishing as others advance.
Conspirers understand the importance of self-preservation, and they've
become more cautious about sharing their Sequence potion formulas."

In Trier, the most common potion formulas available ranged from Sequence
9 to Sequence 7 of the Hunter pathway.

Without waiting for Lumian's reply, Gardner Martin grinned and added,
"If you can unearth even a portion of the Sauron family's decline
secret, I'll reward you with the Conspirer potion formula. It doesn't
have to be the whole story, just a piece of the puzzle."

"If you're eager to advance and don't want to wait, as an official
member of the Iron and Blood Cross Order, you have the privilege of
purchasing the Conspirer potion formula at a discounted price of 60,000
verl d'or."

Lumian agreed without hesitation, "No problem. I'll bring 60,000 verl
d'or tomorrow."

His initial plan had been to inquire with Mr. K and Madam Magician if
Gardner Martin declined his request.

"Do you really have 60,000 verl d'or?" Gardner Martin chuckled.

Lumian's heart raced as he replied deliberately, "Just about. I
previously assisted a tenant of Auberge du Coq Doré in recovering a
100,000 debt owed by Salle de Bal Unique on Rue Ancienne in Quartier de
l'Observatoire. I took a bit over half of it."

In total, he had received 50,000 verl d'or in banknotes and gold, worth
30,000 verl d'or. After repaying Franca's 25,000, he had 55,000 left.
Combined with the original 1,000 gold, 1,000 banknotes, and 4,000 verl
d'or, he had 61,000 verl d'or in liquid assets.

"Salle de Bal Unique..." Gardner Martin repeated, his expression growing
more serious. "You really managed to retrieve the debt from Salle de Bal
Unique?"

Evidently, the Commanding Officer of the Iron and Blood Cross Order was
familiar with Salle de Bal Unique.

Lumian nodded, his demeanor open and honest.

"Yes."

The members of the Savoie Mob at Salle de Bal Brise were more or less
aware that he had helped Fitz collect his debt. Lumian couldn't keep
Gardner Martin in the dark, so he decided to disclose it directly to
confuse the situation and divert the Iron and Blood Cross Order's
suspicions.

Furthermore, he could use this opportunity to put a little fear into
Gardner Martin!

Gardner Martin scrutinized Lumian and subtly moved closer to the
floor-to-ceiling windows.

After a few moments, he inquired with curiosity, "Have you never heard
of the issues surrounding Salle de Bal Unique?"

"I have," Lumian replied with a smile.

If he had a monocle, he might have playfully inserted it into his right
eye socket at that moment, savoring Gardner Martin's intriguing
expressions and subconscious reactions.

After a pause, Lumian continued, "After accepting the commission, I
conducted a thorough investigation of the dance hall and realized it
wasn't as simple as it seemed. It had a mysterious background and posed
a significant danger, so I initially decided to abandon it. However, one
day, while trailing an adversary, I noticed something unusual. One of
the guards at Salle de Bal Unique's entrance had inexplicably vanished.
And upstairs, behind a window, their boss, Timmons, appeared to have
lost his spirit.

"I saw this as an opportunity, so I made an attempt to enter and collect
the debt. To my surprise, I succeeded!"

As Lumian spoke, he took a step forward and asked earnestly, "Commanding
Officer, are there any hidden dangers I should be aware of?"

Gardner Martin discreetly took another step forward and smiled.

"Not at the moment. Keep an eye out for any future anomalies."

Lumian seized the opportunity to express his bewilderment.

"Commanding Officer, something doesn't quite add up. Why have there been
so many events swirling around me lately? Some I initiated, while others
just seemed to find their way to me. Am I truly a harbinger of trouble?
Or has my recent fate been to rush around and handle things, leaving me
constantly busy and weary?"

Gardner Martin regarded him with meaning and replied, "Perhaps, this is
the destiny that every Hunter is bound to face."

After Lumian departed, Gardner Martin shifted his gaze to the side.

A hidden door creaked open, and Supervisor Olson emerged, bearing a
resemblance to a hungry bear.

"How is it?" Gardner Martin inquired.

Olson smirked and responded, "It's natural for him to be discontent with
your arrangements. His loyalty isn't firmly established yet. He won't be
able to join your team for the time being."

Gardner Martin shifted the conversation thoughtfully.

"The calamity on him is more conspicuous than any of us. Is it possible
that he's more compatible?"

Olson fell silent for a few moments before replying, "Let's observe and
wait."

Meanwhile, as Lumian returned to the market district, Franca sat at
Trocadéro's Red House Café. Her gaze fell upon Browns Sauron, her long,
flowing orange-red hair resembling a waterfall, as she asked, "When will
you folks complete the audit?"

Browns Sauron didn't provide a direct response. She studied Franca, who
had black hair and brown eyes, for a moment before saying, "We've
identified a suspected member of the Bliss Society."
