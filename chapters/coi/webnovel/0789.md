## Chapter 789: At the Stake

Jenna observed Rabbit Chasel, who increasingly resembled Gehrman
Sparrow, and carefully asked, "What do you need this time?"

*One of the later volumes of The Great Adventurer? Or something
else?*

Luckily, few people knew about her messenger, and Rabbit Chasel didn't
deliver messages frequently. Otherwise, Jenna would have to consider
providing different knowledge.

Rabbit Chasel lowered its paw holding the revolver and said in a
thoughtful tone, "Get me a pair of boxing gloves that a rabbit can
wear."

*What kind of request is that?* Lumian said with a chuckle, "I
don't remember Gehrman Sparrow ever wearing boxing gloves."

*This imitation doesn't quite fit the persona!*

"True, but Gehrman Sparrow has Blazing Danitz. I need my own Danitz. I
want to develop one in our community," Rabbit Chasel explained
earnestly. "Danitz uses boxing gloves."

For a moment, Franca, Jenna, and Lumian didn't know how to respond.

After several seconds, Jenna nodded and said, "I'll have a pair
custom-made for you. Mm, normal Rabbit of Knowledge size, not your
size?"

"That's right." Rabbit Chasel raised its right hand, blew on the small
revolver's muzzle, satisfied.

*But... this gesture isn't fitting for the current scene...*
Franca noticed that Rabbit Chasel was still an immature Rabbit of
Knowledge, mimicking and repeating much without truly mastering it.

In the darkness of Banamo Port, only a few street lamps with candles
flickered. Pirates gathered in bars, drinking heavily or going upstairs
with women, enjoying pleasures unavailable at sea.

With the Newins gone and the unknown adventurer disappeared, the pirates
gradually put the incident behind them. After all, everyone felt
embarrassed; no one would ridicule another.

As pirates, they knew they might die in a storm, during a robbery, or in
a mutiny on their next voyage. Dwelling on past problems was
meaningless; indulging in the present was the only option.

Of course, they also talked about the unknown adventurer's strength and
what had happened inside the Newins, wondering why Admiral Deep Sea fled
in such a hurry.

"I think that adventurer was waiting for Admiral Deep Sea!"

"Does he want to recreate Gehrman Sparrow's great feats?"

"Pui! Son of a bitch. What great feats? We're pirates!"

"He succeeded but didn't completely succeed? He defeated Admiral Deep
Sea but let him escape?"

"Is he close to the power of the Kings?"

"What's happening on the sea? Every so often, a powerful adventurer
appears! There was that Louis Berry before, too."

"..."

Disguised as a non-pirate, Mason mingled in several bars, listening to
the pirates discuss recent events, hoping they'd start a fight.

On his way to the next bar, Mason turned into a quieter alley and saw a
figure standing ahead, seemingly waiting for him.

The figure had black hair and blue eyes, with sharp features and a
handsome face. It was the same unknown adventurer who had challenged all
the pirates in Banamo Port and forced Admiral Deep Sea to flee.

Mason suddenly heard his heart pounding and blurted out, "I'm not a
pirate!"

Lumian strolled forward and smiled. "I have a task for you."

Hearing this, Mason relaxed a bit and carefully said, "What can I do for
you? I'm not sure if my abilities can meet your needs."

He feared that while completing the task might be easy, the aftermath
could be problematic---pirates might hack him to pieces once the
adventurer left.

Lumian said bluntly, "It's a simple and secret task. Keep an eye on
Banamo Port. As soon as the Newins returns or you spot Great Shark Jörg
and his men, summon my messenger immediately."

Hearing "messenger," Mason was suddenly struck by a thought.

He remembered his last task: summoning a terrifying messenger through a
ritual!

Unable to control his expression, Mason asked in slight terror, "Are you
Lumian Lee, sir?"

*The master of that terrifying messenger?*

"Perceptive," Lumian replied, not too sincerely.

Mason connected the recent events in his mind: *Was the real purpose of
that task to bring Lumian Lee to Banamo Port?*

*And Lumian Lee's goal was to deal with Admiral Deep Sea, Howl
Constantine, for the Lost Newins?*

*My spiritual intuition was partly correct; the ritual indeed brought
something bad to Banamo Port, though it didn't turn into a
catastrophe...*

Lumian continued, "The payment is 5000 verl d'or."

*The task is indeed simple, and I likely wouldn't be discovered by the
pirates. The reward is generous... If I refused, knowing the task
details might bring trouble...* After weighing it for over ten
seconds, Mason said, "No problem, I think I can handle this task."

Lumian nodded slightly, paid a 1000-verl d'or deposit, and turned to
leave the quiet alley.

Watching Lumian's figure disappear into the darkness, Mason silently
repeated his name, "Lumian Lee, Lumian Lee..."

Mason finally remembered where he had heard the name: on a wanted poster
aboard a ship!

The poster described Lumian Lee as a survivor of a sacrificial ritual to
an evil god that destroyed a village, severely corrupted by the evil
god.

In Trier, in the prison district, at the Rois Comprehensive Execution
Ground.

Returning to Trier for two days, Franca, feeling ready for the Demoness
of Affliction advancement ritual, decided to proceed.

007's lead on the Mirror People came from a mineralogist of the Trier
Cave Association. The Purifiers had planned to investigate all the
association's mineralogists, but one had mysteriously disappeared before
they could visit. Recently, someone had seen her---the mineralogist
Jasmine but suspected to be Palia, a Mirror Person---in Underground
Trier.

Franca looked at the stake and sighed sincerely, "When I became a witch,
I wondered if I'd end up burned at the stake. Who knew, I have to tie
myself up here."

As she spoke, she took out the brown-red wooden suitcase given by
Demoness of Black Clarice from the Traveler's Bag and unlocked the metal
clasp.

Next, she retrieved a red wine glass, crushed the crystalline ice
containing potion ingredients, and poured in Flower-Faced Bat blood and
human blood from a seriously ill person. Both were dark red, and when
combined, they turned almost black.

She then added the Flower-Faced Bat's head, a Two-Tailed Black Snake's
gallbladder and tail tip, and ten drops of Enfinitas Eucalyptus
essential oil.

As the ingredients were added, the dark red blood in the glass turned
pitch black, with occasional nauseating green bubbles.

"It's like a cup of untreated sewage," Lumian commented honestly.

"Dammit! Shut up!" Franca grew more disgusted as she looked at the
Demoness of Affliction potion.

She handed the potion to Lumian and lightly jumped onto the stake, tying
herself up with Jenna's help.

During this, Franca muttered, "Damn, this feels so weird..."

She adjusted her mindset for several seconds and nodded to Lumian, "I'm
ready."

Lumian handed the potion to Jenna and extended his right palm.

A ball of crimson-white flames flew out, landing on Franca, who
immediately felt pain. Her body instinctively wanted to dodge and
contract, but the ropes held her firmly.

Jenna quickly jumped to her side, one hand holding the ropes and the
other bringing the potion to her mouth.

Franca forced herself to gulp down the pathogen-like dark-green potion.

Whether from the flames or the potion, her head quickly grew hot, and
her mind became fuzzy from the heat.

She involuntarily recalled past pleasures, including her own experiences
and the feedback from her partners.

At that moment, Franca was both the giver and receiver of pleasure,
drowning in it from body to soul, almost dissolving like spring water.

Her thoughts drifted, her will sank, and her self was lost in various
intense pleasures.

However, the pain accompanying those pleasures kept her slightly
conscious. It was the mental resistance and spiritual conflict with
Gardner Martin, the emotional gap with Jenna, as if they could never
truly unite body and soul...

The extreme pain from the burning flames on her body was like invisible
threads pulling her self and consciousness, making her sway like a kite
in a storm, not completely out of control.

Swaying, Franca instinctively cursed in her mind:

*Damn, it hurts so much!*

*This ritual is trying to kill me, isn't it?*

*Cough, cough, hot smoke in my throat and lungs, so uncomfortable. Am I
dying...*

*Dammit, I can say I smell good now, like food, the scent of roasted
meat...*

Lumian, Jenna, and Anthony stood before the stake, watching Franca's
body gradually turn black and her expression twist beyond beauty.

Even Lugano, ready to provide medical help, felt a bit heated, their
minds wandering with certain thoughts and urges.

Facing this horrifying scene, they had inappropriate desires.

Fortunately, it wasn't severe and was bearable.

After several more seconds, the crimson flames on Franca's body turned
pitch black, then into crystalline ice shards, falling off in pieces.

The shards took the charred skin with them, revealing Franca's new,
tender, and glistening skin underneath.

Even with his Ascetic's endurance, Lumian instinctively looked away.
