## Chapter 1162: A Distant Planet

As the planet was torn into fragments in an instant, the three-headed,
three-bodied, six-armed Lumian remained completely unaffected.

How could calamity itself ever be harmed by Disaster?

At some unknown point, he had already taken out the Box of the Great Old
Ones, encrusted with various gemstones, and directly opened its third
layer.

Inside, there was nothing---yet clear and unnerving sounds of chewing
and digestion emanated from within.

Almost simultaneously, the right hand of the body housing Aurore and
Jenna reached inside, pulling from the void a mass of chaotic liquid
that contained all colors and all possibilities.

Then, that hand clenched into a fist, absorbing the liquid into a chaos
vortex it created. It annihilated the contents within, incorporating
them into Lumian's own consciousness and spirit, specifically into the
feminine aspect of the Origins of Disaster, thus balancing the residual
corruption that could not be entirely eradicated.

As Lumian performed this action, a massive cross above the protective
zones caused an even larger tide of chaos to surge forth, engulfing the
zone completely.

The next moment, the terrifying gravitational pull of the immense star
cluster and the disintegration of the fragmented planet caused the
protective zones and the Chaos Sea that submerged it to tremble
violently, as if on the brink of total collapse. The massive cross began
to bend noticeably.

Yet, no matter what, the protective zones remained stable---for the time
being, at least.

*Now!*

Klein felt the Great Old Dominators rushing to breach the barrier.
Seizing the opportunity, he directed the projection of the bluish-black
door of light into the protective zones, where it scattered into
countless starlit fragments.

The Chaos Sea enveloping the protective zone abruptly contracted,
retreating back into the shadowy figure on the cross. All that remained
was a patch of deep darkness and a few dangerous artifacts.

The protective zones vanished.

They disappeared entirely.

Lord of Mysteries Klein instantly transferred billions of humans,
countless other species, and the scenes from the dream to a target
planet at the edge of the universe.

It was like a magician's trick---drape a cloth over the table, then whip
it away, and the objects underneath were gone.

†

Within the protective zone, still functioning but with only five minutes
left, The Magician Fors, standing in her home in Backlund, suddenly
froze for a moment.

She said to Xio, Franca, Anthony, and Ludwig, "There's no need for me to
transfer you anymore. We've already reached our destination. Everyone
has."

"Uh..." Franca was stunned.

She had thought she would still have one final chance to make a
decision.

It wasn't until Madam Magician finished speaking that she, Madam
Judgment Xio, Ludwig, and the others realized the environment around
them had already changed.

At that moment, The Magician Fors frowned slightly and said, "Enemies
are approaching---from space!"

As she spoke, Fors stretched out her right hand. With a burst of
dazzling starlight, she conjured a fantastical screen in front of her.

On the screen were shadowy figures traversing different dimensions, as
well as faint, unattainably high humanoid shapes, leaping toward the
current planet.

*Sequence 2 Dimensional Shadow and Sequence 1 Observer of the Painter
pathway... and there's more than one of them... Have they discovered Mr.
Fool's transfer of the protective zones and seen through the Deceit,
locating this planet from a higher dimension and sending their
Blessed?* While Madam Magician Fors's consciousness resonated,
the figures, however, did not directly descend into the current
dimension. They stopped instead.

They understood that relying solely on Their angelic powers would not be
enough to deal with the numerous and powerful "prey."

They began summoning Visitors, seeking reinforcements.

This was Their habit. They were not mindless creatures driven by
instinct to hunt recklessly without considering alliances.

The next second, one grotesque creature after another arrived through
Hostels.

Some were women with closed eyes, weaving webs of fate; others wielded
illusory, silvery dirks that seemed capable of severing the threads of
fate and cutting off branches of the River of Fate.

Some belonged to different species, appearing humanoid or bizarre. All
had three heads and six arms, with expressions ranging from malice and
rage to sorrowful numbness, compassionate serenity, or blank
incompleteness.

Some were radiant beings of starlight with six pairs of wings, while
others were colossal transparent dragons, attempting to drive a small
asteroid toward the planet at the edge of the universe.

Others were draped in black robes, revealing only writhing snakes or
tentacles beneath. Still others had no physical form, existing only as
whispers deep within living beings' hearts.

Some wore fresh flower wreaths, appearing beautiful, holding wooden bows
and arrows like true deities. Others resembled tree-like sea monsters,
covered in slimy blossoms and chaos-slick scales, dotted with
brown-green tumors.

There were beings that looked like dark vortices, filled with gleaming
white teeth and tendrils of shadow extending outward, crowned with
disparate heads. Others were blobs of liquid containing all colors.

Some seemed composed of water-colored time, Their massive forms slowing
everything around Them. Others were hunched, ancient to the point of
decrepitude, with loose, wrinkled skin blotched with decay. Aside from
Their mountainous size, They appeared unremarkable.

Some stood loftily, as if holding up the sky itself to prevent it from
collapsing, yet Their abdomens were entirely hollow. Others resembled
immense greenish oak trees that seemed to pierce the heavens...

Upon seeing this scene, The Madam Magician Fors's mind was suddenly
flooded with information, drawn from Mr. Fool, Ma'am Hermit, The Chariot
Lumian the Chariot, and her own explorations.

*Sequence 2 Web Weaver and Sequence 1 Blade of Fate of the Goddess of
Fate pathway...*

*Sequence 2 Sinner and Sequence 1 Angel of Redemption of the Circle of
Inevitability pathway...*

*Sequence 2 Radiant Angel and Sequence 1 Star Dragon of the Tide Scholar
pathway...*

*Sequence 2 Great Old One Attendant and Sequence 1 Voice of the Heart,
of the Initiator pathway...*

*Sequence 2 Cupid and Sequence 1 Leviathan of the Mother Tree of Desire
pathway...*

*Sequence 2 Angel of Devouring and Sequence 1 Chaos Gastric Juices of
the Chef pathway...*

*Sequence 2 Time Giant and Sequence 1 God of Decay of the Monarch of
Decay pathway...*

*Sequence 2 The Supreme or Broken Pillar and Sequence 1 Tree God of the
Heretic Spellmaster pathway...*

Madam Magician took a deep breath, turned her head, and smiled at
Judgment Xio. "It's not over yet. We still have work to do."

Having spoken, the recently advanced Sequence 1 Key of Stars stepped out
of the protective zone and appeared above the habitable planet she had
discovered during her previous travels.

She raised her right hand, unveiling a vast and dreamlike starry sky to
cover the entire protective zone, sealing it in a defensive barrier.

The coming battle could not be allowed to affect the interior of the
protective zone, nor could those evil god Blessed infiltrate it!

No sooner had Fors finished this task than another figure appeared
nearby---the Pope of the Church of Evernight, Saint Dabomachie.

Saint Dabomachie, now transformed into a giant dozens of meters tall
with elongated limbs, grayish-blue skin, and a single vertical eye on
His forehead,

had ascended to Sequence 1 Hand of God in the Warrior pathway. His right
hand seemed to be made entirely of glowing orange twilight.

Summoning pure, dense light imbued with orange hues, Saint Dabomachie
added another layer of unyielding radiance outside Fors's seal.

Double protection!

As Saint Dabomachie wielded His protective power, yet another figure
emerged from the protective zone.

This was a black-haired, blue-eyed middle-aged man with a stern
demeanor, square face, and high nose, cloaked in a dark mantle: William
Augustus, the founder of the Loen Kingdom.

William Augustus did not act immediately. He raised His head to observe
the tug-of-war between disorder and balance, the evolving order of the
battlefield, and the enemy forces' formation, carefully calculating the
rules and structures He would impose.

Such decisions could not afford errors. If situations like "Mystery
weakens here, while reality grows stronger" were imposed, and the enemy
deployed something akin to the ship used in the sea prayer ritual, those
very rules might end up limiting their own side's Angels.

The Magician Fors, about to speak to Saint Dabomachie and William
Augustus, saw Xio and Franca appear beside her.

Meeting her gaze, Judgment Xio said calmly, "For me, establishing and
maintaining order is fundamentally about protection."

Fors smiled but said nothing. Instead, she turned to Franca.

Franca cleared her throat and replied solemnly, "I'm not the type to
hide behind others.

"At a time like this, every bit of strength counts. Every bit of light
helps."

Given her personality, how could she not have fantasized about being a
savior---the kind who signed non-disclosure agreements and remained
unsung after the fact?

Madam Magician laughed. "Even if you didn't come, I would've summoned
you."

Then, through the seal and barriers, she addressed Anthony within the
protective zone, "Your job is to Placate and maintain stability."

Anthony hesitated briefly before turning to Ludwig and saying, "I'll
handle the Trier area."

Without waiting for a response, he entered the sea of collective
subconscious.

His expression was heavy, yet tinged with joy.

*How wonderful. This time, I can do something. I can placate. I can
stabilize the rear for the Angels.*

*Back then, it may have been naive and laughable, but I didn't join the
army for wealth or status---I did it to protect my country and its
people...*

Ludwig neither followed Anthony nor immediately left the protective
zone. Instead, he now held a jewelry box encrusted with countless
gemstones and a writhing blob of chaotic liquid.

From across half the universe, Lumian had hurled the Box of the Great
Old Ones to him.

Staring at the two items, Ludwig's expression fluctuated.

After a few seconds, he gritted his teeth and swallowed the chaotic
liquid.
