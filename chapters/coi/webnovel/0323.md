## Chapter 323: Psychological Profile

Lumian stood at an intersection, his hands casually tucked into his
pockets as he strolled leisurely toward Rue de la Muraille.

This street held more significance to the people of Trier than even the
renowned Avenue du Boulevard. It was their aspiration.

In the days before Emperor Roselle ignited the Industrial Revolution,
Trier's cityscape hadn't sprawled to the extent it had now. It nestled
in the easternmost corner, fortified by stout city walls and vigilantly
guarded by soldiers. Their military encampment wasn't distant, which
prompted the emergence of numerous brothels and prostitutes nearby.

As the sands of time sifted through, Rue de la Muraille garnered its
reputation, and Trier's population burgeoned. A modest market burgeoned
into a realm of prestige and extravagance that stretched across the
Northern and Southern Continents.

Lumian passed beneath the sheltering canopy of Intis parasol trees, his
gaze taking in opulent palace-like structures alongside unassuming
apartments. They all shared a common trait---windows adorned with
frosted glass and the occasional green shutter.

Rue de la Muraille appeared to be rousing from its midday slumber. The
road hosted few pedestrians, but each one bore a distinct air. Some
dashed by in somber gray-blue work attire, driven by haste, while others
donned antiquated finery. They glanced around before slipping into
apartment complexes. Cameras slung around necks captured candid moments
before these wanderers vanished into ornate edifices. Attempts at
projecting an Intisian facade couldn't mask true identities, betrayed by
hairlines and exaggerated heights.

Moreover, Lumian's keen eye caught sight of an iron-gray robot, towering
at two meters. A steam-spewing outlet adorned its back, accompanied by
gears, torsion springs, screws, and bent pipes---a symphony of
decorative mechanics.

Perched on the robot's left shoulder, a lavishly dressed man flaunted
intricate makeup. His leisurely observation spanned pedestrians,
dignitaries shrouded in gold or silver masks, and groggy men stumbling
into wakefulness.

Here, the ordinary and elite intertwined in a peculiar harmony.

As Lumian advanced, he methodically surveyed his surroundings, his gaze
unrelenting in its pursuit of his target.

In a flash, he spotted Albus approaching from a side alley.

The Iron and Blood Cross Order member, sporting dark-red locks,
acknowledged Lumian with a sly grin. He lifted his right hand, pointed
at his own head---provocation in motion.

Under Gardner Martin's directive, Albus was tasked with tracking down
Padre Guillaume Bénet. It seemed Albus was insinuating a competition of
sorts, pitting Lumian against himself to see who'd uncover the "prey"
first.

Beyond Albus, the Iron and Blood Cross Order likely deployed several
official or peripheral affiliates. In this, Gardner Martin had kept his
promises.

Undeterred by Albus's gesture, Lumian pressed on, deeper into Rue de la
Muraille.

Guided by the revelations of Demoness of Pleasure Franca's Magic Mirror
Divination, the prophecy's domain narrowed:

Guillaume Bénet's presence was expected on five streets, including Rue
de la Muraille and Rue du Cheval Blanc, within the week.

However, Rue de la Muraille's length, its expanse, and the thronging
populace created a nebulous landscape for Lumian's quest. Carpet
searches and widespread net-casting was virtually impossible. Success
hinged on the possibility of enlisting aid from the authorities and
mustering an army to seal off this domain, vigilantly guarding every
entrance to Underground Trier.

Previously, Lumian could only hope that the Iron and Blood Cross Order,
a secret organization teeming with formidable Hunters, boasted superior
tracking and manhunt techniques. Or perhaps, Termiboros---an
Inevitability Angel---might drive them to converge. As long as the
distance between Lumian and Guillaume Bénet was moderate, they would
"reunite" as though preordained.

However, a new trail had emerged.

This advancement was predominantly the fruit of the mystical knowledge
he had acquired as a Contractee!

Within this trove of knowledge lay a menagerie of uncanny creatures,
summonable or recruitable, complete with the requisite costs for forging
contracts. The compendium detailed the abilities obtainable and the
subsequent penalties incurred post-contract.

Merging the exhibition of Guillaume Bénet's contractual capabilities
from his memory and dream, Lumian pieced together a fragment of insight:

*Summoning Abyss Demon Flowers necessitates a sacrifice of fresh human
blood. The downside---an increased desire for coitus.*

*Invisibility mandates thirteen portions of prepared meat. The
downside---an intensified susceptibility to hunger.*

*Slow Flight sacrifices one's romantic infatuation perpetually. The
downside---an urge to show off.*

*Bone Curse predicates the sacrifice of a living person. The
downside---drowsiness.*

*The Soul Assimilation Mystic Spell exacts no fewer than three human
souls. The downside---random bouts of dizziness, numbering four to five
daily.*

*Internal Explosion demands the sacrifice of any Beyonder
characteristic. The downside---unrelenting spirituality drain,
tantamount to permanent reduction of spirituality capacity.*

From the detailed description of the Soul Assimilation Mystic Spell,
Lumian conjectured that the padre had inadvertently met an additional,
covert cost.

That was his name!

The Soul Assimilation Mystic Spell affected the target's Spirit Body by
invocating their true name, causing them to experience dizziness and
other reactions, amplified by deeper comprehension of the target and
employment of verbiage echoing the spirit world.

In contracting with a spirit world entity armed with the Soul
Assimilation Mystic Spell, Guillaume Bénet inadvertently disclosed his
true name. Entities endowed with such powers could wield a person's true
name for manifold feats---a potentially profound latent hazard.

This clandestine peril was merely one amid numerous akin enigmas housed
within a Contractee's mystic wisdom. Therefore, Lumian opted for an
extensive screen of spirit world creatures, personal interaction
followed by experimental engagement.

Based upon the known downsides accompanying the contracted abilities,
Lumian hatched an educated hypothesis.

After Guillaume Bénet, a man driven by insatiable desires, found his
appetite for sex surging, he had definitely sought out women. The
prophecy's alignment with Quartier de la Princesse Rouge harmonized with
the results unearthed from the Magic Mirror Divination about the five
nearby streets.

Furthermore, he found his hunger more voracious than ever, and the act
of intimacy left him drained of vigor. Thus, the likelihood was high
that he would gravitate towards a brothel that catered to both carnal
and culinary needs or invite a woman back home.

Guillaume Bénet was not only a man of fervent desires but also an
ambitious soul, thirsting for power. Being confined in the village and
before the contractual abilities imbued his life with adverse effects,
his lust mirrored an expression of power. Otherwise, it was impossible
to explain how his desires sprawled across every woman, an inclination
spanning the spectrum between esteemed paramours and those of lesser
stature.

To him, appropriating the companions of other men became a testament to
his standing, might, and allure.

Stepping onto Trier's soil, a place where his provincial accent drew
disdain from the citizens, he undoubtedly sought vindication,
manifesting his claims in his own unique manner.

Fused with his relentless pursuit of strength and his past style,
Guillaume Bénet very likely went after sought-after courtesans, stoking
the fires of envy amongst the local denizens. He might even spirit one
or two of these coveted women away to grace his home.

This comprehensive analysis of the padre's character and psyche wasn't
Lumian's solitary undertaking. Rather, it emerged from the expertise of
Anthony Reid, a Psychiatrist. Armed with Lumian's intricate portrayal of
Guillaume Bénet, Reid painted a psychological canvas, a vivid portrait
of this heretic's inner workings.

Thus, two distinct paths unfurled to ensnare his prey. The first
entailed staking out upscale brothels, where both meals and famous
courtesans awaited. The other trail veered towards investigations
surrounding courtesans who had entered matrimony, taken on mistress
roles, or even vanished within the past two months.

For the former pursuit, the mantle rested upon the shoulders of the Iron
and Blood Cross Order. Lumian's current task revolved around unearthing
a conduit to intelligence about Rue de la Muraille's clandestine tales.

Anthony Reid, an adept intelligence broker, held a key. He was
well-acquainted with Bühler, a Ghost Face columnist renowned for
exposing scandals and whispers that wove through the fabric of Rue de la
Muraille.

Bühler, a connoisseur of drinking and writing, would frequent a corner
of Hope Café where he could survey the entrance before venturing into
the brothels.

With his objective clear, Lumian embarked on a steady stride toward the
café nestled amidst Rue de la Muraille.

En route, he revisited the entirety of the task at hand, stirred by an
indescribable emotion.

His divination capabilities paled in comparison to Franca's. A lone
Prophecy Spell rested in his arsenal, a tool he dared not wield
recklessly. The finesse of Anthony Reid's psychological profiling and
information-gathering expertise dwarfed Lumian's own. However,
mobilizing these allies allowed him to harness these strengths, akin to
gaining possession of these abilities.

Lumian couldn't foretell the ramifications of ascending to godhood. Yet,
one thing was certain: beneath Sequence 4, one's prowess met
constraints. Cooperative squads harnessed the potential for synergy,
enabling them to confront even higher Sequences sans those with godhood.

Soon, Lumian caught sight of Hope Café, its entrance adorned in a
milky-white veneer.

After pushing open the heavy door, he cast his gaze upon the corner
granting anyone a vantage point.

A slender-faced man in his thirties, his ebony hair framing azure eyes,
his beard trimmed meticulously and waxed to precision, met Lumian's
gaze---his attention fixated on the entrance.

Sensing Lumian's scrutiny, the man's visage transformed. He reached for
the soft-covered notebook and crimson fountain pen upon the table, on
the verge of vanishing through the back door.

In response, Lumian drew his revolver and dispatched a shot toward the
café's rear exit.

With a resounding bang, the bullet embedded itself into the wood.

The café's patrons were jolted into alarm, their reactions oscillating
between concealment and inquiry, engendering chaos.

The bearded man stood immobilized, neither sure if he should run or
stay.

Under the collective gaze of bartender, patrons, and staff, Lumian
advanced toward his target, revolver in hand, amusement playing across
his features.

"Are you Monsieur Bühler?"

"Yes, that's me." Bühler forced a smile.

Lumian gestured toward Bühler's original seat and spoke nonchalantly,

"Take a seat. I've come to purchase information."

A sigh of relief escaped Bühler as he hunched, retracing his steps to
settle into the chair.

Lumian occupied the opposite seat, putting down his revolver. With a
trace of playfulness, he queried, "Why the preference for such a dim
corner?"

Bühler sighed and said, "In my line of work, reprisals are a constant
concern. You're well aware that some individuals detest seeing their
names or likenesses entangled in the web of scandals across newspapers
and periodicals.

"This corner grants me an unobstructed view of the entrance, affording
early detection of any potential troublemakers. And, should the need
arise, I can effect a swift escape through the back."
