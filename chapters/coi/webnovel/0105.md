## Chapter 105: That Person

Pons Bénet's grip tightened relentlessly, his eyes bloodshot and
bulging.

If it hadn't been for the fact that Lumian couldn't speak or that his
vision had started to fade to black, he would have thanked him.

Suddenly, a hand appeared from nowhere, grasping Pons Bénet's hair at
the back of his head, trying to forcibly pry him off Lumian.

"What the hell are you doing? Are you trying to kill him? Have you lost
your damn mind?"

Pierre Berry growled in a deep voice as he intervened, stopping Pons
Bénet.

But Pons Bénet wouldn't listen. His crimson eyes locked onto Lumian, his
mind consumed by fury and murderous intent. All he could think of was
killing this bastard.

*Whack!*

Pierre Berry swung his right leg up, striking Pons Bénet's groin with
his brand-new leather shoe.

Pons Bénet reflexively let go, clutching his crotch, squeezing his
thighs together, and collapsing to the ground.

He whimpered involuntarily, his face contorted in agony, like a rooster
being strangled by the neck.

Pierre Berry glanced at him coolly and said, "Once you've recovered,
bring Lumian to the altar. The ritual is about to begin."

He shifted his gaze, bending down to assess Lumian's condition.

As Lumian's senses returned and he slowly opened his eyes, he
straightened up and nodded.

His darkening vision restored to clarity, the pain in his neck became
more apparent. Lumian was disheartened to find that his view was not of
the familiar ceiling of his bedroom but of Pierre Berry's bloodied face.

*Am I still alive?* He wondered subconsciously as he turned his
head and spotted Pons Bénet curled up on the ground.

"Pathetic!" Lumian spat contemptuously. "If you can't satisfy women and
can't even kill a man, what's the point of living?"

Pons Bénet felt a wave of rage surge through his head. If it weren't for
the lingering pain in his groin and Pierre Berry's watchful eye, he
would have snapped once more.

Lumian and Aurore's house lay in ruins, more than half its roof missing.

Ryan, Leah, and Valentine crept back under the moon and starlight.

Once they confirmed the area was clear, Ryan turned to Leah and said,
"Tonight's situation is worse than we thought. Perform divination."

As they traveled from Cordu Village to Lumian's house, they noticed that
every house was empty. They had no idea where everyone had gone.

This was a shocking anomaly!

"Alright." Leah nodded.

Before she could take out a pen and paper to write a divination
statement, Ryan reminded her, "Be cautious. Choose the direction of the
divination carefully. Don't attempt it if it feels too risky."

"Understood." Leah was well-versed in this area. She knew that Cordu was
a place filled with danger and abnormalities. A minor error in the
divination direction could lead to severe injuries or loss of control.

After a few moments of contemplation, she entered Aurore's bedroom,
which now lacked a wall along the corridor, and found a manuscript to
use as a medium.

As Leah wrote the divination statement, Ryan and Valentine entered
Lumian's room where they had been sleeping.

Ryan's brownish-yellow suitcase sat beside the desk near the window,
concealed by the curtain.

Seeing that the item was still there, Ryan breathed a sigh of relief and
said to Valentine, "Make the preparations."

As he spoke, he pulled the suitcase out, placed it on the ground, and
undid the brass-like metal buckle.

Valentine opened his arms slightly, and illusory golden flames emerged
from the void, illuminating the room.

With Sunlight, Ryan finally dared to open his suitcase with a grave
expression.

Inside, there were no clothes, books, or coins---just a strange, folded
scarecrow lying quietly.

The scarecrow's eyes were covered with thick black cloth strips. Its
face, neck, palms, feet, and calves were made of brownish-green straw,
but its arms, chest, and thighs were covered in real, slightly
pale-white skin.

This was a mystical item that the joint investigation team had acquired
from the Eternal Blazing Sun Church's Riston diocese before their
departure.

Teams at their level could request Sealed Artifacts to handle
abnormalities.

Ryan closed his eyes, and information about the mystical item before him
naturally surfaced in his mind.

"Number: 217

"Name: Tanago Scarecrow.

"Danger Grade: 2. Dangerous. Use with care and moderation. It can only
be applied for operations that require three or more people, or by
deacons and diocesan bishops.

"Security classification: Bishop, Team Captain, or above.

"Description: This scarecrow was first discovered in the Tanago region
of Riston Province, near the remnants of a village annihilated by a
cult's worship ritual.

"Two Purifiers, ten police officers, and 76 farmers vanished after
passing by the farm where the scarecrow was placed, never to be seen
again.

"Research suggests that those who enter a 30-meter radius of the
scarecrow and lock eyes with it will lose self-awareness and be drawn
towards it uncontrollably. Within moments, they disappear, leaving
behind only their possessions and garments.

"At the zenith of sunlight, the scarecrow loses its power; touching it
or meeting its gaze has no effect.

"A farmer from a neighboring village claims the scarecrow was once
ordinary, indistinguishable from others until the village farmland it
protected was decimated.

"With each disappearance, flesh and skin appear on a small portion of
the scarecrow.

"Its ultimate transformation remains a mystery, but revival seems a
likely outcome.

"The scarecrow already displays signs of life, moving at night and
attempting to break free from its containment.

"Sealing Method: Blindfold it with a thick, black cloth and enclose it
in a confined, dark space.

"Usage Process: Remove the scarecrow only under sunlight, and unbind the
black cloth from its eyes.

"Appendix: 1. Avoid its gaze at all costs. Even under the protection of
sunlight, you risk enduring lasting nightmares and mental debilitation.

"2. Limit interaction with the scarecrow to no more than two minutes per
session. Excessive use intensifies its determination to escape and
resist.

"3. Warning: Permanently seal the scarecrow before it acquires enough
flesh."

As Ryan and Valentine investigated the Sealed Artifact's possible loss
or escape, Leah entered a dream divination state.

Whispering the divination incantation to locate Aurore, she sat at her
desk, reclined in her chair, closed her eyes, and quickly drifted into
slumber.

Guided by her four silver bells, Leah glimpsed Aurore, clad in a simple
white robe, in a surreal, distorted world. She recognized an altar,
nearby villagers, and the distant stained glass and golden walls of a
cathedral...

Leah's eyes flew open, and she bolted from the room. Breathlessly, she
informed Ryan and Valentine, "They're all at the cathedral! Performing a
ritual!"

†

Inside the cathedral of the Eternal Blazing Sun.

Pons Bénet carried the disappointed Lumian toward the altar adorned with
lilacs and tulips. Pierre Berry, keeping a watchful eye, accompanied
them.

Glancing at his sister Aurore, her eyes vacant, Lumian turned to Pierre
Berry and sneered.

"You're nothing but a coward and a piece of trash!"

The shepherd shot him a glance but remained silent, his expression
unchanging.

Undeterred, Lumian continued, grinning, "Your woman died of illness, yet
you did nothing. You just put your faith in a malevolent god. Didn't she
die because the factory owner overworked her and paid her next to
nothing? If I were you, I'd have hunted down that boss and hung his
whole family from the factory chimney! But you didn't! You were too
scared. Scared you'd die too. Trash, coward!"

As Lumian studied Pierre Berry's subtle reactions, he slyly added
Provocation to his final words.

Pierre Berry's expression contorted; his gentle gaze slowly morphed into
a menacing glare, as if a hidden seal had been broken, unleashing the
demon within.

Padre Guillaume Bénet, at the altar, barked sternly, "Control yourself!"

Pierre Berry shuddered and came to his senses.

In retaliation, he ripped a piece of cloth from his ragged attire,
crumpled it into a ball, and shoved it into Lumian's mouth.

*Fuck!* Lumian struggled fiercely, but to no avail.

He kept cursing and adding Provocation, but time was against him. His
mouth was fully gagged by the cloth, and he could no longer speak.

Panic and despair welled up in Lumian's heart, threatening to overwhelm
him.

He desperately reined in his emotions, warding off any thoughts of
surrender.

Carried to the altar, Lumian's mind raced, searching for alternative
ways to end his life.

Soon, he was presented before the padre, the massive black thorn symbol
separating him from Aurore.

Guillaume Bénet motioned for Pierre Berry to help Lumian to his feet,
then scrutinized the young man's face and smiled.

"You're tougher than I thought, but you're still lacking. The world is
so hard a man must have two fathers to look after him, yet you have
none. No one to teach you the ways of life."

"The world is so hard a man must have two fathers to look after him" was
a popular saying in Intis. It referred to both a biological father and a
societal father---often known as a godfather.

This was why the people of Intis often acknowledged godfathers and
godmothers.

The padre taunted Lumian for being an orphan, with neither a godfather
nor a father.

In response, Lumian wished he could retort, mocking the padre about his
own child having three, no, four fathers---the padre himself, his
godfather, his mother's lover... If the gag hadn't held tight, Lumian
would definitely have taunted the padre enough to make him lose his
mind, killing him on the spot.

Unfortunately, he couldn't say anything.

"Should we begin the ritual now?" Pierre Berry inquired of Guillaume
Bénet.

The padre shook his head.

"Let's wait a bit longer."

"What for?" Pierre Berry asked, puzzled.

The padre offered no answer, but Lumian was already devising a new
suicide plan.

Suddenly, inspiration struck.

Enter a deep Cogitation state and submit to the scrutiny of the two
entities. Eagerly, he sought the enigmatic and horrifying voice, hoping
to provoke his own breakdown and loss of control.

Lumian glanced at Aurore, her face blank and her eyes empty, but
otherwise unchanged. He closed his eyes.

First, he envisioned the crimson sun. Once calm, he transformed it into
the orb adorned with eyes and a cross.

Silently, Lumian "saw" the faint gray fog once more. He "saw" the chaos
of overlapping colors and indescribable, non-existent things.

Yet this time, he didn't sense the gaze of an entity lurking within the
fog or looming high above.

*Why is it different? *Lumian's eyes snapped open in surprise.

Just then, a figure entered through the cathedral doors.

Clad in a black robe and a wide hood, the man's face was obscured by
shadows. He stood tall, around 1.8 meters in height.

As the mysterious figure approached the altar, the padre stepped aside
deferentially, his demeanor humble and reverent.

*Who is that? The one behind the padre?* Lumian puzzled, peering
closer.

The more he studied the man, the more familiar he seemed, as though
Lumian had encountered him before.

Suddenly, it clicked.

This was the figure lurking in the corner of the Warlock's tomb!

The black-robed man ascended the altar and stood before Lumian. Leaning
forward slightly, he stifled a chuckle.

"Did you realize that Cogitation is useless?"

*What? How does he know? *Lumian stared at him, shocked and
bewildered.

At this proximity, even with the hood concealing his features, Lumian
could discern the black-robed man's face.

He was a young man in his late teens, his limbs long and lean, his hair
short and jet-black, his eyes a light blue, and his features sharply
chiseled. He was strikingly handsome.

*What...* Lumian's gaze locked onto the man.

He knew this face all too well. He saw it every day when he looked in
the mirror.

It was himself!
