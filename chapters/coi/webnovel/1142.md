## Chapter 1142: Rewards

As rays of light rose and solidified into various figures, each
completing their greeting to Mr. Fool, the central head of Lumian
scanned the room and said, "Thank you all for your help. At the moment,
I only possess the Post-Apocalyptic Scripture as an Angel-level item, so
I can't provide equivalent compensation for everyone. However, if
there's anything you need from me in the future, just let me know."

Hearing the second half of this statement, The Hanged Man Alger was
momentarily stunned before realizing something critical: This was a
promise.

And this promise was worth more than any Grade 0 Sealed Artifact!

After all, Lumian was now a dual Sequence 0 true god. The help promised
by a true god surpassed the value of any Grade 0 Sealed Artifact!

Little do I know, a Tarot Club member has already turned into a true
god... The Hanged Man Alger found his thoughts adrift.

When the Tarot Club was first established, he had harbored doubts,
excitement, and fantasies but had never imagined witnessing a scene like
this.

In the brief silence that followed, Madam Justice, Mr. Star, and the
others similarly came to grips with the fact that Mr. Chariot was now
both the Red Priest and the Chaos Demoness---a dual-pathway true god
poised to become a great existence!

*Not even the Rose Redemption of the past had members of such
caliber...* This sentiment emerged simultaneously in the hearts
of Madam Magician and Ma'am Hermit, both well-versed in ancient history.

The Rose Redemption had been a secret organization of the Third Epoch,
with members ranging from a true god to Kings of Angels.

Mr. Hanged Man glanced at Mr. Sun and Madam Judgment, then smiled at
Lumian. "My spoils of war are my compensation. Besides, it was my duty.
The help I provided was actually quite limited."

This was true. Most of what they had done was of little significance in
Lumian's battle against the Primordial Demoness. For Sequence 3 Saints
wielding Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts, directly intervening in such a
contest would have been suicidal. Even true Angels could only contribute
meaningfully when the Primordial Demoness briefly descended to the level
of a King of Angels.

In other words, those who truly aided Lumian were Madam Magician and
Madam Justice, who intercepted the Demonesses of Gray and Yellow; the
Angel of Time, the Angel of the Holy Spirit, and Ma'am Hermit, who held
off the Abomination siblings; the Evernight Goddess's divine descent,
which delayed the Primordial Demoness long enough for Amon to finish
stealing a wish; and Amon Himself, who transported miracles and enacted
direct salvation.

The other Major Arcana card holders had three primary objectives for
participating in this operation:

To eliminate as many high-ranking Demonesses as possible and seize their
potent Sealed Artifacts to prevent them, unprotected after the
Primordial Demoness's fall, from defecting to the Mother Goddess of
Depravity or succumbing to the crimson moonlight, gradually losing
control and become a latent problem.

To claim spoils of war and grow stronger. Although cruel, the reality
was that the more Angels and Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts in the protected
zones, the more prepared they would be to confront anomalies---and
perhaps even safeguard more of humanity when the apocalypse truly
arrived.

To assist Franca in bringing a catastrophe upon the Demoness Sect.
Without such help, surviving alone would have been a miracle for her.

The Hanged Man Alger believed Lumian's gratitude was primarily directed
at the third point. Hence, he did not downplay his contributions but
merely clarified their limited scope---especially since The Sun Derrick,
Judgment Xio, and even the more significant contributors like Justice,
The Magician, and The Hermit had not yet received spoils of war. He
could not speak for them.

The Sun Derrick nodded and said, "Finding and adhering to my core
justice is compensation enough for me."

The Chariot Lumian did not argue, only smiling in return. "Perhaps I can
assist with your advancement ritual."

Though Lumian had never personally seen any Blasphemy Slate or held the
Cards of Blasphemy's Sun card, as a true god of the Demoness pathway
with the unique chaos vortex face, he could intuitively sense that the
Sun pathway's Sequence 2 Sun Chaser (or Lightseeker) advancement ritual
involved the sun in either a mystical or real-world sense.

The Sun Derrick was silent for two seconds before choosing not to
modestly decline.

In the current situation, this was the justice he needed to uphold.

Lumian then turned to Madam Temperance Sharron.

"I made a promise to Naboredisley---the former Devil Monarch Farbauti.
Once I fulfill it, He will ensure His Abomination avatar perishes and
transfer the Beyonder characteristic to me.

"When the time comes, I would like to exchange that characteristic for
the Calamity of Crimson in your possession."

The name "Calamity of Crimson" came from the consciousness of Cheek's
face.

Trading a Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristic for a Grade 0 Sealed
Artifact corresponding to a Sequence 2 Demoness of Catastrophe was
obviously unequal. However, Sharron knew that the Abomination Beyonder
characteristic was a reward for her teacher, the Angel of the Holy
Spirit, Reinette Tinekerr. The Sequence 2 Ancient Bane extracted from it
would ultimately belong to her. The exchange for the Calamity of Crimson
was effectively an intermediary step.

Sharon picked up a manifested pen, quickly wrote her answer on paper,
and raised it: "No problem."

Lumian nodded before addressing Mr. Sun again, "Once I obtain the
Calamity of Crimson, I'd like to exchange it with the New City of Silver
for the Sealed Artifact, Gift of the Land. I may need it in the future."

The Sealed Artifact---Gift of the Land---originated from Omebella's
remains and was considered a high-risk item. If not for the Church of
The Fool's headquarters being located in the New City of Silver and Mr.
Fool's constant attention, the six-member council would have long
struggled with how to handle it. Now, Lumian had provided them with an
opportunity.

The Sun Derrick was initially tempted but soon felt reluctant.

Though the Gift of the Land had brought great suffering to the City of
Silver, it was also what allowed them to endure over two thousand years
of darkness and despair, finally awaiting Mr. Fool's salvation.

Pain had long been intertwined with the continuation of their bloodline,
making it difficult to separate the two.

Lumian did not rush him, quietly waiting for Mr. Sun to make his
decision.

After some time, The Sun Derrick instinctively looked toward the head of
the bronze table.

When in doubt or difficulty, he always hoped for Mr. Fool's
guidance---and Mr. Hanged Man's advice.

Mr. Fool gently nodded.

The Sun Derrick took a deep breath, suppressing his reluctance, and said
to The Chariot Lumian, "Alright."

The Chariot Lumian shifted his gaze to Madam Justice.

"Once I've used the Gift of the Land, its issues may be resolved. At
that point, I'll give it to you."

The perceptive Justice Audrey did not refuse, nodding before tilting her
head toward Madam Magician with a smile. "If you need it, I can lend it
to you."

This referred to Madam Magician's plan to relocate the entire Abraham
family and as many humans as possible to a more habitable planet at the
edge of the universe when the apocalypse arrived. The Gift of the Land
could effectively terraform the environment and provide sustenance.

Of course, if Omebella's remains retained their unique dangers, carrying
it would be out of the question. It would be better to acquire another
Grade 0 Sealed Artifact corresponding to the Desolate Matriarch.

"Alright," Madam Magician replied without hesitation.

Lumian then addressed her directly, "I will open all special mirror
worlds inhabited by sentient beings. You can travel there and help
spread my teachings. The more anchors I have for my upcoming endeavors,
the better."

Madam Magician immediately understood. This was an opportunity for her
to Travel and counted as a form of compensation.

She had never considered visiting the special mirror worlds or the
extradimensional spaces attached to them for potion digestion because
these belonged to the Primordial Demoness, making them even more
dangerous than traversing the cosmos. After all, roaming the cosmos had
a higher chance of evading the attention of the Great Old Dominators,
whereas entering the Primordial Demoness's domain guaranteed discovery.

*Never thought I'd rely on his help for potion digestion one
day...* The Magician Fors chuckled and asked, "Okay. What is
your current honorific name?"

Lumian deliberated for a few seconds before answering, "The Symbol of
War and Apocalypse, the Demoness wielding Chaos, the Many-Faced One who
offers sacrifices to Calamity, and the Ruler of the Mirror World."

*A true dual-pathway true god...* Madam Magician silently
marveled.

Lumian then turned to Ma'am Hermit. "I will assist Queen Mystic in
completing her digestion of the Sage potion and help you digest as much
as possible."

Ma'am Hermit made an "mm" sound and thanked him.

A Sage always opposed disaster and calamity, and the individual sitting
diagonally opposite her represented these concepts. There was no one
better suited than Lumian to aid in the Sage potion digestion.

Then, Lumian addressed Mr. Star, "Tell Mr. Pallez that I owe him one."

He turned to Madam Judgment next. "I owe you one as well---or the
Post-Apocalyptic Scripture?"

"Alright," said Mr. Star without declining on behalf of the old man.

Under the circumstances, Judgment Xio, known for her group-mindedness
and adherence to order, found it hard to refuse. She chose the favor as
compensation.

Having distributed the rewards, Lumian thought for a moment before
looking at Madam Magician again.

"I'd like to borrow the Box of the Great Old Ones for a while. Perhaps I
can resolve the third level's hidden danger for the Abraham family and
replace it with an equivalent but more manageable anomaly.

"If I don't succeed, I'll return it as is."

Madam Magician's expression became thoughtful before she nodded. "No
problem."

The Chariot Lumian leaned back in his chair, saying no more.

Judgment Xio immediately looked at Mr. Star Leonard. "Can I trade
Solomon's Mask with you for the Justiciar-pathway Grade 0 Sealed
Artifact?"
