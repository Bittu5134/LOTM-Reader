## Chapter 919: Certain Death

The dark yellow bullet flew instantly, striking the reanimated female
corpse.

However, it passed right through, merely causing the silhouette to
waver, become illusory, and disappear.

After being deprived of her Mirror Substitution, the reanimated female
corpse's first reaction was to use the mirrored objects in the
surveillance room to create a mirror projection, supplemented by mirror
illusions, while she quietly changed her position.

So, what Franca had locked onto was just the mirror projection, and what
Sure Hit would hit was also just the mirror projection, not the real
reanimated female corpse.

Having evaded the fatal strike, the silhouette of the reanimated female
corpse immediately became ethereal, projecting onto the nearest mirrored
object.

She intended to use the mirror world to temporarily leave the
battlefield, wait for her Mirror Substitution ability to recover, and
then decide based on the situation whether to wait for the next
opportunity, attack Franca and the others again immediately, or quietly
follow them to determine their identities and whereabouts, so they could
be directly locked onto and kicked out of the dream.

Just as the reanimated female corpse's silhouette became prominent on
the surface of that mirrored object, a person suddenly appeared in the
void dark area behind the mirror.

It was Anthony, wearing a black T-shirt.

Anthony held a charm similar to the Ice Amulet in one hand and the
Winter is Coming revolver in the other, aiming at the reanimated female
corpse who was about to enter the mirror surface.

He had used the Mirror Traversal ability in time to intercept the
reanimated female corpse!

Since Lumian could make his own charms to help Beyonders traverse the
mirror world, he certainly wouldn't make just one, only for Franca.

Besides himself, everyone in the team had one, and each could be used
four times!

They had relied on Franca's Ice Amulet to transfer positions earlier,
partly because since everyone was close together, there was no need to
waste the uses of the other charms. After all, in the dream, Lumian was
restricted to the Sequence 7 level, and making similar charms again had
a high probability of failure. On the other hand, it was also following
Lumian's Conspirer approach and Franca's occasional mutterings after
entering the dream about "appearing weak when you are strong",
deliberately setting a trap for the enemy.

By demonstrating that they could only hide in the mirror world and
transfer positions by holding onto Lumian and Franca's clothes, they led
the reanimated female corpse to believe that the others couldn't perform
Mirror Traversal. So, after evading Franca's attack, the reanimated
female corpse confidently used the mirror world to escape.

This led her right into the gun barrel of Anthony, who had forcibly
concealed his presence earlier.

Anthony pulled the trigger with a calm expression.

Another bullet tinged with a dark yellow glow flew out, heading towards
the reanimated female corpse who was about to enter this area behind the
mirror.

Sure Hit!

*Bang!*

As the gunshot rang out, the reanimated female corpse, who hadn't had
time to retract her black flames, frost, and spider silk to protect
herself, had blood blossoming on her chest, her flesh and bones
splitting.

She was truly hit by the bullet, shot out of the mirror surface, and
fell back into the surveillance room.

Seeing this, Franca aimed at the target once again.

Now, she was going to use the Certain Death bullet.

Meanwhile, Jenna still guarded the surveillance screen, having intention
to steal credit, to prevent stray bullets from destroying the object
that needed protection.

She only quietly extended invisible spider silk, intending to touch the
blood splattered by the reanimated female corpse, to use it as a medium
for curses.

At this moment, the reanimated female corpse suddenly raised her head
and let out a painful scream.

Her hair rose strand by strand, instantly becoming long and thick, like
venomous snakes.

The tips of this slimy, bizarre black hair were each inlaid with black
and white eyeballs and heads that stuck out forked tongues like snakes.

Jenna instinctively closed her eyes, but still felt her thoughts
becoming chaotic, pain and pleasure arising simultaneously, her body
inexplicably stiffening as if turning to stone.

In this instant, she suddenly understood what the enemy was doing.

The reanimated female corpse seemed to have sensed that she was about to
suffer a fatal blow, and with no way to avoid it or protect herself by
forming a huge cocoon, she actively indulged in her own madness,
displaying an incomplete Mythical Creature form that only Saints should
possess.

For most Saints, displaying an incomplete Mythical Creature form was
extremely dangerous, leading to a loss of control. Unless there were no
other options or they intended to drag the enemy down with them, no one
would use it.

For Beyonders without godhood, directly viewing an incomplete Mythical
Creature form would result in intense corruption and terrible mental
shock, likely leading to madness and loss of control. Even if they
didn't look directly and closed their eyes, being within range would
still cause some corruption.

Saints with godhood would still be affected to some degree by the
incomplete Mythical Creature form, and would continue to be affected
afterwards while facing the frenzied attacks of the incomplete Mythical
Creature---the incomplete Mythical Creature form was a Saint's most
powerful and dangerous state.

As the horrifying transformation of the reanimated female corpse
reflected in Franca's eyes, she gritted her teeth and resolutely pulled
the trigger of the Inevitable Gun.

*Bang!*

A dull green bullet flew from the muzzle, heading straight for the
reanimated female corpse's body hidden by the slimy, thick hair.

Franca then let out a painful cry.

She instinctively tilted her head back, her black hair tied in a
ponytail and modified by Lie broke free from its restraints, becoming
wild and distinct, seemingly growing thicker.

Her face took on a grayish-white tinge, her chest felt somewhat swollen,
and her mind felt as if it had been hit by a storm, all thoughts blown
about, becoming mad, twisted, and dark.

She felt intense pleasure and also extreme pain. This, combined with her
body's state already infected by disease and decay forces, caused her to
passively trigger a Mirror Substitution.

With a cracking sound, Franca regressed into a mirror and shattered into
pieces.

But when her silhouette was outlined in the corner, while she no longer
felt the effects of disease and decay, her hair still floated in
mid-air, still growing thicker. Her face was extremely pale and twisted
to the extreme, yet presenting a strange beauty, her eyes full of
madness and malice.

Corruption couldn't be transferred by Mirror Substitution, nor could the
tendency towards losing control.

At the same time, the Certain Death bullet fired by Franca hit the mass
of slimy, bizarre black hair of the "reanimated female corpse".

Although the effect of Certain Death was suppressed to Sequence 7 level,
only certainly fatal to ordinary people, it was still deadly to the
already severely injured reanimated female corpse. Moreover, the
reanimated female corpse's incomplete Mythical Creature form was also
limited to Sequence 7, only possessing defensive capabilities at this
level!

The bullet glowing with a dull green light penetrated through layers of
thick hair, entering the brain of the reanimated female corpse in her
incomplete Mythical Creature form.

*Smack!*

The reanimated female corpse's head split open, blood and white matter
splattering outwards.

The slimy, bizarre thick hair with black and white eyeballs fell in
succession, returning to their original state to varying degrees.

Only then did Anthony dare to jump out from the mirror-like object,
turning his back to the corpse with its strange charm and mental
corruption. From a not-too-distant position, he began to perform
Psychoanalysis on Franca, which was essentially throwing a Placate her
way.

Franca's painful and mad chaotic thoughts calmed, and the symptoms of
losing control in her body began to subside.

Seeing this, Anthony quietly let out a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, the reanimated female corpse's incomplete Mythical Creature
form was also only at the Sequence 7 level, so the corruption and impact
on Franca were at this level. Otherwise, he really wouldn't have known
if she could be saved; that might have depended on Franca's own
willpower.

As Anthony began the second Placate, Lumian jumped out of the
surveillance screen.

He instinctively looked towards Franca and Jenna, checking their
conditions.

Seeing that the problems were all within an acceptable range, Lumian
then turned his gaze to the reanimated female corpse on the ground with
its split head and bizarre hair.

As a fellow Saint, he only experienced a slight emotional fluctuation,
without any other reaction.

*Their joint efforts had actually taken down a Demoness of Despair with
Mirror Substitution...* Lumian was surprised and quite
gratified.

He unconsciously looked towards Ludwig, finding that the little boy was
staring at the Demoness's corpse with blazing eyes, completely
unconcerned about possibly being corrupted.

Indeed, Ludwig wouldn't be affected by the incomplete Mythical Creature
form. Moreover, the corpse had already left the incomplete Mythical
Creature form, with only some characteristics remaining.

While repeatedly creating seven clusters at a time of deep black Flames
of Destruction to burn the patches of viscous flesh and yellow-green pus
in the surveillance room, Lumian took out a mirror, bent down, and put
the reanimated female corpse with its burst head inside.

They couldn't let this corpse continue to corrupt the surveillance room,
affecting Jenna and Franca who were recovering!

During this process, a black, irregularly shaped mirror fragment fell
from the corpse.

*As expected, she has a fragment of a special mirror world...*
Lumian stuffed the black fragment into the Traveler's Bag, planning to
compare it with Franca's and the others' later.

By this time, about a third of the viscous flesh and yellow-green pus in
the surveillance room had caught fire, and the black flames began to
spread to the surroundings, seeking other combustible materials.

"Phew..." Franca let out a long breath, her mental state finally
stabilizing, the abnormalities on her body having subsided.

Anthony moved to Jenna's side, performing Psychoanalysis on her, who had
not been much corrupted.

After putting the Inevitable Gun back into the Traveler's Bag, Franca
was about to proudly tell Lumian "We took down a Demoness of Despair"
when her eyes suddenly caught sight of the several cameras in the
surveillance room.

She immediately changed her words. "I'll check if our fight just now was
caught on the cameras."

"Couldn't we just completely destroy the surveillance equipment with the
Flames of Destruction?" Lumian thought it wasn't necessary to be so
troublesome.

"What if this mall's surveillance footage is stored on a cloud server?"
Franca wasn't too sure, but felt it necessary to guard against this
possibility.

Lumian didn't stop Franca further, because he didn't understand what a
cloud server was.

Franca quickly manipulated the surveillance system, and after a while
said, "It's fine, the reanimated female corpse probably destroyed the
cameras in this room when she came to check the surveillance."

As she spoke, she used another Mirror Substitution, because Lumian
couldn't make the entire room be engulfed by the Flames of Destruction.
He could only create clusters of flames and burn areas bit by bit, with
mystical pathogens and decay forces still lingering in the air.

Lumian nodded and continued, "Check if my battle in the surveillance
world has become part of the surveillance footage. If there's no
problem, let's hurry back for the spirit channeling."

"Can it work like that?" Franca said in surprise.

This was equivalent to the actions of a dummy in a painted world
changing the painting itself.
