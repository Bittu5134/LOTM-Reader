## Chapter 2: "Prank"

Ryan apologized politely to Lumian. "Forgive me, I did not expect such a
situation," he said.

Lumian chuckled.

"Are you suggesting we need another glass of *La Fée Verte*?"

Without waiting for Ryan's response, he changed the subject.

"What brings foreigners like you to Cordu? Are you here to buy wool or
leather?"

Many of Cordu's residents made their living as shepherds.

Ryan breathed a silent sigh of relief and seized the opportunity to
explain their true purpose.

"We came to visit the Eternal Blazing Sun Church's padre, Guillaume
Bénet, but he seems to be absent from both his home and the cathedral."

Pierre, who had enjoyed Ryan's free absinthe, kindly reminded him that
there was only one church in Cordu.

The other locals around the bar counter were all drinking, but no one
answered Ryan's question. The name seemed to represent some kind of
taboo or authority that couldn't be openly discussed.

Lumian took a sip of drink and thought for a few seconds before offering
his assistance.

"I can roughly guess where the padre is. Do you need me to take you
there?"

Leah didn't stand on ceremony. "If it's not too much trouble," she said.

Ryan nodded in agreement.

"Once you've finished your drink."

"Alright." Lumian raised his glass and finished the light-green alcohol.

He put down his glass and got to his feet.

"Let's go."

"*Merci beaucoup*," Ryan expressed his gratitude and gestured
for Valentine and Leah to stand up.

Lumian's face lit up with a smile. "It's no problem at all. You heard my
story and I enjoyed a complimentary drink. That makes us friends,
n'est-ce pas?"

"*Oui*." Ryan nodded.

Lumian's grin widened, stretching from ear to ear. He opened his arms
wide, beckoning the other party in for a hug.

"Ah, it is good to meet you, my cabbages," he exclaimed with fervor.

Ryan, who was about to be enveloped in a bear hug, froze.

"Cabbages?"

His expression was a mixture of perplexity and embarrassment.

Valentine and Leah mirrored his expression.

"It is a term of endearment we use for our friends," Lumian explained
with innocent sincerity. "Everyone in the Dariège region is aware of it.
It has been a tradition for centuries, believe me, my cabbages."

Leah couldn't help but glance around, producing the tinkling sounds.

Pierre and the others nodded in agreement, assuring the newcomers that
Lumian's words were true. However, the grins on their faces hinted that
they were pleased to see foreigners struggling to comprehend their
affectionate greetings.

Lumian stroked his chin thoughtfully.

"Don't you fancy it?"

"Then I shall opt for a different option. It can also be used for
friends.

"My dear bunnies, my darling chicks, my lovely ducks, or perhaps my
adorable lambs? Which one tickles your fancy?"

But Ryan's expression was as stiff as a board, and Valentine's brow
furrowed in confusion.

Leah let out a sigh, a mix of exasperation and amusement.

"Let's just stick with cabbage, shall we? At least it sounds normal."

*Phew.* Ryan let out a quiet sigh and gently grasped Valentine's
elbow. He gave a slight nod and remarked, "They all seem like precious
treasures in the family."

Without awaiting Lumian's response, he swiveled his body and addressed
the bartender, "How much will it be?"

"Two verl d'or," replied the bartender, eyeing the glasses lined up on
the counter.

Ryan settled the bill, and Leah shifted the conversation to a different
subject.

"Lumian is an uncommon name."

"At least better than names like Pierre and Guillaume," Lumian countered
with a grin. "If you were to call out Pierre in this place, a third of
the people would turn their heads. Call out Guillaume, and another third
will respond. As for this gentleman..."

He gestured to the skinny middle-aged man sipping his free drink.

"His full name is Pierre Guillaume."

Leah flashed a smile, skirting the topic of cabbage.

As they departed from the tavern, Lumian turned around and surveyed the
surroundings.

"What's the matter?" Leah inquired with curiosity.

Lumian pondered for a moment and replied thoughtfully, "It's not just
the three of you foreigners who came to the tavern today. Another person
arrived earlier, but I don't know when they left."

"What did they look like?" Ryan asked with a serious expression.

Lumian took a moment to reflect.

"A lady. Very sophisticated. You can tell she's from the city with just
one glance. I can't describe her appearance. Why don't I sketch her for
you?"

"Do you know how to draw?" Leah queried, aware of Lumian's
idiosyncrasies.

Lumian chortled.

"I don't."

"In that case, let's locate the padre first," Ryan decided, drawing the
conversation to a close.

Cordu was a place devoid of street lamps at night, yet the twinkling
stars above provided a faint glimmer that allowed the four of them to
navigate the road. The yellowish light emanating from the windows on
either side only added to the ethereal ambiance.

As they approached the Eternal Blazing Sun cathedral situated in the
village square, the grandiose structure appeared somewhat blurry in the
darkness, as if it was merging with the night.

"We've been here before. There's no one here," Valentine grumbled with a
frown.

Lumian smiled and said, "No one at the front door doesn't mean there's
no one elsewhere."

He then proceeded to lead Ryan and the others around the front of the
cathedral towards the cemetery, where they found a dark brown wooden
door.

Lumian didn't wait for Ryan to knock. Instead, he reached over and
fiddled with the keyhole before opening the side door with a creak.

"That's not very nice, is it?" Ryan frowned.

Leah nodded in agreement, her bells tinkling.

"We're here to visit the padre, not to fight him."

"Alright," Lumian acquiesced.

He closed the wooden door and knocked lightly.

"Hey, is anyone there? I'll come in if you don't answer," he muttered in
a low voice that was barely audible in the night.

There was no response from inside the cathedral.

Without hesitation, Lumian pushed open the door and gestured inside.

"Go on in."

Ryan hesitated. He looked at the darkness behind the door and glanced at
his companions.

"Okay." He took a step forward, slow but firm.

Leah and Valentine followed closely behind.

The four silvery bells adorning Leah's boots and veil were eerily
silent.

The environment was dim and eerie as the four of them made their way
forward.

Out of nowhere, Ryan came to a halt and muttered in a low voice, "What's
that noise?"

"Yes, I heard it too," Lumian agreed.

Without wasting any time, he forcefully pushed the door aside, and it
opened with a loud clang, revealing what lay beyond.

The dimly lit space resembled a confessional. A beam of starlight shone
through, revealing a naked man in his prime, lying atop a fair-skinned
woman.

The scene stunned everyone, including the man and the woman.

Suddenly, the man sat up and bellowed at Ryan and his team,
"*Sacrebleu*! You've ruined the holy church's plans!"

Amidst the reverberating roar, Lumian, who had quietly approached behind
the group, waved his hand and spoke quickly, "Ah, it seems we have
discovered our padre. *Au revoir*, my cabbages!"

Before anyone could react, Lumian dashed towards the side door, leaving
his words to drift away in the wind.

As the team stood in shock, Leah, Ryan, and Valentine couldn't shake the
words of the middle-aged man, Pierre Guillaume, from their minds:
*"...you should steer clear of this one. He's the most mischievous bloke
in the whole village."*

___

Lumian sauntered down the country road, hands tucked in his pockets
while whistling a tune under the stars.

"As expected, the padre is having an affair with Madame Pualis."

"*Mon dieu*, these foreigners exude an air of prestige. The
padre would never dream of crossing them. He must pay an exorbitant sum
to keep his sordid dalliances under wraps and preserve his standing
within the cathedral."

"Hmph, he only has himself to blame for lusting after Aurore. I have
been biding my time for this chance..."

As Lumian muttered to himself, he returned to his abode on the outskirts
of the hamlet.

The structure he called home was a peculiar semi-subterranean two-story
affair. The ground floor doubled as both a kitchen and a lounge. A hefty
oven and a grandiose stove dominated the room.

"Aurore! Aurore!" Lumian hollered as he trudged up the stairs.

No reply.

The upper storey was divided into three chambers and a lavatory, all the
doors stood open.

Lumian peeped into each room but couldn't find his sister.

He mulled it over for a moment, then marched to the end of the corridor
and clambered up the ladder that led to the roof.

The roof was a fiery orange, painted by the twilight sky. In the center
sat a figure, holding their knees and staring contemplatively at the
sparkling stars.

This was an exquisite woman, exceptionally so. Her long and thick locks
were a shade of gold, her eyes a pale blue, and her facial features were
intricate and refined.

Her gaze was fixated on the cosmos, her countenance serene, akin to that
of a statue.

Lumian remained silent. He shifted to her side and sat next to her.

He lifted his head, gazing at the dense forest in the distance,
absorbing the susurrus of the wind blowing through the trees.

After a while, the woman raised her arms and stretched, paying no heed
to her appearance.

"Aurore, I don't understand why you come up here so often. What's so
interesting about this view?" Lumian commented.

"Call me *Grande Soeur*!" Aurore scolded playfully, tapping
Lumian's head with her finger.

Aurore sighed and thought to herself, "A philosopher once said that
there are only two things worth revering in this world. One is the
morality in one's heart, and the other is the cosmos above one's head."

Lumian noticed his sister's slightly melancholic expression and flashed
a grin.

"I know the answer to this question. Emperor Roselle said so!"

"Pfft..." Aurore laughed.

She took a sniff and raised her beautiful golden eyebrows.

"You've been drinking again!"

"This is called socializing." Lumian took the opportunity to recount
what had just happened. "I met three foreigners..."

Aurore could not help but laugh.

"I'm really afraid that the padre will have a heart attack."

Her expression then turned serious. "Lumian, don't provoke the padre
anymore. It'll be troublesome if we get a new one."

"But I can't stand his face..." Lumian complained before Aurore stood
up.

She looked down at her brother and smiled.

"Alright, it's bedtime, my inebriated brother," Aurore said with a smile
as she threw out some silver dust.

Aurore flew down from the roof like a bird and entered the window on the
second floor, leaving Lumian behind.

Lumian watched this quietly and shouted anxiously, "What about me?"

"Climb down yourself!" Aurore replied mercilessly.

Lumian pursed his lips, his smile fading bit by bit.

He watched the silver specks of light disappear in the night sky, sighed
softly, and muttered to himself, "I wonder when I'll be able to possess
such extraordinary powers..."
