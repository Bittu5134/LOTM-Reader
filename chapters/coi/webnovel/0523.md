## Chapter 523: Eye of Illusory

A lanky shadow emerged from the shadows in translucent form. Swiftly, it
lunged at Lumian, as if eager to claim a new host.

Resembling the possession of Wraiths and evil spirits, this entity
sought control but lacked the speed to complete the process in a mere
blink.

In an instant, Lumian, previously dormant, transformed into a shadowy
figure, melding seamlessly with the darkness, leaving the bed bereft of
his presence.

This marked the manifestation of his newly contracted skill---Shadow
Transformation!

An eerie hush enveloped the room, dominated by the tall, translucent
shadow, erasing any trace of Lumian or his unseen assailant.

Suddenly, the darkness rifted, revealing a decaying, skeletal python
oozing yellowish-green pus.

Empty-eyed, its fangless mouth resembled a vortex, emitting a hurried,
piercing sound. A suction force tugged at the surrounding shadows,
drawing them in.

It seemed like an undead creature, a specialist in consuming shadows and
shadowy creatures.

Room 5 of the Flying Bird's first-class cabin's master bedroom assumed
an otherworldly tableau. Despite the lingering dim light, shadows
dissipated, leaving everything cloaked in pure darkness.

In due time, Lumian emerged from the shadows, resuming his human form
against the backdrop of a lush carpet and an exquisite wardrobe.

Simultaneously, a towering figure materialized---a knight adorned in
tattered black armor. Pale flames flickered in its eye sockets, putrid
liquid seeping from the armor's crevices, with only sticky flesh
clinging to its exposed skin.

With a broadsword raised, the dead knight advanced, slashing at Lumian,
as if poised to shatter both bed and wardrobe.

Lumian's agile form shifted, maneuvering from facing the Death Knight,
the Shadow-Swallowing Python, and the looming tall, thin shadow to flank
them all.

*Crash!*

The broadsword of the Death Knight cleaved through the wardrobe, sending
fragments flying. Lumian, reacting swiftly, crouched down, clenched his
fists, and struck the heavy brownish-yellow carpet.

From the center, a multitude of crimson, nearly white flames burst
forth, consuming every inch of the room. The inferno devoured the three
undead entities suspected to be from the spirit world.

*Rumble!*

Within the roaring flames, fireballs materialized and shot out from
Lumian's form.

They homed in on the Death Knight, the Shadow-Swallowing Python, and the
lanky black shadow, or recklessly engulfed the sizable bedroom.

*Rumble!*

The crimson, nearly white fireballs detonated consecutively, tearing
apart the three undead beings, pulverizing the bed, desk, and other
furnishings. Pungent smoke billowed from the scorched carpet.

In this explosive turmoil, any entity lacking pure ethereality or
possessing partial corporeality faced inevitable destruction in the
confined space. The once steel-clad armor of the Death Knight crumbled
instantly, and the Shadow-Swallowing Python fractured into a multitude
of burning remains.

Though the lanky shadow fared relatively better, it too succumbed to the
engulfing flames, dwindling in substance.

*Rumble!*

Although the Flying Bird boasted a steel structure, the impact of such
force---reminiscent of multiple cannons targeting a confined
space---inevitably took its toll on Room 5 of the first-class cabin.
Strangely, only cracks marred the inner wall, with neither the wall nor
the door fully giving way.

However, the formless barrier enveloping the area shuddered violently,
on the verge of disintegration.

As shockwaves rebounded from the walls, doors, and ceiling, Lumian, the
catalyst of the explosion, suffered as well. It was akin to being struck
repeatedly by a massive hammer, with his vision clouded by golden specks
and a metallic taste of blood in his throat.

The air, instantly devoured by flames, left him with a suffocating
sensation.

Amidst the tumultuous flames, a figure emerged from the darkness,
standing near the window, adorned in a black robe with a loose hood.
Numerous wounds marked his body, testament to the explosive waves and
engulfing flames, leaving charred imprints.

Lumian observed that the man's once fine hairs had transformed into
pale-white, nearly indistinguishable feathers. Some were charred,
emitting a dark dense fog instead of thick smoke.

Rather than the usual red blood, a thick yellowish-green hue oozed from
the wounds.

Under the raised hood, Lumian discerned a pale-white face and a few
ulcers reaching down to the bone. Vague traces of pale-white fur adorned
the wounds.

In the blink of an eye, Lumian locked eyes with his opponent, who
sported cold flaxen-colored irises. Between the brows of the hooded
figure, a crack swiftly widened, revealing an illusory vertical eye with
a deep purple border that almost verged on black. Devoid of eyelashes or
pupils, it seemed to harbor countless pale-white patterns.

This peculiar vertical eye instantly mirrored Lumian's figure.

His initial intention to "teleport" behind the hooded man and employ the
Spell of Harrumph met an abrupt freeze.

The impact resonated at the spiritual level.

It was akin to Lumian's Soul Body losing the protective shield of his
physical form and standing exposed to scorching sunlight. Instinctively,
fear, stiffness, and lethargy gripped him.

Ordinarily, humans explored the spirit world through Astral Projection,
rarely detaching their Soul Body---the core of their soul---from their
physical being, always shrouded in protection.

The Arbiter pathway's Psychic Piercing bypassed the physical body, Ether
Body, Astral Projection, and Body of Heart and Mind, directly
influencing the Soul Body. It carried an almost undefendable reputation,
affecting individuals to varying degrees.

Lumian suspected that the Spell of Harrumph shared these
characteristics.

Within the assailant's dark-purple, nearly black vertical eye,
pale-white patterns silently spun, as if seeking the essence of Lumian's
Spirit Body.

The sensation resembled being scrutinized by penetrating rays of light,
causing Lumian's Spirit Body to quiver slightly, impeding intricate
thoughts.

Just as he was about to take the simplest action of sinking his
consciousness into the Blood Emperor mark on his right hand, the hooded
man emitted a sudden pained groan.

His head snapped back as if struck by a bullet, the once illusory,
dark-purple vertical eye now blurry, oozing dark-red blood mixed with
yellowish-green pus.

With a pained groan, the hooded figure swiftly turned and soared out of
the window, dragged by an unseen force.

Observing this, Lumian didn't hasten to block the escape with Spirit
World Traversal. Instead, he raised his right hand and snapped his
fingers.

*Boom!*

At the window, a crimson, almost blinding light erupted, and a violent
explosion engulfed the hooded man.

Lumian had set this as a trap.

Before entering a state of "sleep," he had concealed the master bedroom
within the Bottle of Fiction. There were two entrances, one by the
window and the other by the door, accessible only to beings with
superpowers. Both exits harbored delayed explosion fireballs.

Any trigger would unleash devastation.

Amidst the fiery explosion, the hooded man was propelled off his feet,
crashing against the window frame. His limbs seemed on the brink of
tearing from his body.

Without a moment's hesitation, Lumian teleported to the severely injured
and unconscious man, harrumphing at his foe.

Two beams of white light shot forth, striking the target and rendering
him completely unconscious.

As Lumian prepared for his next move, pairs of arms suddenly emerged
from the darkness at the shattered exit of the Bottle of Fiction.

Some were covered in warts, some decayed to the point of pus
overflowing, and some only displayed blackened bones...

These arms seized the hooded man's clothes and dragged him into the
shadows, disappearing without a trace.

Observing this, Lumian refrained from an immediate transformation into a
shadow creature to pursue them. Instead, he stood his ground, a slight
frown creasing his brows.

The assailant shared an uncanny resemblance to Demon Warlock Burman as
depicted on the wanted posters, but the non-human feeling was even more
pronounced. The details suggested an undying monster rather than a
human.

Lumian wasn't caught off guard by Demon Warlock Burman's appearance. It
was one of the anticipated outcomes.

He had deliberately voiced suspicions about Fidel's connection with the
Demon Warlock in front of him without providing clarity, fostering the
illusion that Louis Berry, a bold adventurer with a penchant for
conspiracies, was attempting to extort money from the prominent
merchant.

Under normal circumstances, even if Fidel had something to hide, he
wouldn't act so swiftly. He would likely observe closely for a few days
to confirm the situation. Lumian, however, had "offered" him an
opportunity this time.

Louis Berry, the adventurer, had made public the commission he accepted
to lure out Baronet Black!

In such a scenario, it wouldn't raise eyebrows if he were killed by
Class Khizi.

The death of an overconfident individual in Port Farim wouldn't spark
trouble or suspicion.

So, why not nip the danger in the bud?

Even if Louis Berry's suspicions lacked evidence, they would still draw
the attention of official Beyonders.

Lumian's "performance" at the bar the previous night seemed to bait
Black Baronet Class Khizi, but in reality, it was bait for the merchant,
Fidel Guerra!

If Fidel had no ties to the Demon Warlock, it wouldn't trigger an
additional reaction. Lumian merely needed to pursue the superficial
purpose of hunting Black Baronet. If there was a connection, he would
promptly receive a "response."

To Lumian's surprise, the abilities exhibited by Demon Warlock Burman
shared similarities with the few divine pathways he knew, but there were
also notable differences!
