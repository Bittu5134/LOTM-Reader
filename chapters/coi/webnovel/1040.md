## Chapter 1040: Individual Impressions

"Though outwardly quiet and reserved, he actually likes to joke and
tease in his mind, and occasionally even rambles..."

Madam Magician listened with inexplicable tension, thoughts
instinctively flashing through her mind, *Am I allowed to hear this?
Should I be hearing this?*

*If Gehrman Sparrow finds out I'm listening to what he's really like
inside, that he's even somewhat lively, would he blow my head off with a
gun?*

"Those are my impressions," Madam Justice concluded her recollections
and summary.

Madam Magician quietly let out a breath.

After calming down, she thought carefully and felt that if Gehrman
Sparrow was really as Miss Justice described, then probably, perhaps, he
wouldn't use violent means to eliminate people who knew his true nature.

Seeing that Madam Justice had said so much, Mr. Star, sitting next to
Lumian, leaned back against his chair, as if trying to enter a relaxed
state.

In a rich timbre, he intoned, "He is a learned person, and this is
reflected in more than just his being a university history graduate;

"In supernatural events, he was very green at first, but quickly became
skilled, becoming someone people could rely on;

"He's not comfortable getting too close to others, always maintaining a
certain distance, appearing as if he fears loss and doesn't want to gain
anything, but in reality, he's someone who values relationships deeply,
and inevitably relaxes over time, gradually integrating and carefully
building friendships with others;

"He's calm but not introverted, can take jokes and has a sense of humor,
values life and is willing to enjoy it, but doesn't like waste;

"He's cautious, perhaps due to the influence of the Seer pathway,
completely deserving to be called very cautious. When encountering
matters that aren't urgent and won't cause immediate harm, he chooses
the most conservative response, leaving first or waiting for backup, but
if a disaster is very pressing and will affect many people, even if he's
not powerful enough himself, he's willing to step forward and try to
resolve it despite the risks;

"He deeply values his brother and sister, is more relaxed around them,
and shows some of the personality traits Madam Justice just described;

"He is the best brother, both younger and older, and also the best
colleague..."

After Mr. Star finished speaking, the majestic palace remained silent
for quite a while, until all the Major Arcana card holders except Madam
Magician turned their gaze toward her.

Madam Magician cleared her throat and said, "My impressions of Gehrman
Sparrow can be read in 'The Great Adventurer' novel series.

"If I really have to summarize..."

This Angel of the Door pathway paused, her voice unconsciously becoming
softer.

"Cold, powerful, mysterious, and will kill people on the spot if they
say one wrong word.

"But, but very reliable---when you're with him, you only need to worry
about whether he might eliminate you, there's no need to worry about
anything else."

*You're closer to teasing than stating facts with that last part... I
can clearly hear that you're somewhat afraid, yet you still insist on
teasing both Gehrman Sparrow and yourself---is this the nature of
writers? Well, from 'The Great Adventurer' series, it's clear that you
respect, fear, and somewhat admire Gehrman Sparrow, yet you persistently
write gossip about him...* The Chariot Lumian, listening
quietly, couldn't help but think to himself.

After speaking quickly, Madam Magician turned her gaze to Mr. Hanged Man
sitting diagonally across from her, meaning it was his turn.

Mr. Hanged Man had already prepared his thoughts. "I haven't had much
contact with any of Mr. Fool's identities, and some I haven't met at
all, so I can only say briefly.

"An experienced, very intelligent, and powerful adventurer.

"His luck seems quite good too.

"Not actually as cold and hard as his exterior suggests.

"Willing to listen to others' opinions and respect their experience."

After Mr. Hanged Man finished, Madam Judgment, who appeared small
compared to her chair, shared her understanding, "Most of my impressions
of Gehrman Sparrow come from Madam Magician, so there's no need to
repeat them.

"I've had the most contact with the identity of Dwayne Dantès. He's a
mature, cultured, wealthy gentleman, but very mysterious, with unusual
things always happening around him.

"He's said to be romantic, fond of beautiful women with different
characteristics, but I haven't noticed him having any truly deep
relationships with any women.

"Well, he also has a kind heart, does charity work with genuine desire
to help others, and treats his male and female servants not just with
surface politeness, but actually without arrogance or hidden
discrimination..."

*This is also one side of Mr. Fool, especially certain details that
really reflect his inner nature...* Madam Justice carefully
memorized what the other Major Arcana card holders were saying, to
summarize and distill it later.

Mr. Sun, tall and wearing a plain white robe, followed by saying,
"Powerful but not arrogant, cold but not heartless.

"He practices all that is righteous, he's willing to take great risks to
help people who are actually of no use to him, he is light in the
darkness, a guide walking ahead, an angel sheltering everyone."

*A more religious description, with more extreme and pure emotions... As
expected of the Pope of the Church of The Fool and member of the New
City of Silver's six-member council...* Lumian could clearly
hear some differences.

Ma'am Hermit pushed up her glasses and said, "A very capable adventurer
who can always respond most appropriately to unexpected situations.

"He also yearns for something, he also gazes at the setting sun, and at
such times, I can truly feel his loneliness---what he wants to grasp
seems to be in a very distant, unreachable place.

"Also, a mysterious, powerful, and reliable companion."

The original Major Arcana card holders of the Tarot Club had finished
speaking, leaving only the two new members.

The Chariot Lumian, whose figure was blurred but still recognizably
female, thought for a moment before calmly saying, "I've never had any
real contact with any of Mr. Fool's identities in the real world, my
impressions of them all come from the materials you provided. I can only
speak from my interactions with Mr. Fool through certain dream images in
the dream city."

He was silent for a second before stating his first impression,
"Guardian."

Mr. Star, sitting beside him, suddenly spoke, as if sighing and
supplementing, "A guardian fighting against threats and madness."

Lumian nodded.

He strongly agreed with this description, especially after learning that
the Celestial Worthys spiritual imprint was indelible and eternal.

This addition also resonated with the other Major Arcana card holders,
and everyone fell into a new silence.

After a brief moment, Lumian shared his other impressions, "Gentle,
kind, elder brother, teacher, friend, a person with stories, a deity
with humanity."

After a pause, Lumian continued, "He values family and friends greatly,
he probably very much wants to return to the era he truly belongs to,
return to his homeland buried in history. He is lonely because of this,
often sad and in pain, and only family and friends he acknowledges can
help him find meaning in life.

"On the one hand detachment, on the other a deeper appreciation for life
experiences, willing to experience beauty..."

As he spoke, Lumian stopped, because he felt that the more he said, the
more he was thinking about how Aurore was the same way, and he worried
he might mix up some of Aurore's characteristics with Mr. Fool's,
affecting the Major Arcana card holders' summary of Gehrman Sparrow's
image.

*So it is indeed like this...* Madam Justice felt that some of
her private speculations and judgments made after understanding the
truth about transmigration were confirmed.

While memorizing, she felt that Gehrman Sparrow's image had become more
grounded, more detailed, and more well-rounded.

At this point, Madam Temperance, who couldn't easily speak due to her
sequence limitations, displayed the paper she had been writing on.

On the paper were words in ancient Feysac:

"My impressions are:

"Brave, decisive, extremely fast growth, increasingly reliable,
increasingly capable.

"Also, gentle, cultured, kind, rational, has a sense of justice, pursues
fairness, has sufficient sympathy for those in suffering and poverty,
and is willing to help, has a heart of mercy."

After reading the contents of Madam Temperance's paper, Madam Justice
thought quickly.

After a while, she spoke slowly, "Currently, the public's mainstream
impression of Gehrman Sparrow focuses on several labels:

"Great adventurer, cold and powerful, Angel of Redemption, Mr. Fool's
proxy, pirate killer.

"We don't need to change these for now. What we need to do is make these
labels richer, more detailed, and also show the complexity of human
nature."

The early impression that Gehrman Sparrow was a "lunatic" had basically
faded after the Church of The Fool widely publicized the matter of
redemption, and was no longer believed by most people.

Madam Justice continued, "Let's now start summarizing and unifying our
understanding.

"The first word I want to propose is 'guardian.'"

All the Major Arcana card holders, including Lumian, had no objections
to this.

Thus, after multiple discussions, those present reached a unified
understanding of Gehrman Sparrow's image: "Powerful, cautious,
mysterious background, loves money but also generous, gentle at heart,
shows mercy to people, redeems suffering, values family and
relationships, always misses his homeland, is Mr. Fool's proxy."

The Major Arcana card holders didn't add all the details to make the
description richer, as that would both make it difficult to spread and
easy to misinterpret---it was enough that they themselves had the
corresponding impressions.

Madam Magician thought for a moment and said, "I think we can add that
he has rich inner thoughts, likes to ramble, joke, and tease in his
mind.

"For the novel's text, this would be very interesting, and this is also
the true Gehrman Sparrow."

"That works." Madam Justice looked toward Madam Magician and smiled,
saying, "Then I'll trouble you to complete 'The Great Adventurer 7'
within two weeks."

"Alright." Madam Magician's body stiffened for a second, then she forced
a smile and said, "I've even thought of the promotional tagline, um,
'Want to see a more vivid and humane Gehrman Sparrow?'"
