## Chapter 882: The True Purpose

Seeing Voisin Sanson's eyes bulge, his breath gradually fading, his face
twisted in pain and palpable despair, Lumian reached behind into the
Traveler's Bag and took out the silver Lie earring, putting it on his
left ear.

The dying Voisin Sanson suddenly saw a familiar figure.

That figure had light blue eyes, beautiful features, and long, thick
golden hair.

It was Aurore.

But this time, there was no longer fear or terror on Aurore's face, only
a faint smile.

"Gasp..." Voisin Sanson uttered his final sound.

He died like that, with his eyes bulging.

Lumian returned to his original appearance, casually saying as he
removed the Lie earring, "You died so quickly? I wanted to thank you for
helping me digest the Despair potion."

When he had just advanced, the Despair potion was already mostly
digested, and now it had progressed even further.

Lumian wasn't surprised by this. According to the mystical knowledge he
had learned from Madam Magician, the essence of the acting method was
actually to gradually align one's mental and spiritual state with the
core symbolism of the potion through acting, thereby bypassing
restrictions and completing digestion step by step. His state before and
after taking the Despair potion could be said to be very close to the
name "Despair".

Lumian wasn't despairing about having to become a Demoness. For faster
advancement, better handling of possible apocalyptic scenarios, and
earlier resurrection of his sister, he had considered similar things
more than once. After all, he would have the chance to switch to the
Hunter pathway and become a man again later.

He despaired that he was forced to do this and had no way to refuse. He
despaired that his previous efforts, struggles, and anger were all under
someone else's arrangements, and that he would have to follow someone
else's arrangements to walk the path of the Demoness afterwards.

Of course, when despair reached its peak, the desire and belief in his
heart to become strong and change all this also intensified to the
extreme.

"Is this what you wanted too?" Lumian whispered self-mockingly as he
unsealed the area and let the remaining mystical pathogens dissipate
completely.

Franca, Jenna, and Anthony had already hurried over after Voisin Sanson
was impaled on the ice pillar.

Lumian suddenly sensed something and turned his gaze to a certain spot
in this dark ruin.

It was where the Order of All Extinction demigod Higdon had finally
died.

There, points of green light with yellow tinges appeared out of thin
air, rising upwards, only to be blocked by the barrier of the special
mirror world.

*This place preliminarily cuts off connections, preventing some bestowed
power from returning?* Lumian, with his experience, immediately
made the corresponding judgment.

By this time, Franca and the others had run up to him.

Looking at that familiar yet beautiful and cold face, Franca opened her
mouth, wanting to say something, but swallowed it back.

Jenna examined Lumian's current appearance, with only one thought in
mind: *It's good that he's still alive; it's best that everyone is still
alive!*

As for the rest, there was nothing to worry about.

Lumian pointed to those green lights with yellow tinges that were being
blocked, his voice slightly magnetic and distinctly feminine as he said,
"You can take a weapon over there and place it there."

This was actively creating a Beyonder weapon.

After Franca exchanged glances with Jenna and Anthony, she very
proactively said without any modesty, "I'll go; I'm just in need of a
weapon that can harm demigods."

She was the second highest Sequence Beyonder in the team---not counting
Ludwig.

If she had had a similar weapon earlier, she might not have been so
desperate when facing Higdon.

"Alright," Jenna expressed her attitude.

Anthony also nodded.

This didn't mean that if he put the Winter is Coming revolver under
those light spots, this Beyonder weapon would reset its usage count.
Given its own material composition, doing so would likely cause the
corruption to exceed the limit, making it disintegrate directly.

Franca took out her Cannon Gun and ran towards the area permeated with
green light spots with yellow tinges.

Lumian withdrew his gaze, looked at Jenna, and said with a slight smile,
"Do you have any ring-shaped items?"

Jenna, looking at that smile that seemed to radiate its own light, was a
bit surprised, but felt that now was not the time to ask.

She found a cheap silver bracelet and handed it to Lumian.

After taking it, Lumian placed the bracelet on top of Voisin Sanson's
corpse, waiting for the Inevitability power to be intercepted.

He then looked towards the distant transparent boundary that was like a
mirror, seeing his own figure and face.

He made an effort to bring a smile to the corners of his mouth.

Because Aurore was just such a person who excelled at finding joy in
suffering.

In front of the bloody altar, Ma'am Hermit was trying to find a way to
combine the iron cigar case bearing Mr. Fool's aura with the Spear of
Longinus to directly attack that oil painting depicting endless starry
skies. Madam Magician, based on her rich knowledge of seals and powerful
sealing abilities, carefully said, "The power of Inevitability is to
make the interference of non-vortex ritual participants fail, while that
terrifying voice affects all Beyonders similar to Listeners and Mystery
Pryers. We may be able to solve them separately.

"The power of Inevitability is most likely dissipating from that
circular ring on the oil painting. If we can plug it, shield it, we
should be able to break free from the fate of interference being
destined to fail, directly destroy the painting, and interrupt that
terrifying voice."

"Plug it..." Ma'am Hermit immediately had an idea upon hearing Miss
Justice's relay.

Taking advantage of the opportunity when the barrier seal was
strengthened and the power of inevitability was significantly weakened,
she cast a Warlock's spell, throwing that iron cigar case towards the
oil painting on the altar, making it land accurately on the area painted
with the silver-white ring with black edges.

The iron cigar case directly pressed down on that ring, shielding it,
without leaving any trace exposed.

The little boy, Will, immediately said, "The power of Inevitability has
decreased a lot more!"

Hearing this, Madam Magician quickly raised both arms, making the void
around that oil painting bend, becoming dark and deep.

That space subsequently collapsed, shattering inch by inch, along with
obvious cracks appearing on the oil painting and altar.

Miss Justice's face then protruded with patches of grayish-white scales,
her body seeming to swell.

Similarly, Madam Judgment once again made a judgment.

Seeing her companions all launching attacks, Ma'am Hermit once again
condensed that ancient spear stained with strange blood, throwing it
towards the oil painting.

The oil painting, already in tatters under continuous attacks, was
completely pierced by this Spear of Longinus, nailed to the altar.

Immediately after, flames that seemed to encompass all colors erupted
from the spear tip, completely igniting the oil painting that still had
terrifying sounds leaking out, gradually burning it to ashes.

Above Trier, one Worm of Time after another crawled back into Mr. Star's
body.

This Major Arcana card holder wearing red gloves said to Mr. Hanged Man
in his original magnetic voice, "Amon has returned, and briefly regained
the true god powers of the Error and Door pathways. I must return to the
Cathedral of Serenity immediately."

As soon as he finished speaking, Mr. Star instantly disappeared.

Mr. Hanged Man cast his gaze downward, seeing the "Moon" transformed
into crimson moonlight fall into the extremely compressed villa mist,
while Saint Viève of the Eternal Blazing Sun Church shone into it in the
form of sunlight.

†

Deep in the primitive island, outside the Black Emperor mausoleum.

Amon, at the edge of the astral world, looked down at Perle, at the
Shadow of the Beauty Goddess and the miniature crimson moon still
struggling to approach the corresponding light spots in the white mist,
without any action.

"What are you still waiting for?" Roselle, his face gradually deepening
in pain, asked.

"The same as what you're thinking now, the most arrogant thought you've
ever had." Amon pinched the monocle on his right eye and smiled in
response. "If it was just to eliminate the believers of Uncertain Mist,
there would be no need for such trouble, nor would it be worth us
revealing our trump cards."

Roselle glanced at the transaction still ongoing below and said, "That
could bring great hidden dangers."

"When you make a decision, you have to accept the corresponding
consequences. How can you accomplish something big without taking any
risks or bearing any losses?" Amon said with a smile, then added, "This
wasn't said by me, nor by you."

Before Roselle, who was being eroded more and more deeply and painfully
by the white mist, could respond, Amon looked into the distance and
said, "Those few from the Tarot Club are not bad, they don't need me to
personally descend to destroy that oil painting."

Saying this, Amon, wearing a monocle, showed an eager expression. "Now,
it's time."

He cast his gaze towards the Black Emperor mausoleum, towards Bernadette
who was being restricted by Roselle and unable to come out.

That Queen Mystic suddenly recalled something, feeling as if a certain
memory had parted the mist and revealed itself.

She immediately stretched out her right hand, quickly sketching out one
word after another bearing starlight in front of her.

These words, seemingly the source of all languages in the Northern and
Southern Continents, quickly intertwined into strange symbols, opening a
secret door that seemed to lead to the depths of the spirit world.

That secret door opened silently, and a gust of wind blew out,
transforming into a man with a human upper body and an airflow lower
body, wrapped in white cloth.

"The Magic Wishing Lamp and that item," Bernadette commanded in an
authoritative voice.

That man with an airflow lower body respectfully responded, then took
out two items from the white cloth wrapped around his body.

One looked like a miniature kettle, golden in color, covered with
mysterious and complex symbols, with something like a wick protruding
from the spout. This was 0-05---the Magic Wishing Lamp that the
believers of Uncertain Mist wanted to obtain.

The other was a gray stone tablet, also engraved with those words that
seemed to be the source of all languages in the Northern and Southern
Continents, with numerous traces on its surface, mottled and ancient.
