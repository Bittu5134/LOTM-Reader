## Chapter 1091: Chaos's Future

"A hidden fourth Pillar?" Madam Magician exclaimed in shock.

She clearly had never heard of this before.

The Chariot Lumian was equally surprised.

He couldn't help but glance at Madam Magician, muttering internally,
*Her humanity is well-preserved...*

Mr. Fool, shrouded in grayish-white fog, explained in a calm tone, "This
world was born from chaos. Besides the astral world's dominator, the
spirit world's lord, and reality's sovereign, there is another important
symbolism---one that represents the endpoint of destiny, the universe's
destruction, and the finale of all things. Under such a symbolism, even
the Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings and the Mother
Goddess of Depravity would completely perish, Their spirits no longer
existing, everything returning to chaos. Of course, the hidden fourth
Pillar would meet the same fate, not much later than us.

"Or rather, Its self-destruction brings about all termination."

"Mr. Fool, which sefirot does this correspond to?" Madam Magician
curiously asked, beating The Chariot Lumian to the question.

Mr. Fool's fingers lightly tapped the edge of the bronze long table.
"Formed by the convergence of two sefirot---one is the City of Calamity,
the other the River of Eternal Darkness."

Madam Magician immediately looked across at The Chariot Lumian.

The Chariot Lumian's heart stirred, raising his right hand and gazing at
the pitch-black, lifeless "pinhole" in his palm.

Mr. Fool continued, "The best way to transcend the Sequences is first to
become a Sequence 0 true god of one pathway, then accommodate the
corresponding sefirah, followed by the Uniquenesses of other pathways
under the sefirah and Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristics, with no
ritual to assist.

"This is the general approach, though some pathways have their own
unique details, like the Demoness and Hunter pathways. But ultimately,
one must first become a Sequence 0 true god of a pathway to accommodate
the sefirah, not become a dual-pathway true god before attempting. The
latter has hope of success, but not a great chance.

"When the Red Priest or the Primordial Demoness accommodates the City of
Calamity and continues to occupy the neighboring pathway's Uniqueness
and one Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristic, becoming the Origins of
Disaster or Calamity of Destruction, and then accommodates the River of
Eternal Darkness along with its pathway's Uniquenesses and Sequence 1
Beyonder characteristics, they can become the hidden fourth Pillar,
becoming the endpoint of destiny and the universe's destroyer.

"Conversely, the Sequence 0 true gods of Darkness, Death, and Twilight
Giant pathways can also become the hidden fourth Pillar, starting from
accommodating the River of Eternal Darkness.

"Now, the Evernight Goddess has already obtained the Uniquenesses of the
Twilight Giant and Death pathways and grasps all the required Sequence 1
Beyonder characteristics. She is deepening Her connection with that
sefirah by using the tributary leaked from the seal through the
Underworld Daoist and the River of Eternal Darkness."

*Through the Underworld Daoist...* Lumian suddenly understood
the value the Church of Evernight's emphasis had with Amandina.

In the past half year, they hadn't had much contact with her, but they
knew her general situation.

The Church of Evernight Goddess had directly established contact with
this Underworld Daoist's student, personally managed by Mr. Star. The
current Amandina had obtained the Sequence 5 Spirit Medium Beyonder
ingredients, was digesting the Spirit Warlock potion, preparing for her
advancement ritual, and waiting to receive a new round of boons at the
end-of-year Dream Festival.

Her relationship with the Church of Evernight Goddess had become very
close.

Just as Lumian was suddenly worried, Mr. Fool continued, "You should
have realized that the hidden fourth Pillar is related to the universe's
destruction and the termination of all things, and would not normally
appear.

"As for whether we will need to wait until the universe reaches the end
of life before the City of Calamity and River of Eternal Darkness can
merge and give birth to the fourth Pillar, or if the fourth Pillar can
be forcibly born through congregation but would bring about the universe
and all things' destruction---unless He immediately falls into slumber
or passively splits---everything will perish. I can't see clearly yet,
but the deity worshiped by the Aurora Order currently leans more towards
the latter scenario."

*In other words, the hidden fourth Pillar will either be unable to be
born for a very long time, or can only be used as a final option of
mutual destruction or intimidating enemies?* The Chariot Lumian
gradually felt relieved.

Then, he pondered the purpose and implications of Mr. Fool's explanation
about the hidden fourth Pillar.

*For me, this knowledge is currently meaningless...*

*Or perhaps, I can first jump to Sequence 1 of Death or Twilight Giant
to better borrow the power of 0-01, narrowing the gap between myself and
Red Angel Medici?*

*If I could defeat this King of Angels, obtain two Sequence 1 Beyonder
characteristics of the Hunter pathway from Him, then find a way to lower
my status, expel the original Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristic, return
to the Weather Warlock level, and then re-advance, becoming a King of
Angels of the Hunter pathway, accommodating 0-01...*

*Lowering my status and re-advancing has significant risks and potential
hidden dangers, but it's much better than competing with Red Angel
Medici at Sequence 2... However, I won't challenge the Red Angel
one-on-one. I'm a Major Arcana of the Tarot Club, a patron saint---no, a
patron angel of the Church of The Fool. Hunters are about collective
strength, so why would I fight alone?*

*After Franca and Jenna's advancement, if the ritual is difficult or
Beyonder characteristics are unavailable, they could also consider
switching to one of the Darkness, Death, or Twilight Giant
pathways...*

While The Chariot Lumian was contemplating, Mr. Fool looked at him and
said, "After switching to a hidden neighboring pathway, if you don't
expel the corresponding Beyonder characteristics, you'll be unable to
accommodate the sefirah in the future and will be rejected by the
belonging sefirah.

"Also, after becoming a Weather Warlock, your destiny has become chaotic
and full of change. I am not omniscient, nor omnipotent. I can no longer
see things as clearly and can only remind you to be extremely careful
going forward."

When he advanced to Weather Warlock, Lumian had already confirmed that
the remaining spiritual imprint of Blood Emperor Alista Tudor had not
been strengthened or revived within him.

From that point, he knew the Blood Emperor's resurrection arrangement
would emerge and erupt in subsequent events, which were currently
unforeseeable. Mr. Fool's warning deepened his vigilance in this aspect:

An arrangement that even this great existence cannot provide effective
guidance must be extraordinarily complex!

Madam Magician Fors, who had chatted with Mr. Fool many times, knew from
his last statement that today's small gathering, or the "common
knowledge" lesson for the Tarot Club's new angel, should conclude.

She looked at The Chariot Lumian and said, "You should now understand
the current situation and the source of the apocalypse. Analyzing things
afterward will allow you to directly see their essence.

"As an Angel more senior than you by several years, let me share three
final experiences.

"First, previous Sequences must be acted upon again because the potion
you consumed contains Beyonder characteristics from all previous
Sequences. Most importantly, you need to make up for the acting of
Iron-blooded Knight and War Bishop. Hunter, Provoker, Pyromaniac,
Conspirer and Reaper can all be naturally and effectively digested in
your future battles or wars.

"Second, travel to different regions to improve local weather and leave
behind legends. This is not only necessary for digesting the Weather
Warlock potion but also a must-do to spread faith and obtain more
anchors.

"Third, Mr. Fool has already explained the difference between godhood
and humanity very clearly. Combining my own experience, I have one
insight: distinguish between the normal desires brought by the second
layer of humanity, and the abnormal desires created by first-layer
humanity and godhood. Resist the latter, guide the former. Don't be too
suppressed and restrained, nor can you be greedy and indulgent."

The Chariot Lumian listened carefully and thoughtfully said, "Thank you,
Madam Magician."

Madam Magician Fors smiled self-deprecatingly. "If you have any new
insights in this area later, you can tell me too.

"I need to prepare for my Sequence 1 advancement."

"Sequence 1 of the Door pathway?" The Chariot Lumian asked with slight
surprise.

In his view, the Sequence 2 Planeswalker of the Door pathway was the
Sequence most likely to survive the apocalypse, without question.

First, before reaching Sequence 1, they wouldn't be specifically
targeted by the Outer Deities. Second, They possessed the ability for
space travel and could carry a group of people. Afterward, They could
completely find a planet in a "remote" area of the universe with
relatively suitable conditions, and use Their recording abilities or the
Beyonder characteristics of different pathways to make it habitable and
redevelop civilization.

Madam Magician nodded. "Yes, the Key of Stars. The Beyonder
characteristics and supplementary ingredients are not lacking. The
Abraham family has long wanted to give them to me. The price is to
protect their clan, prevent the Abraham name from going extinct, ensure
at least one Sequence 1 Angel is born among them. Afterward, if the
apocalypse comes, my first task would be to transfer them away.

"The good news is they now have several Saints. The bad news is they are
far from digestion. The Sequence 3 Wanderer still needs to travel in
space to digest quickly.

"The ritual itself isn't complicated. Find a continuously rotating,
signal-emitting heavy planet, approach it, land on it, and then find a
way to establish sufficient mystical connections with it.

"The first part of the ritual is very dangerous, the latter part
extremely difficult. But with Mr. Fool's help, these aren't major
problems---He can directly Graft me onto the corresponding planet to
satisfy the conditions, though the premise is that I can withstand such
pressure.

"The current trouble is that my Planeswalker potion hasn't been
completely digested. These years I've been going everywhere, the number
of times is enough, and the term 'walker' is satisfied, but none of it
counts as planeswalking..."

At this point, Madam Magician suddenly closed her mouth.

She felt like she was complaining about work, and her direct
superior---who could easily crush her---was sitting at the head of the
long table.

Listening to Madam Magician's words, Lumian suddenly discovered a
problem.

*Mr. Fool doesn't actually have to deal with the subsequent planetary
apocalypse, because no Outer Deity would compete for Sefirah
Castle---accommodating this sefirah with a Pillar symbolism would only
lead Them to self-destruction...*
