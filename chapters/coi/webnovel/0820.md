## Chapter 820: Walking into a Trap

As Jenna used the Abyss Shackles spell from the Arrow of the
Bloodthirsty, shadows and darkness came to life beside the coughing
Nikila. Under the yellowish light of the gas wall lamp, they coalesced
into black chains that wrapped around the Moses Ascetic Order member,
binding him firmly in place, even sealing his mouth.

Nikila, experienced in combat, immediately formed a slowly rotating mass
of stardust in his right palm. The light in the room dimmed as if night
had fallen outside.

In the dimness, numerous bright stars appeared, not densely packed but
numerous enough.

They cast beams of light that converged into a thick column,
illuminating the entire room and enveloping Nikila.

The black chains formed by the Abyss Shackles disintegrated like shadows
meeting sunlight, and Nikila dissolved rapidly in the light column,
shattering into countless glass shards.

Mirror Substitution!

Using his unique abilities, Nikila escaped the Abyss Shackles by
attacking himself. As a Mystery Pryer pathway Beyonder, many of his
spells required incantations. With his mouth sealed, his abilities were
significantly limited.

As a result, Jenna confirmed that Nikila was a Mirror Person.

Black fog emanated from her back, growing into a pair of large, illusory
bat wings.

These Wings of Darkness transformed into a swarm of palm-sized,
insubstantial vampire bats that flew through the walls and door towards
the newly freed Nikila.

Meanwhile, Anthony ended his Psychological Invisibility, kicking open
the door while aiming a complex, mechanically beautiful black revolver
at Nikila.

Winter is Coming!

Anthony was preparing to use the Certain Death effect of this Beyonder
weapon.

He didn't intend to actually use it because Nikila's Mirror Substitution
ability could prematurely activate, causing the deadly bullet to hit the
mirror instead.

Anthony's current objective was to use a Warlock's acute spirituality
warnings and mystery-prying eyes to make Nikila feel his life was in
danger, forcing him to escape through the mirror world.

According to Franca, Nikila, likely a Sequence 5 Constellations Master
from the Mystery Pryer pathway and possibly a Mirror Person, would
undoubtedly sense the danger of the Winter is Coming revolver and
recognize its godhood-possessing attack.

To genuinely trigger the target's spirituality warning, Anthony needed
to complete a psychological suggestion on himself, a simple task for a
Hypnotist.

Thus, Anthony was genuinely planning to shoot, fully intending to use
the Certain Death effect. However, when his finger began to pull the
trigger, it would activate the preset psychological warning, canceling
the suggestion and allowing him to fire a normal bullet.

Just as Franca predicted, the moment Nikila saw the Winter is Coming
revolver, a hint of deep purple appeared in his pitch-black eyes,
reflecting the weapon's decaying aura.

He instantly felt a creeping sense of death, his throat itching more
intensely, and a weakness spreading through his body.

This wasn't an effect of Winter is Coming but a backlash from seeing the
secret of the Beyonder weapon, combined perfectly with the pathogen
Franca spread when she extended her hand through the mirror, worsening
Nikila's condition.

Without considering further, Nikila immediately let a mirror substitute
himself.

*Bang!*

Anthony pulled the trigger, firing a yellow bullet with only a disease
effect, which, along with the swarm of vampire bats, hit Nikila, causing
a shattering sound.

Nikila, now visible in another corner of the room, had no intention of
counterattacking. His only thought was to flee immediately.

This was partly because he was unsure if there were more attackers and
partly because the gun's danger kept him on high alert.

Unable to assess the situation clearly and knowing the enemy had a
demigod-level weapon, he had no choice but to escape.

Nikila quickly lunged towards the nearest mirror, aiming to use the
mirror world to escape the battle.

Noticing his move, Jenna slowed her attacks, while Anthony's eyes turned
gold, displaying spiraling whirlpools that seemed to penetrate the soul.

Battle Hypnotism!

This spell forcibly hypnotized an enemy during combat, making them
perform abnormal actions, but it could not directly harm the hypnotized
and didn't last long.

Anthony's intent was only to make Nikila switch mirrors, delaying his
escape without directly endangering him.

Nikila hesitated, suddenly feeling the mirror might hide a dangerous
trap.

He quickly pulled out a scroll with gold foil from the inside pocket of
his black wool coat and softly chanted a Hermes word, "Sun!"

The scroll was instantly consumed by golden flames, erupting into
blinding sunlight that turned all the vampire bats to smoke.

This severely affected Jenna and Anthony's vision, their eyes filled
with dazzling sunlight.

Nikila seized the moment, rolling towards the full-length mirror in the
living room and diving in.

From the start of Battle Hypnotism to his escape, it took only two or
three seconds.

The sunlight quickly faded, and Anthony nodded at Jenna.

Jenna immediately grabbed her companion's shoulder, activating the
Seven-Stone Bracelet on her left wrist.

One of the two remaining diamonds burst into clear light, enveloping
them both.

In the next second, Jenna and Anthony teleported to the quarry chamber
with the fixed mirror world entrance, pressing their hands against the
protruding rock.

___

Nikila, just entering the void and dark area behind the mirror, couldn't
help but cough.

The disease he had contracted couldn't be removed by Mirror
Substitution.

*Cough! Cough! Cough!* As he coughed violently, he felt
invisible threads binding his body layer by layer.

*Spider webs from a Demoness?* Nikila shuddered.

Jenna had been deliberately using the Arrow of the Bloodthirsty to
attack this Mirror Person to hide her identity as a Demoness, preventing
Nikila from suspecting he was being targeted by Demonesses.

Otherwise, he would suspect a trap behind the mirror, abandoning the
mirror world escape plan and rendering Anthony's Battle Hypnotism
ineffective.

As his pupils dilated, Nikila reflexively formed a slowly rotating mass
of stardust in his right palm.

Before he could use his Constellations Master abilities to destroy
himself and the Demoness webs in this area, he felt invisible threads
lightly caressing him, from his ears and face to his chest and inner
thighs, teasing and scratching with seductive touches.

This instantly sent his blood surging, his thoughts sinking deep to his
nether regions.

As he struggled to regain control and use his abilities, he saw a figure
at the edge of the web-like tunnel.

The figure wore a black robe with leather armor, the hood askew,
revealing a pair of heroic and beautiful eyebrows, clear bright eyes
like lake water, and moist red lips.

This indescribable beauty and soul-stirring charm made Nikila
instinctively hold his breath, forgetting to resist, forgetting to break
free.

Demoness of Affliction's Charm!

The intense danger warning allowed Nikila to barely break free from this
bewitching beauty. Clenching his teeth, suppressing the desire from the
teasing and seductive touches, he was about to activate the stardust
whirlpool in his hand.

Franca continued her Charm, a slight smile on her lips, stunning Nikila
while changing the action of some webs. They started tickling him!

"Ha... ha... ha!" Sensitive spots on his neck, armpits, and waist were
attacked, making him laugh uncontrollably, tears streaming down his
face.

If not for the invisible threads binding him tightly, he would have
retreated, twisted his body, or rolled on the ground.

In this state, it was nearly impossible for Nikila to use any of his
abilities.

Of course, his desire also faded because of this.

*Right now, I really do feel like a black widow spider, methodically
dealing with prey caught in its web... At the Demoness of Affliction
stage, if the prey is truly ensnared without help, they'll be constantly
affected, unable to escape by their own means... It's a pity this
doesn't work on Hunters; they can ignite flames to burn the web... I
wonder when I'll be able to directly transmit genuine pleasure through
the webs...* Franca maintained her vigilance, watching the
frantically laughing Nikila, muttering to herself.

Her strategy was clear: restrain the enemy, continually interfere with
his efforts, and delay him until his illness flared up or he was
completely charmed.

During this process, even if Nikila used Mirror Substitution, he would
be limited by the distance, with his body reappearing within the area
covered by the Demoness webs, repeating the initial experience.

Previously, Franca had already turned this place into a Demoness's nest.

On one side, he was continuously tickled, while on the other, his desire
was stoked by teasing touches. Nikila oscillated between hell and
paradise, in extreme agony.

The beautiful figure, seemingly forever out of reach, became a symbol of
all his hopes and dreams.

Nikila knew he couldn't continue like this. Resolving to endure the
laughter, he bit his tongue hard.

The pain pierced his mind, momentarily freeing him from all influences.

He tightened his grip on the stardust whirlpool.

In the void and darkness behind the mirror, one brilliant star after
another lit up.
