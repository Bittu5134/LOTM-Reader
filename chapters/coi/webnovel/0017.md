## Chapter 17: Suspect

Lumian was on edge, his mind racing with excitement and fear. "What is
it exactly?"

The woman took a leisurely sip of Venus Sacred Oil before replying in a
calm, unhurried tone.

"You have to ask yourself that."

Having said that, she lowered her head slightly and focused on enjoying
her breakfast, giving the impression that she had no intention of
continuing the conversation.

*Why do you keep parts of the matter untold and only answer at the next
opportunity? Isn't this a waste of everyone's time?* He couldn't
help but feel inferior to her ability to infuriate others.

Taking a deep breath, he forced a smile and bade farewell.

Lumian obediently spent the rest of the day at home.

This wasn't out of fear of the owl to the point of not daring to step
out during the day, nor was it because he had nothing to do, but to
avoid arousing suspicion.

Lumian was determined to get to the bottom of the help-seeking letter
that Leah and her companions had in their possession. He needed to find
out what was written and who wrote it. The key to his investigation was
to flip through every *livre bleu* in the village and find the
one with words cut out. As a villager, Lumian was best suited for this
task, but he was hesitant to proceed after talking to the three
foreigners. It could attract someone's attention and cause unnecessary
trouble.

This was a matter of life and death, survival or doom, and Lumian knew
that even with Aurore's protection, he couldn't guarantee that the other
party wouldn't take any risky actions against him.

In the past two years, he had become better at figuring out the
threshold required for pranks.

This was due to his rich experience.

He planned on "visiting" every family in a few days, using the excuse of
pursuing the legends related to Lent.

After dinner, when it was dark, Aurore returned to her bedroom to
finally write a manuscript that was long overdue.

Lumian entered the study planning to find some books related to dreams
to read, hoping to gain some special inspiration for his dream.

As they only had one battery-powered table lamp at home, which was being
used by Aurore, he had to light up the kerosene lamp that had a pungent
smell and was not great for illumination purposes.

Carrying the kerosene lamp that emitted a dim yellow glow, Lumian
quickly swiped his other hand across the backs of the books.
Occasionally, he would choose a book and clamp it under his armpit.

After a while, he returned to the table with three selected books.

Just as he placed the books in his hand, Lumian saw the *livre
bleu* at home.

It was quietly placed in a corner of the desk as usual, and the
gray-blue cover seemed a little dusty.

Upon seeing this *livre bleu*, Lumian instantly thought of the
book he had obtained in the dream ruins and the book that had been cut
and meshed into a plea for help.

He reached out and picked up the *livre bleu* in front of him,
planning to flip through the content to see which words were suitable
for cutting and piecing into useful sentences.

After flipping through a few pages, Lumian's gaze froze.

There was an obvious hole in the notes attached to the current calendar
page.

A word had been cut out!

"No way..." Lumian whispered, extremely shocked.

He quickly flipped through the *livre bleu* in his hand and
found more than ten words cut out.

"No way..." Lumian whispered again, his reaction almost the same as
before.

The *livre bleu* that Ryan, Leah, Valentine, and the others were
searching for turned out to be the one at home!

Not only had they not expected it, but Lumian had never even fathomed
this possibility!

It didn't even cross his mind!

Amidst the indescribably complicated emotions, Lumian frowned.

*Could it be Aurore who requested help?*

*Why did she seek help from the officials? Why didn't she tell
me?*

Based on Leah and the others' behavior, their habitual choice to discuss
matters with the padre as soon as they arrived, and other details,
Lumian made a preliminary judgment that they were officials. They could
be from the government, Dariège's Eternal Blazing Sun Church, or the God
of Steam and Machinery Church.

Lumian hesitated, his expression constantly changing.

Finally, he made up his mind. He took the *livre bleu* and
walked out of the study to Aurore's bedroom.

He planned on asking her directly and chose to believe in Aurore.

*Knock! Knock! Knock! *Lumian bent his finger and knocked on the
door.

"Come on in." Aurore's voice sounded.

Lumian turned the handle and pushed open the door to enter. Under the
bright light of the table lamp, Aurore, who was wearing a two-piece
cotton pajama set, had bound her golden hair with a headband and was
engrossed in writing a story.

"Did you cut this?" Lumian asked, interrupting his sister before she
could speak.

"Huh?" Aurore turned around in confusion, her eyes blank and distant, as
if she was still deep in thought.

Lumian handed over the *livre bleu*, which had been flipped to
the corresponding page, and stared into Aurore's eyes.

"You didn't cut this?"

Aurore gazed at it carefully for a few seconds before looking up in
amusement.

"Would I be so bored and childish? I'm steady, mature, and broadminded,
unlike you."

*Aurore's reaction was natural, and she didn't seem surprised or
flustered that her secret had been exposed.* Lumian didn't hide
his confusion and asked, "But who would have cut out words from the
*livre bleu*?"

"Wasn't it you?" Aurore sized up her brother. "After reading my novel,
you planned on mimicking what you read and cut out words from books and
newspapers to create a random letter to play a huge prank on the
village. But before that, you wanted to see if you could fool me? Are
you testing my deductive abilities?"

*This really doesn't seem like Aurore's doing...* Lumian's gaze
was fixed on Aurore's face, not letting go of even the slightest change
in her expression, but his sister's performance was flawless.

"It wasn't me." Lumian frowned. "Who could have done it?"

Aurore smiled. "Go on and play your little game of deduction. I have a
manuscript to finish. If I have time tomorrow, I'll help you figure out
the truth."

*Using extraordinary means?* Lumian tersely acknowledged her
words and stopped disturbing his sister's creation.

He took the *livre bleu* and returned to his unlit room, sitting
on the chair behind the desk.

"Who could it be?" Under the illumination of the crimson moon, Lumian
muttered, trying to make deductions.

*We are a family of two. Aurore is a Warlock with extraordinary
abilities. She won't let others ransack our home...*

*If it's really not her, and in her words, 'when you have eliminated the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
truth.'*

*So, in the case of having only two choices, I'm actually the one who
did this?*

For a moment, Lumian found it absurd and funny.

*So I'm the 'criminal'?*

*Why don't I know that?*

Lumian couldn't help but turn his body and look at the full-body mirror
attached to the wardrobe.

Under the crimson moonlight, his mirror reflection was wearing a linen
shirt and brown pants. His handsome features didn't have a smile on
them, and his expression was abnormally heavy.

He was very sure that he had never cut out the content from the *livre
bleu*.

To eliminate the possibility, he recalled his experiences in the past
month.

Although many details were already a blur, he was still very certain
about what he had done.

Bathing in the crimson moon's light that seeped in through the windows,
Lumian muttered to himself, "Could it be that I did it when I was
unconscious? While having that dream, I can sleepwalk in reality? No,
that's impossible. Aurore said that she would watch me. If I really
sleepwalked and cut the livre bleu, she would have pointed it out just
now. Moreover, the letter must have been sent during the day. I'm very
awake during those times."

Lumian eliminated himself and thought of other possibilities.

*Someone else who came here, perhaps?*

Although their family had few guests usually, it did not mean that they
did not have any.

Firstly, poorer neighbors would come to borrow the stove or oven to
smoke meat or make bread.

Secondly, Lumian's friends would come to his house from time to time to
find some simple novels to read or listen to his stories.

Lastly, Nazélie, Madame Pualis, and a few other ladies visited Aurore
from time to time to have a chat with her. Among them, Madame Pualis
came the most. She even lent Aurore a pony so that Aurore could ride
freely in the mountains. They were quite close.

After all, in a village like Cordu, only an author like Aurore was
worthy of Madame Pualis' friendship.

Madame Pualis appeared very amiable on the surface, often basking in the
sun with the other women and chatting with them, and even catching lice
with them. She had a good reputation in the village.

Although Madame Pualis and Aurore could be considered friends, Lumian
did not like her at all. Madame Pualis would often introduce one of her
relatives to Aurore and persuade her to get married and have children as
soon as possible.

It would be fine if Madame Pualis' relatives were nice, but every time
Lumian asked around in Dariège, he found that the other party either had
bad character or was not very capable. They were about to fall into
poverty, and none of them made the cut.

The first time might have been a coincidence, but with it happening
every time, Lumian bore a hatred for Madame Pualis.

*It's definitely impossible for those who come here to smoke meat or
bake bread. There's always someone watching them. They won't be allowed
to go up to the second floor... Reimund, Ava, and the others are also
unlikely suspects. I'll accompany them the entire time. Madame Pualis,
Nazélie, and the other ladies have a certain chance. Every time they
come, Aurore will keep them in the study to read while she prepares some
snacks...*

*If Madame Pualis is really a Witch, then it's understandable that she
needs to hide her identity from the authorities. Also, she is very
careful to use other people's livre bleu to avoid being traced back to
her...*

*Did she discover something when she was having an affair with the
padre? Did she have to protect herself in this way?*

The more he thought about it, the more excited he became. He felt like
he was about to lock onto a suspect.

He stood up, paced a few steps, and suddenly walked downstairs.

He didn't want to question Madame Pualis, nor did he plan to pry into
her actions now. Instead, he planned to find Reimund or Guillaume-junior
and use their *livre bleu* as a comparison to determine which
words had been cut out and what sentence could be formed.

This way, Lumian could recreate the exact content of the request for
help.

He rushed down the stairs, through the kitchen, and opened the front
door.

The crimson darkness outside rushed in, instantly calming him down.

"Uh, Grande Soeur said that before we figure out the owl's situation, I
shouldn't go out after dark..." Lumian muttered. He took two steps back
and closed the door.

Anyway, there was no hurry to borrow the *livre bleu*. It would
be more natural to do it tomorrow.

After doing a stretch, Lumian walked towards the staircase.

*Ding ding ding ding ding.*

The doorbell rang, the sound echoing through the house.

"Who is it?" Lumian turned around in confusion, calling out as he walked
towards the door.

A slightly magnetic and gentle female voice sounded from outside.

"It's me, Pualis de Roquefort."
