## Chapter 189: Cooperation

Observing Lumian's perplexed gaze, Franca provided a succinct
explanation, "One of the core abilities of the Demoness pathway revolves
around mirrors and manipulating the world within them.

"When I suspected that this place might be connected to the Demoness or
Hunter pathway, I pondered whether we inadvertently stepped into a
certain location within the mirror world. Thus, I attempted to use the
makeup mirror to see if I could escape through it. As you witnessed, it
proved fruitless.

"Because of this, I have tentatively dismissed the notion of being in a
mirror world or encountering a relic belonging to a Demoness. However,
now we have stumbled upon a submerged mirror that likely conceals an
exit..."

"So, you suspect that this is a specific place within the mirror world,
restricted to certain mirrors?" Lumian attempted to grasp Franca's line
of thinking.

"Exactly," Franca replied with a gentle nod. "But what perplexes me is
how we found ourselves here without encountering anything resembling a
mirror. Perhaps my conjecture is incorrect, or only partially true..."

Lumian pondered for a moment, hoping to glean some knowledge. He posed a
sincere question: "What exactly is a mirror world?"

Franca grabbed the ponytail at the back of her head.

"Explaining it to you is a challenge since I am not entirely certain
myself.

"Allow me to elucidate based on my understanding. In mysticism, mirrors
possess distinct symbolic meanings, such as one's reflection or an
entrance to another realm. The former suggests that we can use mirrors
to create substitutes, while the latter alludes to a mirror world.

"It is often associated with terror, mystery, horror, and the bizarre. I
cannot ascertain whether there are hidden elements or if it truly
represents an alternate dimension. However, I do know that the mirror
world connects to various mirror-like entities. It could potentially
point to spaces that are typically inaccessible. As my Sequence
progresses, I should be capable of utilizing the mirror world to swiftly
traverse different locations."

Lumian recalled the recent events and allowed his imagination to run
wild.

"Could the version of you we saw be a reflection left behind in the
mirror world from a previous encounter, before you became a Witch? That
would explain why I have never encountered my past self."

"That is a plausible explanation, but I haven't come across anything
peculiar..." Franca deliberated for a moment. "If that is the case, we
must hurry to the puddle immediately. The exit is most likely there! We
can no longer afford to proceed cautiously or wait any longer. As I
mentioned earlier, the mirror world harbors eerie and terrifying
phenomena. If we linger here any further, I dread to imagine what might
befall us!"

"Very well." Lumian maintained his composure.

Franca turned and sprinted, with Lumian closely following her.

As the Witch ran, it appeared as though she employed some form of
ability. Small patches of frost materialized beneath her feet, causing a
sharp reduction in friction. Her body seemed weightless as she
gracefully glided through the dim quarry cave and into the depths of the
underground tunnel.

Utilizing all his strength as a Hunter and Dancer, Lumian struggled to
keep pace with Franca and avoid being left behind.

In the wintry chill, a thin layer of ice gradually formed on the walls
of the surrounding rocks.

Upon the icy surface, visages stained with blood emerged. Their
countenances contorted, eyes brimming with hatred, resembling vengeful
specters emerging from the depths of hell.

Among them was the previous incarnation of Franca, when she still
appeared as a man!

After sprinting for a while, Lumian and Franca caught sight of the
puddle.

As the light from the carbide lamp cast its glow, the puddle's surface
shimmered with a tinge of yellowish-blue.

"Is this it?" Franca halted abruptly.

Lumian examined it for a moment before responding, "Yes."

In that moment, every fiber of his being throbbed with pain, as if his
body was on the brink of bursting, save for the fiery sensation in his
nasal cavity.

Holding the carbide lamp tightly, Franca cautiously approached the
puddle.

"The challenge now is how to elude the monster you encountered and
locate the mirror. Regrettably, I cannot yet traverse between mirrors. I
can only remain inside for a few fleeting seconds...

"I will divert its attention and keep it occupied for a while. Why don't
you dive underwater and retrieve the mirror?"

Lumian spoke plainly, "I don't believe you stand a chance against it. It
nearly overwhelmed me when I caught a glimpse of it."

"..." Though Franca felt a twinge of annoyance and frustration, she had
to acknowledge that Lumian spoke the truth.

With her Sequence and mystical item, she could still hold her ground
even against a Beyonder one rank higher. However, judging by the
monster's display, it far surpassed her by more than a single rank!

After a brief pause, Franca clenched her teeth and uttered,

"Even if I am outmatched, my skills in escape and self-preservation are
formidable. I should be able to hold out against it for more than ten
seconds. If you can retrieve the mirror within that timeframe, we can
make our escape!"

Lumian let out a chuckle.

"We shouldn't risk our lives just yet.

"I have a plan to stall that monster for ten to twenty seconds without
taking excessive risks. And I trust you can locate that mirror,
correct?"

"I'm capable. I have a unique method of detecting mirrors," Franca eyed
Lumian skeptically. "Are you truly up to the task? Is there genuinely no
danger involved?"

"In theory, the risks are minimal," Lumian replied calmly.

Simultaneously, he silently added, *If the risks prove too great, I'll
find an alternative. Mr. K, Madame Hela, Madam Magician, the great
being, and the power of Inevitability are all viable options.*

Franca wasted no time and pursed her lips as she spoke, "Alright, just
to be safe, I'll create a Mirror Substitute for you."

Naturally, Lumian had no objections to something that could effectively
reduce the risk.

After Franca produced a small mirror and crafted the corresponding
substitute, Lumian gripped the ritual silver dagger and encircled the
pond-like puddle, creating a spiritual barrier.

Throughout the process, he maintained a distance of four to five meters
from the water's edge, fearing the monster would drag him under.

Putting away the ritual silver dagger, Lumian turned to Franca with a
genuine smile.

"What comes next involves one of my secrets. Could you turn around?"

"Very well." Franca was content with his straightforwardness.

She inwardly sighed once more.

*Does Jenna misunderstand Ciel?*

As Franca turned around, Lumian placed the carbide lamp aside and began
the Summoning Dance.

He intended to summon the monster, but he wouldn't allow it to possess
him!

Lumian believed that the higher the level of a peculiar creature, the
more aware it would be of the corruption within his body. This made it
less inclined to attach itself to him.

In other words, as long as he refrained from issuing commands that would
influence the monster, it was likely to observe the Summoning Dance
eagerly, waiting for an opportunity to attack. However, it was
intimidated by the seal and the corruption and dared not act upon its
thoughts. It would only truly engage him once the dance concluded.

The Summoning Dance lasted for 20 to 30 seconds, ample time for Franca
to submerge herself and locate the mirror.

As long as Lumian could escape this world before the monster attacked,
there would be no further issues!

Of course, if he couldn't harness the corresponding powers of nature in
this place and allow the Summoning Dance to take effect, he could always
employ an alternative method.

Amidst the contorted and frenzied dance, Lumian's spirituality stirred
the forces of nature, forming a connection that dissipated into the
surroundings, only to be obstructed by the spiritual barrier.

After a few seconds, ripples appeared on the surface of the puddle, and
a pallid figure emerged, floating above the water.

It bore a resemblance to a human, with an inflated body and a gargantuan
face occupying half its form.

The monster floated toward Lumian and came to a stop in close proximity.

Lumian dared not gaze directly at it. With his eyes half-shut, he called
out, "Hurry!"

Without hesitation, Franca discarded the carbide lamp, took two steps,
and leaped into the water.

With a splash, water splattered around.

A cold, damp sensation penetrated Franca's skin as near darkness
enveloped her vision.

Guided by the faint glow of the carbide lamp seeping through the water,
Franca swiftly descended to the depths.

Suddenly, dark creatures resembling seaweed extended their hair-like
tendrils, slithering around Franca as if alive.

Franca paid them no mind and continued her descent.

Just as the "seaweed" was about to touch her, it unexpectedly burst into
black flames.

The black flames burned silently underwater, showing no signs of
extinguishing. The "seaweed" didn't turn to ash, but their consciousness
was snuffed out.

They floated in the water, swaying with the currents.

Farther away, a multitude of seaweed continued to surge forward,
obstructed by layers of condensed frost.

Beside the puddle, Lumian, engrossed in the Summoning Dance, did not
look at the monster. However, he heard a sound akin to a bubble popping.
A putrid odor wafted towards him, accompanied by an enveloping chill.

An image flashed across Lumian's mind:

The bloated monster with its enormous face was less than a step away
from him, almost clinging to his back. He could even perceive its
"breath"!

*Hiss...* Lumian instinctively gasped, refusing to interrupt the
Summoning Dance.

In the water, Franca, having dived deeper, finally sensed the presence
of the mirror!

Her form suddenly faded, vanishing from her original position.

Franca's figure swiftly materialized on the ancient silver mirror
resting silently on the seabed.

She retrieved the artifact and swam towards the surface, a look of joy
adorning her face.

She had just confirmed that this mirror truly led to the underground
tunnel in the outside world!

Beside the puddle, Lumian was filled with anxiety as he kept his gaze
fixed on the water's surface. The Summoning Dance was nearing its end,
and the bloated monster drew closer, its flesh almost brushing against
his skin.

If Franca did not emerge soon, he would resort to using Mr. K's finger!

Just then, Franca reached the shore, holding the mirror, and leapt up
amidst the splashing water.

Avoiding eye contact with the monster, she lowered her head and hurried
to Lumian's side, gripping his wrist.

Simultaneously, both of them turned ethereal, while the ancient mirror
clattered to the ground.

A scene unfolded upon the mirror's surface: Franca grasping Lumian's
hand and leading him through a short, dark tunnel to an illuminated
"cave" before leaping out.

Amidst flickering lights and shadows, Lumian realized he stood upon a
dim path, with distant light seeping in.

Franca retrieved the mirror that had served as his substitute and
noticed countless cracks marring its surface, on the verge of
shattering.

"That was a close call." She sighed sincerely.
