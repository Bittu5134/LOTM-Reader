## Chapter 622: Smell of Death

Under normal circumstances, dark-gray eyes wouldn't usually grab one's
attention. Such pupils were rare in Intis but not uncommon in places
like the Loen Kingdom. However, Franca sensed that there was crucial
information hidden within.

Moran Avigny was suspected to be a Mirror Person. The Demoness of Black
Clarice pursued the Mirror People, and being a demigod of the Demoness
pathway closely related to the Mirror World, they all shared those
unusual dark gray eyes.

Too much of a coincidence, isn't it?

"What's wrong?" Jenna asked with concern when Franca paused.

Franca deliberated for a few seconds before revealing that the Demoness
of Black shared the same eye color as Moran Avigny. Finally, she said,
"None of the Mirror People we encountered previously had such
characteristics."

"Only relatively special Mirror People have them? Is the Demoness of
Black also a Mirror Person?" Jenna guessed, her thoughts wandering.

"Impossible," Franca subconsciously denied. "She even tasked me with
investigating the Mirror People... Right, it's not impossible. Haven't
we read enough stories of burglars calling the police to catch thieves?"

Anthony thought for a moment and said, "Could it be a symbol of being
corrupted by the mirror's Primordial Demoness? Could special Mirror
People at a certain level have such eye color? Could it be the same for
a Demoness who has become a demigod and has been corrupted?

"No, Moran Avigny should have had dark gray eyes to begin with. It's
impossible for the Mirror People who replaced him to change the color of
his eyes without attracting suspicion," Franca pondered and deduced, "In
other words, does the Demoness of Black come from the same family as the
original Moran Avigny? I previously thought she belonged to the Sauron
family and was Browns Sauron's elder. Otherwise, she wouldn't have
nurtured such a simple-minded Demoness. Now, it doesn't seem so..."

"Not necessarily," Franca and Jenna said in unison.

Everyone had a paternal and maternal side of the family. Just because
they were from the Sauron family didn't mean they weren't from a
dark-gray-eyed family!

Franca hesitated for a few seconds before saying, "It's been a while
since I updated the Demoness of Black on the Mirror People
investigation. I plan to visit her this week and discuss Moran Avigny."

"Be careful," Jenna cautioned.

A gleaming smile played on Franca's lips as she replied, "Don't worry.
She tasked me with the Mirror People inquiry, so she should anticipate
some updates. If she has ties with Moran Avigny, we might see something
unfolding for the Minister of Industry shortly. If not, we can seek her
assistance!"

On Hanth Island, Lumian strolled through the dimly lit streets,
relishing the cool sea breeze that replaced the earlier heat as he
casually headed back to the Berries.

Hands tucked into his pockets, his mind raced with unusual activity. He
sifted through the legends and stories he had recently gathered,
attempting to uncover any hints about the elusive Demon.

Had Madam Magician not issued a cautious warning, and had Naboredisley
not disclosed the Demon descendant's name and identity, Lumian might
have considered using himself as bait. In such circumstances, he could
have showcased his malice, devised a plan with a chance of success,
triggering the Demon's Danger Premonition, luring it out to eliminate
the perceived threat. A concealed trap would await it.

*It's been a century or two. Numerous adventurers have ventured to
unravel the Demon legend. Despite the Church of Earth Mother's
relentless efforts to eradicate lingering issues, there's still no
resolution. Relying on conventional methods to track down that elusive
Demon seems impractical...*

*Looking at it from a different angle, why would the Demon choose to
remain on Hanth Island?*

*The Church of Earth Mother already purged it once. Why take the risk to
stay?*

*If it were me, I would have relocated ages ago. As a Demon, where
couldn't I survive?*

*If I truly believed I was a highly intelligent criminal---a genuine
Criminal---why use such a method to taunt the clergy of the Church of
Earth Mother? It would become dull after all these years...*

*Could there be a reason for its persistence on Hanth Island?*

*Is it perhaps partially sealed? Or is there something profoundly
significant buried on the island that cannot be moved?*

*The valley ablaze with sulfurous flames?*

*Moreover, Demons can live for centuries, but ordinary people cannot. If
the Demon indeed concealed itself in human towns, it would have to
change identities every few decades, potentially leaving
traces.*

*Hanth Island serves as a transit port for trade routes between the
Northern and Southern Continents. With numerous foreign settlers, the
Demon can effortlessly forge a new identity. However, how can it
smoothly exit the stage with its original identity?*

*The residents here all devoutly follow Earth Mother. Upon their demise,
they are invariably sent to the cathedral for a wake. Would a Demon have
the audacity to feign death and undergo Earth Mother's scrutiny and the
purifying touch of holy water?*

*Yes, vanishing is the optimal solution. Whether through a sea adventure
or disappearing into the forest, it effectively sidesteps corresponding
problems.*

*Every year, people vanish in the forest outside the city... Did the
Demon purposely orchestrate some accidents, concealing its 'death' among
them?* Lumian's thoughts raced as he gradually formulated
deductions and speculations.

This was also a tempering of a Conspirer's powers and a method to digest
the potion.

He had a vague understanding of the entire situation.

*If I want to locate the Demon concealed among humans, I must find the
mysterious valley ablaze with sulfur flames deep in the forest. To
unravel the valley's secret, I must rely on that Demon. These two
matters are likely intertwined and inseparable.*

Lumian had a tentative plan for tomorrow's investigation.

*I'll begin by exploring the forest, utilizing my Hunter powers to
search for the remains of the missing. If I discover one or two, and
they still retain some edible structure, I'll bring them back to Ludwig
and determine who the deceased last encountered.*

*Throughout this process, without alerting the clergy of the Church of
Earth Mother, I'll delve deeper into the island to identify any
anomalies. If they exist, what kind of anomalies they are...*

As he strolled leisurely, Lumian suddenly looked up and observed the
stars in the sky veiled by dark clouds.

In an instant, torrential rain poured down.

Drops of rain misted in front of Lumian. Without an umbrella, he had no
choice but to dash under the eaves of a three-story building on the
street and seek refuge outside a café with its lights off. He waited for
the storm to end impassively.

The few pedestrians on the road unfurled their umbrellas.

Lumian couldn't help but chuckle as he recalled the common depiction of
the Berserk Sea's islands in the travel guide: The weather is highly
erratic; remember to bring an umbrella or a hat when out.

Clearly, Lumian didn't take the reminder seriously.

He wasn't in a rush. Leaning against the café's two glass windows, he
quietly observed the raindrops streak down and the people returning home
late traverse different streets.

The sound of the rain masked all movement, and white mist veiled most of
his vision, creating the sensation for Lumian as if he were in another
world.

Observing this scene, Lumian reminisced about his wandering days.

Wanderers often struggled to predict the weather, making it challenging
to secure refuge in cathedrals and other places in advance.
Consequently, he would occasionally huddle in a corner of a street,
sheltered from the rain. He watched the rain with fear, worry,
uneasiness, and gloom, praying that no other vagabond would snatch his
temporary shelter.

But now, his mood was entirely different.

The heavy rain in the Berserk Sea ceased as swiftly as it had arrived.
In less than half an hour, only stagnant water remained on the street.

Lumian chuckled and tucked his hands back into his pockets. He strolled
along the wet street toward the harbor and boarded the Berries.

Just as Lumian pushed open the door and entered, he saw Lugano wiping
Ludwig's dripping hair with a dry and fluffy towel. Ludwig looked as if
he had taken an unexpected plunge.

"You didn't bring an umbrella?" Lumian asked with a smile.

Lugano replied awkwardly, "I thought I was a Planter and could predict
changes in the weather in advance, so I didn't bring an umbrella and led
Ludwig to the streets to buy supper. He said he didn't want to eat cakes
and biscuits tonight. Sigh, who knew that even though I predicted a
rainstorm, it only took tens of seconds before it arrived. At that time,
I wanted to carry Ludwig and rush back to the ship before the rain
started..."

Seeing that the Doctor didn't seek an objective reason and only
complained about his lack of ability, Lumian kindly added,

"This is the weather in the Berserk Sea. Even Planters can't predict
it."

This was also one of the reasons why the islands in the Berserk Sea,
clearly under the rule of the Church of Earth Mother, didn't always
experience bumper harvests like the Feynapotter Kingdom.

"Yes, yes, yes." Lugano heaved a sigh of relief.

Lumian turned to Ludwig, whose hair was now dry, and casually inquired,
"Do you smell anything?"

*Is there any particularly alluring "food" hidden nearby?*

Ludwig nibbled on a tortilla and responded, "There's the smell of
death."

*Smell of death?* Lumian frowned slightly.

"Did someone die near the night market?"

Ludwig shook his head.

"When it rains, there's the smell of death everywhere."

*What... what does this mean?* Lumian probed, voicing his
doubts.

Ludwig replied candidly, "I don't know. It disappeared later."

*It happens when it rains, but not after... Is this an abnormality from
the Berserk Sea, or is it the island's abnormality triggered by the
Berserk Sea's weather?* Lumian pondered for a moment, but he
wasn't in a rush to write to Madam Magician and inquire.

This was a digestion opportunity for him. He felt that he should avoid
relying on the power of a high-ranking person to digest it better unless
it was crucial.

That night, Lumian fell asleep with a heavy heart.

In his hazy dream, he saw many familiar and unfamiliar things.

The pale-white Samaritan Women's Spring, the mountain-sized Blood
Emperor's afterimage dripping with yellowish magma, and the unknown
object protruding from the spring...

The scene suddenly changed, revealing Lumian wandering alone in the deep
darkness underground.

It was as if he had become the Montsouris ghost.
