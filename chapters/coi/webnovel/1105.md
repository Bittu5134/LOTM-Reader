## Chapter 1105: Waiting

Facing Lumian's attack, Demoness of Gray Judith smiled serenely and
calmly.

The phantom tunnel where She was located collapsed on its own, and along
with Herself, before the Sword of Destruction could strike, fell piece
by piece like toppled building blocks, cascading like a waterfall.

Disaster preemptively engulfed Her, time and space storms swept through,
and only then came Lumian's black flame great sword.

By the time this area completely dissolved into nothingness, the
terrifying and indescribable time-space turbulence flowed chaotically in
the dark depths. In another phantom and dark tunnel, Demoness of Gray
Judith's figure strangely emerged.

She was clearly stalling Lumian, preventing him from returning to the
real world.

Lumian changed direction and took another step to arrive before the
Demoness of Gray, slashing out the Sword of Destruction.

†

Deep beneath the Tree of Shadow, the brown-green trunk of the Tree of
Shadow was completely shrouded in gray-white fog.

The mottled bark, settled desires, and ancient scenes gradually
presented a phantasmal texture under the erosion of fog of history.

The historical shall return to history!

Abstract things could become substantial, and could also be defined as
pure concepts.

The Lord of Mysteries could turn the true to false, and the false to
true, with the distinction between true and false no longer clear!

As the gray-white fog continuously eroded the Tree of Shadow, the figure
of Mr. Fool wearing black gloves, holding a star-studded staff, and
dressed in a deep black trench coat suddenly appeared with a flickering
sensation.

The star-studded staff lit up with brilliant radiance.

In a part of the mirror world, Mr. Fool took a step, quickly flickering
beyond what normal human eyes could capture.

Before him were multiple phantom tunnels that had been interrupted, with
all-consuming darkness flooding the collapsed area, blocking the path.

Mr. Fool spoke in a low voice, at an extremely rapid pace, "My, wish,
is:

"The, original, state, here, restored."

After each pronunciation, there was a pause, but this pause was not
obvious and did not affect the rapid delivery of speech, only making
some syllables seem to come from an extremely distant place.

As soon as the voice fell, a miracle occurred: those phantom and dark
tunnels became whole again, once more able to freely traverse.

†

Seeing the mirror tunnels in spider web formation successfully
repaired,Red Angel Medici, leaning against the edge of the mirror's rear
area, picked up the apple in His hand and took a smiling bite.

Medici, who had already condensed an iron-black blood-stained armor with
defense not much inferior to same-tier Warrior pathway Beyonders, did
not rush to move forward. Instead, He continued waiting at His original
location, awaiting potential subsequent mutations and possible
interlopers.

As a Hunter, one of the keys to success was patience---patiently waiting
for prey to enter the trap, waiting for all variables and accidents to
reveal themselves, finding the true weak point, and then delivering a
fatal strike to complete the harvest.

Last time, Medici had overlooked the possibility of Alista Tudor
actively choosing to be mad. This time, He would not exclude those
irrational choices.

†

Lumian, standing more than ten meters tall, was engulfed in deep red,
violet flames, yet his face retained a human form---one side brilliant,
the other handsome, with a blood-red, thorn-like mark at his forehead
threatening to burst forth.

The Demoness of Gray was about to employ Her usual trick and dodge the
enemy's frontal assault when Her mind suddenly trembled.

She instantly felt the opponent was tall, majestic, terrifying, strong,
and charismatic---involuntarily wanting to submit.

Even more horrifying was the sense of facing the source, facing a deity,
facing the embodiment of destruction and apocalypse.

This caused Her body and mind to briefly lose self-awareness, unable to
respond effectively in time.

Conquest!

Lumian had obtained the power of conquest through sacrificing to the
City of Calamity, supplemented with a hint of sefirah-quality conquest
power.

Now, he was a genuine City of Calamity priest, the high priest of war's
essence!

The Demoness of Gray froze in place. Lumian's iron-black eyes, revealing
pale regions, slashed down the black great sword burning with the Fire
of Destruction.

Simultaneously, the mirror world around the Demoness of Gray fractured
in all directions---up, down, left, right, front, and back. Each
fragment was "conquered" as a soldier, transforming into large and small
black flame-composed short arrows, restrained with violence and
destruction, swooshing toward Judith.

These densely packed, impenetrable arrows seemed to weave a net of
destruction, with Judith as the massive fish caught within.

*Boom!*

The Sword of Destruction cleaved into the Demoness of Gray's shoulder,
and the black flame short arrows hit the target from all directions.

Cracking sounds rang out continuously, and Demoness of Gray Judith's
Mirror Substitutions exploded simultaneously, without exception.

Now Her form in the mirror, but even Her form in the real world was
affected by Cull and the Sword of Destruction, suddenly erupting in
black flames and burning to ash.

Only those sleeping mirrors She had hidden in multiple places, having
severed most of Her mystical connections, were spared.

And She would need considerable time to resurrect through these means.

After dispatching the Demoness of Gray, Lumian's body suddenly shrank,
the blood-colored pennant between his brows gradually receding, yet
seeming to still writhe.

He made no delay, nor considered pursuing the Demoness of Gray,
immediately wanting to escape the mirror world and then find a way to
reunite with Franca, Jenna, and the others.

In an instant, he sensed something and cast his gaze toward one of the
illusory tunnels.

He felt true safety lay there.

Lumian's figure turned ethereal, about to traverse through.

Just then, his thoughts abruptly stiffened, and a slick yet marvelous
sensation spread across his surface.

He saw thick black hair like serpents emerging from nowhere, coiling
around him, their tips either embedded with black and white eyes or
bearing venomous snake heads, mouths slightly open, tongues protruding.

Lumian also saw that under the gaze of those black and white eyes, his
body had turned gray-white, transforming into stone, unable to use any
abilities.

He was layer upon layer wrapped by those thick, serpent-like, slick and
slightly damp black hairs in his stone state.

The only thing he could do now was commit suicide.

Suddenly, a gentle, soft female voice with a hint of laughter whispered
in his ear, "I have been waiting for you for a long time."

This voice scratched at Lumian's soul, making his entire body feel
itchy, and even petrified, he sank into it, not wanting to break free.

A name spontaneously flashed in his mind: *Primordial Demoness
Cheek!*

Two pure, delicate white hands stretched from behind and gently caressed
Lumian's cheeks.

These beautiful hands were not yet perfect, but they could evoke the
most primitive and intense desires of anyone who saw them, instantly
propelling them to heavenly pleasure from which they could never escape.

Just by being seen.

Lumian in his petrified state was equally affected, his mind almost
completely blank.

The reason it was not entirely blank was because he saw his mirror self
was also dragged out from hiding by those thick, slick black
serpent-like hairs, his body gray-white, because a curvaceous, icy yet
inexplicably fiery body was pressed against his back.

That body cradled his face, dragging him with black hair deeper into the
mirror world, rapidly retreating into that special mirror world.

Mr. Fool Blinked into this area, just in time to see Lumian being
embraced from behind by an infinitely charming, vaguely discernible
figure in the special mirror world, being dragged inside.

His black trench coat suddenly lifted.

Fooled!

Simultaneously, a dozen-meter-tall figure appeared before Lumian.

It was a female, wearing a dress seemingly made of white bones, her
black hair like venomous giant serpents---long, thick, and slick, with
snake heads at the tips or rolling black and white eyes, turning
everything around her to stone, releasing various mystical pathogens.

Her beauty of countenance had transcended human limits, reaching a
conceptual level. All living beings and all things would be infatuated
and entranced by Her slightest expression, perpetually in ecstasy. Even
rules and concepts seemed reluctant to constrain Her, to oppose Her.

Mr. Fool's Fooling instantly took effect, causing Her azure, ocean-like,
gem-crystal eyes to suddenly become clouded.

But Her charm did not diminish by half; instead, it presented a
different seduction.

This momentarily stunned Mr. Fool.

In that instant of stunned silence, the area outside the special mirror
world, along with the Primordial Demoness Cheek's figure, moved toward
apocalypse, instantly condensing into an exceptionally dangerous
darkness.

By the time Mr. Fool made his own wish and satisfied his own wish,
restoring the original scene, Lumian's figure had already disappeared
into the deep, dark region representing the special mirror world.

Mr. Fool's flickering figure raised the star-studded staff in his hand,
materializing a night sky full of brilliant stars before him.

Those stars quickly formed a directional, dreamlike key, forcibly
opening the barrier of the special mirror world, pinpointing Lumian's
current location.

Just as Mr. Fool was about to Wander in, a strange black surge suddenly
emerged at the edge of that deep darkness, forming an abnormally
massive, extremely distorted phantasm that resembled a human yet had
many non-human features.

This phantasm looked across the special mirror world's barrier, crazy
yet incredibly silent, watching Mr. Fool, as if waiting for him to come.

Mr. Fool stopped Wandering and similarly watched the phantasm in
silence.

In a mirror rear area not far from here, Red Angel Medici, leaning
against the hard mirror surface, brought the red apple in His hand to
His mouth and took another bite.

Within the crisp sound, He muttered softly, "Cheek indeed appeared.

"But She is not weak at all. In fact, She seems even stronger..."
