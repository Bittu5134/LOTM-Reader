## Chapter 839: The "Hidden" Taboo

*Other abnormalities?* Albus's first reaction was that Lumian
was imitating him, trying to trick him into looking at something he
shouldn't.

He cautiously scanned the wasteland below the corpse mountain, only
seeing undead soldiers fallen in different places and nearly
extinguished colorless embers.

During this process, Albus also listened for any movements around him,
but apart from the increasingly violent trembling and shaking of 0-01,
he received no other information.

"Are you trying to delay time this way? I think this is more
advantageous for me," Albus replied to Lumian with a smile.

The image of this competitor was reflected in his iron-black eyes as he
quickly estimated the probability of launching a successful surprise
attack in his mind.

He wanted to eliminate the last hidden danger before losing his close
combat ability.

Lumian didn't give Albus this opportunity. Although his arms had
weakened to the point where he could only pick up relatively light
objects, and his legs were so weak he could barely walk, the accumulated
spirituality he released was still quite abundant, enough to support him
in completing many teleportations.

His figure disappeared from Albus's sight, then reappeared on the side
of the corpse mountain.

Before Albus could find him, Lumian said with a smile, "It's
understandable that you didn't notice other abnormalities here. After
all, you don't seem to be someone who enjoys studying. And your
ancestor, that Red Angel, although having a very thorough understanding
of 0-01, the current 0-01 is no longer the same as before.

"From the Sealed Artifact information, I know that after your ancestor
was killed by the Blood Emperor, 0-01 changed hands twice---once to
Alista Tudor, and once to Death from the Southern Continent. Therefore,
it has been corrupted by other, equally high-level corruptions."

Seeing Albus's gaze turn towards him, seemingly listening and discerning
the truth of his words without immediate intention to launch an attack,
Lumian stayed in place and continued, "Of course, your ancestor visited
Fourth Epoch Trier and understood the various details of the
corresponding seal. Morora's seal was modeled after Trier's, so you
definitely wouldn't lack understanding of the situation here. But the
seals on both sides are only mostly similar, with many details still
having critical differences.

"The book 'Principles of Sealing' tells me that this is because 0-01 and
its corruption are purer compared to Fourth Epoch Trier; it's less
complex, can form fewer balances and constraints, and many
characteristic issues are more prominent.

"If your ancestor were to come in person, take a turn in the underground
mausoleum, no, just take a few glances, He would definitely understand
what abnormality I'm talking about. But unfortunately, He can't descend
to Morora, and probably can't see or hear directly through the seal
using your eyes and ears. He can only give you power, help you share the
damage, and listen to your reports periodically.

"Under these circumstances, heh heh, it's indeed understandable that you
didn't notice other abnormalities here."

Albus Medici stared down at Lumian, listening to his narrative with a
smile on his face, while pondering where the problem actually lay.

Rambling on and on about irrelevant things, it does seem like he's
trying to buy time.

*But buying time is more beneficial to me... The resonance between 0-01
and my ancestor is getting stronger and stronger. In two or three more
minutes, I'll be able to approach and drip some Medici family
blood...*

*His condition will only deteriorate faster than mine, the longer we
delay, the weaker he'll become...*

*Is he waiting for reinforcements? But unless the Archbishop of the
Church of Knowledge personally intervenes, there should be no one in
Morora who can participate in this struggle, and those outside Morora
can't come in... The Church of Knowledge currently appears quite
neutral, at most with a slight inclination in secret, they won't
directly get involved. Hehe, I need to be vigilant about this point,
so-called scholars are more treacherous than us Hunters, the more
knowledge they have, the more treacherous they become...*

*It's a pity, this trash can is very alert, he'll teleport away at the
slightest sign of trouble, while I need to get close to release the Fog
of War... No wonder my ancestor said that before Alista Tudor became a
god, he found Bethel Abraham more troublesome...*

*Continuously feinting attacks, forcing him to use teleport repeatedly,
draining his spirituality? That's one way. If we really go on according
to his pace, by the time his spirituality is insufficient to support
teleport, I'll also be almost unable to complete the battle, even
standing will be difficult, only able to rely on Fire Ravens---scatter
shots---like a blind man shooting birds...*

*But if feints are to be convincing, they need to consume a lot of
spirituality, and if they're not convincing, they can't bluff
anyone...*

*Why does this dog shit-like pathogen target the physical body first,
then affect the Spirit Body? If the rate of spirituality dissipation
could be as fast as the loss of muscle strength, the problem would be
simple. In that case, I wouldn't need to hold out for too long, just
longer than this trash can.*

As Albus's thoughts raced, Lumian smiled and said, "Do you need me to
give you a hint?

"I don't know if you've seen the sealing information for 0-01, but you
must be very familiar with the various taboos here. Haven't you noticed
that two sections of the content, or rather, two of the taboos, hide
problems?"

Two taboos hiding problems? Albus suddenly had a dangerous intuition, he
began to believe that some of what Lumian said might be true.

Lumian said with a mocking tone, "Haven't figured it out yet? See, this
is the consequence of not studying. I didn't notice it at first either,
but after reading a large amount of related books and materials in
Morora, I gradually developed doubts.

"Let me give you another hint. The first problematic taboo is that
experimental subjects must cover their eyes and carry a lamp, and if the
lamp goes out, that experimental personnel will directly disappear, and
everyone who knows him will simultaneously believe that he died long
ago."

"What's wrong with that? I've already had people verify the authenticity
of this taboo. Hehe, it's only because there are many light sources
here, otherwise we would have all disappeared by now," Albus quickly
thought about the details he might have overlooked.

At this moment, Lumian's figure suddenly disappeared.

He teleported to change his position, appearing near the top of the
corpse mountain, next to the Sword of Courage.

Taking advantage of the fact that he could still move the Traveler's
Bag, he crouched down and slipped the bag he had been holding in advance
over the Sword of Courage, returning it to its companions.

At this time, Albus, not expecting Lumian to appear so close to the top
of the corpse mountain, was still searching for the target with his gaze
across the wasteland.

By the time he reacted and condensed blue fireballs to bombard
downwards, Lumian had already activated the black mark on his right
shoulder and truly teleported to somewhere in the wasteland.

He risked picking up the Sword of Courage because he now realized that
he might be the one facing its indiscriminate attacks later.

As the rumbling explosions just began to subside, Lumian's voice sounded
again: "Haven't you figured it out yet?

"After I arrived at the real corpse mountain, I actually doubted my
guess and completely abandoned it, but the later results made me more
certain, and allowed me to figure out more problems along the way."

Lumian spoke to Albus Medici from afar in the tone of a teacher, "The
answer is, why must it be experimental subjects carrying lit lamps to
enter, why not place burning wall lamps at intervals inside the
underground mausoleum and replace the lamp oil regularly? Although this
would consume more resources, it would be more convenient and safer. The
Church of Knowledge's financial power couldn't possibly be unable to
support such an arrangement.

"Is it to make the seal seem mysterious and terrifying? Obviously not,
there are clearly deeper reasons."

Albus Medici's eyes flickered slightly, vaguely having some guesses.

He cast his gaze towards the embers scattered across the corpse
mountain.

Lumian's figure disappeared again, appearing among Celeste's corpse
fragments.

He then inverted the Traveler's Bag over the black teardrop-shaped
forehead ornament, collecting it.

This time, Albus tracked Lumian's figure in time, but he didn't make a
move, nor did he transform into a flame spear to throw himself over.

This was firstly because the other could teleport away at any time, and
secondly because what Lumian was doing now was also beneficial to him.

Albus was almost certain that the forehead ornament was the "source" of
the current mystical pathogen. After placing it in another space, the
concentration of pathogens here would gradually decrease, preventing
their conditions from rapidly deteriorating, allowing them to hold out
longer.

After putting away the forehead ornament, Lumian immediately teleported
to the wasteland on the other side of the corpse mountain, smiling at
Albus.

"The second problematic taboo is 'Beyonders with strength surpassing
Sequence 5 are forbidden from approaching. Warning, Beyonders with
strength surpassing Sequence 5 are forbidden from approaching.'"

Albus immediately understood Lumian's line of thought and asked in a
deep voice, "You mean there's no need to specifically emphasize that
Beyonders above Sequence 5 cannot approach?

"Indeed, in reality, as long as they're not already corrupted
experimental subjects or special people like us, whether they're above
Sequence 5 or not, they shouldn't approach 0-01."

Lumian wanted to applaud, but even adjusting the Traveler's Bag was
quite strenuous for him now.

He said with a tone that approved his educatability, "Yes, so why
specifically emphasize that Beyonders above Sequence 5 cannot approach?

"Probably because when Beyonders above Sequence 5 approach 0-01, besides
bringing danger to themselves, it would also trigger additional, more
terrifying abnormalities. Therefore, it must be specially warned!

"Just now, the appearance of Hand Bro brought about an attack from 0-01,
leaving embers all over this wasteland and corpse mountain. And from my
observation, these embers will extinguish on their own.

"What does this indicate? It indicates that before we came in, this
place was in darkness, without any firelight.

"Combining this with the first problematic taboo I mentioned, and with
what the book 'Principles of Sealing' says about self-balance and
self-sealing, the potential hidden danger becomes very clear."

Albus's expression changed slightly, obviously realizing what the
possible abnormality might be.

Lumian once again changed his position using teleportation and
continued, "That hidden danger is that there's a latent taboo:

"The underground mausoleum needs eternal, deathly darkness. It can
occasionally have light, but there can't be continuous light in the same
place. And when Beyonders above Sequence 5 with godhood approach, it
instinctively causes 0-01 to burn this area, bringing embers that can
last for a period of time."

At this point, Lumian's smile grew even brighter.

"Now, the embers have been burning for a while, and you're still
continuously creating firelight.

"I'm very curious about what will happen next."

*What will happen?* Albus Medici's gaze instantly froze, his
back suddenly tensing.

He knew where the problem lay now!

The frequency and amplitude of 0-01's trembling and shaking were more
violent than he had anticipated, progressing faster!

At this moment, the entire sky suddenly took on the color of burning.
