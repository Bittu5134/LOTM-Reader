## Chapter 330: Forewarned is Forearmed

A Fate Appropriator harbored two primary abilities:

Firstly, the capacity to magnify a corresponding fate tributary, thereby
setting in stone an imminent destiny for the target. This process could
be expeditious, yet its future influence spanned a mere ten seconds. The
resulting efficacy was contingent upon environmental compatibility; a
more congruent backdrop augmented the probability of the event
materializing in the forthcoming future.

Secondly, the ability to swap an accumulated fate for a fragment of the
target's own destiny. Absent a premeditated arrangement, one had to
either kill the adversary to access their fate or employ their personal
fate as a substitute. Relatively more protracted in execution than
magnifying an impending fate tributary, this method prohibited one from
assailing the target or inducing harm mid-process.

At this moment, Guillaume Bénet, who wasn't fighting one-on-one, clearly
didn't want to engage in a fate exchange. His plan was to utilize the
current environment and magnify Lumian Lee's female companion's fate
tributary of being affected by the Abyss Demon Flower's anesthetic gas
to make it a reality.

Of course, as the woman in the black hood hadn't fallen asleep and
wouldn't be paralyzed or knocked unconscious for ten seconds, the sole
recourse was to expedite the process while steering it toward the most
dire outcome.

In a similar vein, this elucidated one of the rationales behind
Guillaume Bénet's abstention from interfering with Lumian Lee's fate
tributary.

What he refrained from attempting was the exchange of the adversary's
fate or the inversion of key tributaries into the principal course, lest
he suffered the backlash invoked by Inevitability. He wouldn't have a
problem if he only made Lumian Lee slip and fall, achieving futures that
wouldn't have significant impact.

The mercurial river encircling Franca was reflected in Guillaume Bénet's
lightened eyes. After some discernment, he grabbed at one of the
tributaries formed by the mercury symbol that wrapped around itself.

Concurrently, Franca arched her neck, thereby unveiling her supple neck
and moist vermilion lips under the hood's shadows.

Peculiarly, a palpable flutter stirred in Guillaume Bénet's chest,
reverberating to his nether regions as he recollected scenes of his
liaisons with courtesans along Rue de la Muraille. Yet, these
recollections paled in allure compared to the figure opposite him,
despite her visage remaining partially veiled.

Despite his momentary lapse, Guillaume Bénet promptly reinstated his
focus.

Capitalizing upon this fleeting respite, Franca---enlightened to the
general scope of a Fate Appropriator's abilities courtesy of
Lumian---sparked latent black flames, engendering frost that enshrouded
her form.

Opaque filaments converged, manifesting palpable encasement amid the
frigid shroud, akin to a cocoon.

Unperturbed, Guillaume Bénet's lips curled into a smirk, unfazed by the
unfolding situation.

If a Fate Appropriator's abilities were so easily rendered ineffectual,
they wouldn't be called Fate Appropriators!

Furthermore, as long as the target's fate tributary was magnified or
underwent a fate exchange, they wouldn't be able to break free even if
they used a substitute.

With measured deliberation, Guillaume Bénet extended his right palm and
executed a slight wrist rotation, magnifying a particular fate he had
chosen.

Nonetheless, in this precise instant, he perceived the hooded lady's
fate river adopting an uncanny semblance of illusory ambiguity, an
etherealness so pronounced as to border on feigned fabrication.

*A decoy!*

Guillaume Bénet's endeavor to augment the fate tributary was abruptly
thwarted. The cocoon disintegrated, frost fragmenting and black flames
metamorphosing into coruscating beams of light.

Yet, the focus of the protection wasn't Franca herself, but rather, a
mirror!

Capitalizing on Guillaume Bénet's momentary bewilderment, a casualty of
the Demoness of Pleasure's allure and his self-imposed adverse effects,
Franca seized the initiative. Employing Mirror Substitution, she
ensconced herself in layers of black flames, frost, and spider silk,
confounding the adversary while concealing the real lethal peril.

Thus, she extricated herself from the figurative crosshairs, evading the
adversary's targeting.

Simultaneously with the failure of Guillaume Bénet's attempt to amplify
the fate tributary, a figure garbed in an Assassin's attire manifested
behind him, its visage partially obscured by a classic brass revolver,
aimed steadfastly at the enemy's cranium before pulling the trigger.

*Bang!*

The iron-black round collided with the dodging Guillaume Bénet's head,
emitting a distinct metallic clang.

Guillaume Bénet's head, bedecked in a metallic sheen, yielded to the
impact, though its structural integrity endured, deflecting a
potentially lethal strike.

Nearly in tandem, Lumian, having used Mirror Substitution to evade the
effects of Draynere Gland Poison, and draped in flaming clothes, emerged
nearby. Dropping to a genuflecting posture, he pressed his palms to the
ground.

In response, twin crimson fire serpents surged into being, consuming the
incendiary vines while spreading the flames along their trajectory,
ultimately converging to form a colossal pair of fire dragons.

Both entities surged toward Guillaume Bénet. However, their purpose
wasn't to ingest their quarry, but to intertwine and coalesce, giving
rise to an ostentatious and brilliant conflagration-blooming flower.

As the fiery flower unfurled before him, Guillaume Bénet grappled with
comprehending Lumian Lee's intentions.

With his Steel Body, his resistance to flames was steadfast for the time
being, but the other party wouldn't go as far as wasting an opportunity
and do nothing but perform fire magic, right?

This was Bribe!

Lumian had "gifted" Guillaume Bénet with a blazing flower---an emblem
signifying incineration and obliteration. Capitalizing on the Decency
brooch, he had completed a Bribe, thereby attenuating the adversary's
defenses.

Although Lumian Lee's true motives remained opaque, Guillaume Bénet's
intuition kindled with the conviction that this augured unfavorably.

In rapid succession, Guillaume Bénet invoked Light Incarnation anew,
fragmenting into three iterations as he advanced toward Lumian. As
Franca's assault faltered, she vanished anew.

Witnessing the three iterations of the metalized Guillaume Bénet rapidly
engorge, Lumian conjured a new cohort of Fire Ravens and distributed
them evenly amongst the trio of adversaries.

Then, turning his form and slowing his pace, he primed himself for a
prospective evasion of the ensuing Water Cannon conjured from Draynere
Gland Poison.

*Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!* The crimson Fire Ravens landed
precisely on the three metalized Guillaume Bénets.

*Rumble, rumble, rumble!*

They exploded simultaneously!

A torrent of dark-green liquid surged forth from one of Guillaume
Bénet's forms---Water Cannon. Lumian, braced for the assault, deftly
evaded, his gaze fixed upon the collision of aqueous impact against the
rocky wall, a tremor rippling through the Bottle of Fiction.

Yet, as Lumian's evasion completed, he detected a colossal shadow
enshrouding his feet. Thereupon, a medley of pallid-white and
obsidian-black arms extended forth from this obscurity.

In contrast, Lumian's other choice of direction was shrouded in a dark
shadow.

At Sequence 5, Light Incarnation permitted Guillaume Bénet the creation
of up to three incarnations, each incarnation fake. One harbored
Draynere Gland Poison, while the other pair wielded Shadow Burial,
intent on ensnaring Lumian within their shade-infused grasp.

Curved, grotesque limbs ensnared Lumian's ankles, striving to haul him
into the nebulous depths.

Amid this peril, a figure emerged from the inky depths---a half-naked,
metallic-finished Guillaume Bénet.

Shadow Burial was a form of shadow concealment for him!

By capitalizing on three Light Incarnations---which consumed a large
amount of spirituality---to veil his position, thereby detaining Lumian
temporarily, Guillaume Bénet engineered his stealthy approach via the
shadows, orchestrating a decisive assault.

His body suddenly expanded as he punched Lumian behind the ear.

A thunderous crack resonated as Lumian's form fragmented akin to a glass
pane, fracturing into myriad minuscule fragments subsequently claimed by
the pallid-white and obsidian-black arms.

Mirror Substitution!

It was precisely due to the implementation of Mirror Substitution that
Franca refrained from intervening on Lumian's behalf when she saw him
restrained by the strange arms extending from the shadow. Rather, she
bided her time, anticipating Guillaume Bénet's advent to administer a
terminal blow.

Amidst the cracking sounds, Franca's hooded, black-robed figure
involuntarily appeared once more, quickly spotted by the padre.

Guillaume Bénet had been waiting for this opportunity to stop himself
from being affected by the charm and turn his blue eyes light-colored
again.

He saw the mercurial river of fate and began to choose the fate of being
paralyzed by the burning gasses of the Abyss Demon Flowers.

Yet, an abrupt surge of peril seized Guillaume Bénet's consciousness,
compelling a stark realization: interference with the adversary's fate
would undoubtedly yield cataclysmic repercussions.

*Impossible! Moments earlier, such consequences hadn't arisen!*
Yet, as he scrutinized the figure before him, Guillaume Bénet, who had
been able to interfere with his target's fate normally previously to
near success, saw a hooded woman hiding behind the hooded woman. The
woman behind her held a palm-sized mirror that illuminated his figure.

In an instant, Guillaume Bénet understood what was going on.

The hooded woman standing in front of him, revealing the river of fate,
was Lumian Lee!

After activating Mirror Substitution, he took the initiative to appear
in front of his companion. Seizing the opportunity, he used a
Transfiguration-like ability to change his appearance and disguise
himself as his companion!

*You do realize, using the same trick won't work twice?* Franca,
who was hiding behind Lumian, chuckled when she saw this.

Seeing Lumian under attack, she took out her teammate's Mirror
Substitution and threw it in front of her. Taking advantage of the cover
and the enemy's drawn attention, she aimed another mirror at Guillaume
Bénet.

Without hesitation, Franca's palm was enveloped in black flames as she
swiped the mirror's surface.

Curse!

Demoness's Curse!

In a simultaneous eruption, a quietly smoldering black flame ignited
from within Guillaume Bénet's metallic form.

Elated that his Steel Body rendered him impervious to conflagration,
inflicting only minor wounds, he soon perceived an anomalous drain on
his spirit, coupled with indications of severe ethereal scorching.

In the span of an eye's flutter, the Cordu village padre emitted a
tormented cry.

Instantaneously, his metallic semblance plummeted to the earth with a
cacophonous clatter, reconstituting into a form unadorned by metal,
starkly naked and manifestly fleshy.

At the same time, Franca, too, experienced a visceral tremor, her
countenance assuming a pallid hue.

"Rebirth!"

The contract ability in question facilitated Guillaume Bénet's revival
within the slayer's body!

Guillaume Bénet's spirit smiled and hastened to replace the woman
holding the mirror and take control of her body.

Yet, he confronted a disconcerting reality: before him stood an
enshrouded woman brandishing a mirror, baring her lower visage in a
manner reminiscent of malevolent allure.

*She's in front... Then whose body did I Rebirth into?* A
disorienting befuddlement inundated Guillaume Bénet.

Meanwhile, Lumian, ensconced within Franca's semblance, donned a knowing
grin, gradually retracting his right palm from the padre's lifeless
cadaver, the Decency brooch aglow with a dusky-golden luminescence.

Distortion!

How could he not guard against Guillaume Bénet's Rebirth ability when he
already knew that Guillaume Bénet's mistress had chosen such an ability?

Lumian couldn't overtly commandeer Guillaume Bénet's Rebirth with his
seal and corruption alone. Nevertheless, Lumian, resembling Franca with
uncanny precision, had already instructed Franca to bring the Earth
Blood ore.

Innately repellent to even the Montsouris ghost, the Earth Blood ore
imposed an unseen force field compelling Guillaume Bénet's Spirit Body's
circumvention.

Leveraging the Distortion afforded by the Decency brooch, coupled with
the Earth Blood ore's obstructive efficacy and the Niese Face's
transformation, Lumian orchestrated Guillaume Bénet's Rebirth within his
very body!

Although Lumian's visage paled and his frame quivered slightly, a smile
graced his lips as he extended his hand towards his left chest, gently
declaring, "Padre, everyone is waiting for you."
