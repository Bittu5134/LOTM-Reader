## Chapter 475: Conspirer

Recognizing the black-cloaked man as the late General Philip, a surge of
realization struck Lumian's mind, cutting through the darkness.

He connected various dots and reevaluated details he had previously
deemed a stretch.

Earlier, Lumian had queried Gardner Martin about his support for Hugues
Artois, the spokesperson of numerous evil gods. Martin asserted that he
was well aware of Artois's nature and the sinister forces backing him.
Martin endorsed Artois for parliament with the belief that he would
repeatedly bring calamity to the market district, compelling citizens
and workers to rally behind the Iron and Blood Cross Order, preparing
for a future government overthrow.

Until today, Lumian had accepted this reasoning on the surface. Even if
Martin hadn't disclosed the complete truth, he had unveiled a fraction
of it. However, now it appeared that 90% of Martin's statement was a
fabrication!

Hugues Artois had been groomed by the late General Philip and thrust
into politics. Gardner Martin had clearly established a cooperative
relationship with General Philip long ago. His backing of Hugues Artois
wasn't merely an opportunistic exploit; rather, he had been intricately
involved in the plan from the outset!

Similarly, General Philip, having feigned his death and diverged from
his intended fate, utilized the Dreamseekers charity organization to
finance Painters and other evil god-bestowed. Simultaneously, he joined
the Carbonari, fomenting riots and rebellions. Lumian found this not
entirely surprising, but the connection with Gardner Martin and the Iron
and Blood Cross Order added an intriguing layer to the details.

By the time the Hostel ritual officially commenced, Lumian had already
grasped the essence of this conspiracy. Yet, some explanations seemed a
bit forced. For instance, how had Meyer Maipú, having left the Bliss
Society in frustration and returned to the market district to prove
himself, managed to contact the Painters or the evil gods' bestowed
planning the Hostel ritual?

One plausible explanation was that Susanna---while still the high
priestess of the Bliss Society---had established connections with other
cults before her demise. As Maipú Meyer's lover and a crucial member of
the Bliss Society, he should have had some contacts. However, upon
closer scrutiny, it felt a tad contrived. Did Maipú Meyer truly maintain
good relationships with believers of other evil gods? Would he naturally
seek their aid when confronting challenges to prove himself?

Despite Maipú Meyer's knowledge of an Angel sealed within Lumian's body,
he couldn't fathom exploiting this information beyond offering
sacrifices. Unless the Mother Tree of Desire bestowed a revelation
directly, why wouldn't the Recipient, potentially having received a
divine revelation, flaunt it? Why face ostracism from other Bliss
Society members?

Lumian found that all the details made more sense now that Gardner
Martin and his connection to General Philip were revealed as part of the
conspiracy.

Following the Tree of Shadow disaster, Gardner Martin tasked Lumian,
Franca, and their subordinates in the market district with investigating
the incident and Hugues Artois's assassination. However, he would
undoubtedly gather information about the Bliss Society's actions,
mistakes, and issues through General Philip.

In these circumstances, Maipú Meyer, seeking a return to the market
district, naturally established a connection with General Philip, who
had shown interest in such matters, and provided crucial information.
Consequently, Gardner Martin had long been aware of what was sealed
within Lumian.

The entire Hostel ritual might have been conceived by him, General
Philip, and the Painters.

One of them harbored a longstanding desire for Fourth Epoch Trier and
possessed extensive knowledge of secrets and mysticism. They understood
the seal's operation and its past leaks. Salle de Bal Brise, owned by
the Savoie Mob, and 13 Avenue du Marché served as a testing ground for
the Iron and Blood Cross Order's new members.

The other had a deep connection to the domain of fate. Through the
financial support of the Dreamseekers charity organization, he had
united many cults, accumulating vast knowledge in various aspects.

The reason why Hugues Artois had numerous evil gods' bestowed protecting
him wasn't merely due to his ability to interact with problematic
individuals or the deeply ingrained "enlightened" perception he had on
others. Instead, it was because his backer, General Philip, a veteran of
large-scale wars, had long been dedicated to cooperating with heretics
to achieve a crucial goal.

Lumian suspected that Gardner Martin hadn't officially tested him and
allowed him to join the Iron and Blood Cross Order out of initial trust.
Instead, he had finalized the Hostel plan and decided to keep Lumian
under close watch, exerting various influences and manipulating him.

If the Tarot Club hadn't intervened and the ritual hadn't been hastily
advanced, it was highly likely that Gardner Martin or a demigod of the
Iron and Blood Cross Order would have been the one to ultimately
confront Lumian and transport him into the painting world to activate
the ritual!

As these thoughts raced through his mind, Lumian's understanding became
clear.

Everything Gardner Martin had undertaken since the Tree of Shadow
disaster was geared towards the Hostel ritual!

*As expected of a former or current Conspirer...* Lumian sighed
sincerely.

Certainly, Gardner Martin might not have been aware of the residual aura
of Blood Emperor Alista Tudor that Lumian carried, but he likely
harbored suspicions. However, he couldn't fathom the core issue. After
all, he was aware that an Angel was sealed within Lumian Lee's body, a
walking anomaly bound to attract attention.

Regarding whether Gardner Martin knew about another organization backing
him and Franca, Lumian believed that Martin had sensed something awry,
but the precise details remained elusive. Even Maipú Meyer, not present
at the Tree of Shadow ritual, was unaware of the events during that
time.

Lumian signaled Jenna to cease the mirror magic to evade detection by
Gardner Martin and General Philip. Meanwhile, he pondered.

*Why does the Iron and Blood Cross Order covet Fourth Epoch Trier so
intensely, going to such lengths in preparation? What is their ultimate
goal?*

*If I hadn't arrived in Trier, stayed at Auberge du Coq Doré, and
attracted the Fallen Tree Spirit Susanna Mattise, what would have been
the original plan of the Iron and Blood Cross Order and the various
cults? How did they intend to bypass the seal and unlock the door to
Fourth Epoch Trier?*

As the latter question surfaced, Lumian recalled something.

Gardner Martin had once directed "Rat" Christo's smuggling caravan to
transport an item into Trier through an underground tunnel. This item
activated the special mirror world hidden underground. Later, Franca
sensed that item while tracking the black-cloaked Carbonari member,
General Philip, who had faked his death...

Now, General Philip had also entered this place, suspected to be Fourth
Epoch Trier!

*They had made extensive preparations, including orchestrating a massive
riot. Their goal was to use that item and its connection to the mirror
fragments in the wilderness to infiltrate this place through the seal
leak that once appeared beneath Salle de Bal Brise. Later, they had a
better choice---me...*

*Dammit! Gardner Martin's words about why he supported Hugues Artois's
election as a member of parliament were mostly true! He did need such a
person to incite public anger in the market district, not to overthrow
the government, but to satisfy the ritual!*

*Heh heh, pushing villains into power while posing as the leader of the
resistance. He's both the antagonist and the protagonist. He's truly
extracting the value from all the people in the market district
dry...* Lumian reacquainted himself with the Sequence name
"Conspirer" through Gardner Martin.

At that moment, Jenna grasped Lumian's meaning and discontinued the
mirror magic.

Gardner Martin smiled and said, "It's indeed you, Philip. Let's enter
Fourth Epoch Trier."

*Philip...* Jenna, who had only a vague impression of General
Philip's photo from the shadows, now realized that the cloaked man
Franca had been trailing was General Philip, the one who had faked his
death.

Philip's deep, mellow voice resounded.

"Aren't you going to find Lumian Lee? If he becomes your loyal
subordinate and joins your team, you can immediately complete the
ritual, consume the potion, and advance to a demigod."

Gardner Martin sighed and responded, "I find it a pity too. An Angel is
sealed within him, and he alone is a team. I've given him many chances,
but he never understood what loyalty meant. Now, I have an alternative.
Let him perish naturally in Fourth Epoch Trier."

*An Angel sealed within him?* Jenna's eyes widened as she looked
at Lumian.

Lumian smirked and scoffed at Gardner Martin's words.

*I'd be a fool to believe you!*

*The person scheming to use me from the start talking about loyalty and
pity?*

Just as Gardner Martin and General Philip turned around to walk toward
the magnificent city, two figures emerged from a mirror fragment in the
nearby wilderness.

It was Franca, dressed in a blouse, beige white breeches, a small dark
brown coat, and black leather boots, along with Anthony Reid, clad in
military green.

Franca scanned the surroundings and spotted Gardner Martin, encased in
full-body silver armor with his visor raised.

Anthony Reid's gaze locked onto General Philip's face, featuring a
prominent bulge on his nose.

The eight eyes met, and the air momentarily froze.

†

Count Poufer's figure materialized at the edge of the wilderness, in
front of the pale-black stone bricks.

Gazing at the giant shrouded in storms, lightning, flames, and smoke,
standing dozens of meters tall, he sprinted over with the fanatical
expression of a sacrificial lamb.

It was Vermonda Sauron, who had lost control and gone underground.

The former Archangel, the Conqueror, who was very close to a deity's
throne!
