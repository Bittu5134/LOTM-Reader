## Chapter 1095: Convergence?

After confirming the dark gold coin was indeed a Tudor coin with a "2"
denomination, Franca inwardly cursed the Blood Emperor's persecution of
those with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

*Why such a significant difference in patterns when it's just a
different denomination?*

*They're essentially expressing almost the same symbolic
meaning!*

Niceea, unaware of her superior's peculiarity, continued to describe the
origins of the two items, "This brooch is a Gustav family item, made
according to their family crest. It's one of Louis Gustav's most valued
possessions and a symbol of his identity.

"Normally, he carries this brooch with him, but this time he left it in
his original hideout.

"This ancient gold coin and the brooch were kept together and seem
equally important."

Under the pull of invisible spider silk, the brooch formed by
intertwined snakes flew towards Franca.

Franca was not unfamiliar with the Gustav family crest. After a quick
glance, she confirmed its authenticity and chuckled inwardly.

*A DNA double helix structure, right?*

Clearly, the current Gustav family crest originated from a "masterpiece"
during the late period of Emperor Roselle, not from earlier ancestors.

Niceea looked up at her beautiful, elegant, and natural superior,
pleading, "Madame, after you complete the Magic Mirror Divination, can
you return these two items to me?

"I stole them from Grouès. If I don't return them promptly, I'll
definitely be suspected."

"No problem." Franca's mirror projection took the brooch and coin,
retracting into the makeup mirror.

Niceea patiently waited in the current room.

†

"Louis Gustav's mysterious disappearance is related to the Tudor coin."
After taking the Gustav family brooch and Tudor coin out of the mirror,
Franca conveyed this information to Lumian, who was presumably still
asleep, through the mental-linked team communication channel.

A few seconds later, Lumian opened his bedroom door and walked into
Franca's room.

Everyone residing in this luxurious villa was a demigod, possessing
strong spiritual intuition. They noticed the commotion and threw on
outer garments, heading to Franca's room.

The only one who didn't react was Ludwig, who was preparing his second
midnight snack in the annex kitchen.

After Franca briefly explained Niceea's feedback, she spoke with
considerable gravity, "I plan to first pray to Mr. Fool, then perform
Magic Mirror Divination to see if I can determine Louis Gustav's current
whereabouts using these two items as a medium."

"I'll do it." Lumian reached out and took the brooch and coin, "I'll
first seek Mr. Fool's consent, then use him as the subject for Magic
Mirror Divination. This will help eliminate most interference and
danger."

"That's best," Jenna agreed with Lumian's choice.

Lumian pressed his hand to his chest and began praying, communicating
his request to Mr. Fool.

After receiving consent, he immediately took out a mirror and placed the
Gustav family brooch and Tudor coin on the glass surface.

Then, he gently caressed the mirror's surface, reciting the spell in
Hermes, "The Fool that doesn't belong to this era,

"The mysterious ruler above the gray fog,

"The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck..."

Lumian recited the entire spell at a steady pace, posed the question
about "Louis Gustav's current whereabouts", and patiently waited for Mr.
Fool's guidance.

Within seconds, the mirror's surface rippled, revealing a figure.

The figure was tall, mimicking Emperor Roselle with chestnut-colored
long hair, sporting two beautiful mustaches, azure eyes, and thin
lips---the leader of the Emperor Party, Louis Gustav.

This man, claimed to have Gustav family bloodline, stood in what seemed
to be an abandoned mine, walking towards a darkness-shrouded exit.

The image suddenly blurred, with Louis Gustav instantly enveloped by
darkness, surrounded by shadowy figures hidden in the depths, casting
observant gazes.

Louis Gustav walked forward without averting his eyes or stopping,
completely indifferent to the gazes from the darkness.

The deeper he walked, the more profound the darkness became.

Later, a slight light appeared on the forward side, and the image became
extremely blurry.

Louis Gustav did not approach the light, continuing to move straight
ahead.

After an indeterminate time, a door composed of pure light appeared in
the distance, resembling an oval mirror.

Louis Gustav approached the door of light and extended his right hand,
pressing against it.

He penetrated the door of light, arriving in an area with dense
fog---visibility under ten meters---with surrounding collapsed buildings
either asymmetrical or stained with blood.

*This is... Fourth Epoch Trier!* Lumian, Franca, Jenna, and
Anton had all been to Fourth Epoch Trier and were familiar with such
scenes.

The only difference they noticed was the excessively dense fog, which
felt extremely oppressive.

"Is this the depths of Fourth Epoch Trier? Is the Blood Emperor's divine
corpse affecting this place, bringing widespread Fog of War?" Lumian
quickly speculated.

Franca recalled, "But when we were there, we could see the collapsed
palace with the Blood Emperor's divine corpse, and the fog wasn't this
dense..."

"Did something change in Fourth Epoch Trier after the Hostel incident?
Or is this triggered by Louis Gustav's approach?" Jenna proposed
possible explanations.

At that moment, Louis Gustav in the mirror stopped.

Before him, less than ten meters away, a human shadow was cast on the
blood-splattered street stones.

The black shadow was stretched long by the light, seemingly cradling an
infant.

Almost simultaneously, the image suddenly collapsed, rippling like
water, with Mr. Fool's guidance ending.

Lumian furrowed his brow, muttering to himself, "Madame Pualis and the
infant Omebella?

"Are they in Fourth Epoch Trier?

"Did Louis Gustav enter Fourth Epoch Trier to meet them?

"Did Louis Gustav enter Fourth Epoch Trier through the special mirror
world? Were the Mirror People covertly watching him? Is the slightly lit
area he didn't approach hiding a great terror of the special mirror
world?"

No one could answer Lumian's questions.

After a few seconds, Jenna organized her thoughts. "We cannot handle
this matter.

"Since it potentially involves Madame Pualis and infant Omebella, we
must strictly follow Mr. Fool's guidance: calamity needs to keep away
from the Mother."

"Hmm, I'll report the conclusion to the Demoness of Black and let them
investigate. No matter how much she urges me, I won't budge, I'll just
say I'm not capable!" Franca mumbled, "And I'll notify 007 too. Such a
matter is best handled by official Beyonders. They hold many secrets of
Fourth Epoch Trier and might be able to send strong individuals to enter
there without using the special mirror world, eliminating Louis Gustav,
Madame Pualis, and infant Omebella."

Lumian nodded. "Okay."

He then reminded Franca, "The operation to eliminate targets in Fourth
Epoch Trier should not be led by Eternal Blazing Sun Church Beyonders.
Have you forgotten? The mystical father of infant Omebella is the
Eternal Blazing Sun."

"How could we possibly forget something like that?" Franca signaled
Lumian and the others to leave her bedroom.

Then she took out a mirror, "sending" the results of the Magic Mirror
Divination along with the brooch and coin to the mirror corresponding to
the Demoness of Black, and reminded her to return the mediums, otherwise
Niceea would be in trouble.

Shortly after, the Demoness of Black responded to Franca, "If Louis
Gustav returns, inform me immediately."

Accompanying the response were the brooch and coin, which flew out of
the mirror surface by themselves.

Not letting me investigate deeply, just waiting for Louis Gustav's
return? How strange. Isn't this unrelated to the Demoness Sect? Is this
not their trap? Franca was puzzled, and again projected herself through
the mirror world to Niceea's room.

She relayed the Demoness of Black's words to Niceea and returned the
Gustav family brooch and Tudor coin.

Niceea quietly sighed in relief.

She then had the mood for casual conversation. "Madame, I visited the
Lavigny Docks recently and found that the Church of The Fool there now
has a patron saint named Franca Roland.

"Her name is the same as yours."

Niceea originally didn't think this was related to her superior.
Throughout Trier, there were hundreds of women named Franca. But the
patron saint's honorific title included "the Demoness Accompanied by
Strife and Catastrophe."

Franca was slightly embarrassed, not because her subordinate knew the
honorific title, but because her "side job" in another organization was
discovered.

She responded with an air of profundity, "In this world, everyone has
multiple identities for certain purposes."

In other words, neither denying nor confirming.

Niceea didn't dare ask further, seriously considering whether she should
openly convert to Mr. Fool to get closer to her superior.

Privately, everyone was still the Primordial One's children.

After Franca's mirror projection disappeared, Niceea packed away the
makeup mirror, brooch, and coin, merged into the darkness, and silently
returned to the master bedroom.

She didn't rush to lie back in bed, first placing the brooch and coin in
a hidden compartment of the desk.

After completing this task, she glided back to the bed like a shadow in
the night, lying down without making a sound, pulling the blanket over
herself.

Suddenly, a low voice sounded near her ear.

"Where did you just go?"

Niceea instinctively turned her head, seeing Grouès, who had been
soundly asleep, now had his eyes open, his blue eyes deeply and darkly
fixed on her.
