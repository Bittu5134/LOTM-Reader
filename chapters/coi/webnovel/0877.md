## Chapter 877: Promised Matters

Amon began reading again in a flat tone, "When the anomaly at Cordu
Village was discovered, the corruption and personality distortion in
Aurore Lee had already become quite severe. If the most skilled
Psychologist provided treatment and any true god offered a seal, it
might have been possible to save her. But why save her?

"If the situation at Cordu Village had continued to develop, it would
indeed have caused a significant catastrophe. However, if intervened, it
could bring substantial benefits and play an important role at a
critical moment in the future.

"The lizard-shaped elves entered Cordu Village, quietly maintaining the
balance. They wanted the outcome to follow the heretics' original plan
but not actually succeed. At the same time, they ensured that Aurore Lee
retained a slight chance of resurrection.

"In the end, their goal was achieved. Before the Sinners' organization
sent someone, Guillaume Bénet conducted the grand sacrifice himself,
opening a temporary passage above the barrier, allowing Termiboros to
descend.

"Amon had already been waiting nearby, deceiving the ritual, utilizing
the barrier, and secretly following Termiboros back into this world.

"Aurore Lee pushing Lumian Lee away in the end brought a bit of an
unexpected twist, but it did not change the overall outcome. The Fool's
aura on Lumian Lee, stimulated by the surrounding environment and his
intense emotional fluctuations, successfully attracted The Fool's
attention..."

Hearing this, Lumian's hands unconsciously clenched into fists, his
heart burning with rage, overpowering the numbness and despair.

Amon, as if not noticing his emotional change, continued to read, "As a
result, Termiboros was severely wounded, and together with the soul
fragments of Aurore Lee and the villagers of Cordu, was sealed into
Lumian Lee's body. During this process, Amon voluntarily joined them,
stealing Termiboros' fate and identity before He could recover, killing
Him and reducing Him to a Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristic of the
Inevitability pathway.

"Before Lumian Lee became an Ascetic, Amon had already absorbed the
Beyonder characteristic, completing the pathway switch, fully replacing
Termiboros, only lacking the final ritual.

"This is very important. Whether it's the vortex ritual now or another
plan, it doesn't change. Lumian Lee will understand why soon."

At this point, Amon looked up at the dark sky covered with a thick
glass-like layer, smiled, and said, "Next, I will only read the key
parts, otherwise, I'm afraid Roselle won't last that long."

Lumian didn't respond to Him, using all his strength to suppress his
emotions.

He wanted to uncover the truth behind many previous events!

Amon lowered His head again, looking at the paper in His hand. "After
the first phase of psychological treatment ended, the hidden dangers of
the Tree of Shadow were prematurely triggered, forcing Lumian Lee to
face Susanna Mattise's sacrifice.

"The Amon sealed within him indeed couldn't bear the weight and
complexity of the Tree of Shadow's fate torrent, nor could He rapidly
evolve the fate fragments of encountering the Montsouris ghost into an
attack by the Montsouris ghost. However, the Angel of Fate, Ouroboros,
had always been watching from nearby. This was His specialty, and in
this regard, He was far superior to the Sufferer of the Inevitability
pathway.

"With Ouroboros's covert assistance, Lumian Lee successfully swapped the
fate of being attacked by the Montsouris ghost with the fate of the Tree
of Shadow having its roots burned by the Fourth Epoch Trier's invisible
flames. This would play a crucial role in Lumian Lee and Susanna
Mattise's upcoming battle.

"Between the two battles, Amon didn't miss the opportunity, deliberately
describing Lumian as the unfortunate one to strike at him. This was a
deception; if it were the real Termiboros, He would have said similar
words in such a situation.

"At the end of the Tree of Shadow incident, the lizard-like elf
deliberately let Lumian Lee see it, giving him a strong desire and
motivation to continue exploring the truth behind the Cordu disaster."

Hearing this, Lumian was stunned again.

*My desire, my anger, is that what that individual wanted too?*

Amon seemed to skip parts and started reading the next key point,

"The madman Flameng, driven insane by encountering the Montsouris ghost,
coincidentally stayed at the Auberge du Coq Doré. His experiences and
ending resonated with Lumian Lee. The Earth Blood stone he left behind
gave Lumian Lee the chance to obtain the residual aura of the Blood
Emperor.

"At this time, due to the convergence of Amon's main body, more and more
Amons noticed Lumian Lee's existence and obtained corresponding
information.

"To bring out the hidden value of the Earth Blood stone, one of the
Amons chose to steal it. Coincidentally, a lady from the Church of
Evernight asked Lumian Lee for help to obtain water from the Samaritan
Women's Spring leading them into the underground catacombs.

"With the enthusiastic help of the Amons, Lumian Lee ultimately used the
Earth Blood stone to gain the residual aura of the Blood Emperor. This
was the first step in his mystical similarity to 0-01 which could
provide him help in critical moments.

†

"The Hostel plan was initiated as expected. Some participants were
killed, some achieved their goals, and those outside who could not
observe Fourth Epoch Trier received guidance, while Lumian Lee and
others obtained a fragment of the special mirror world for the first
time.

†

"After leaving Trier, Lumian Lee inevitably converged to Port Santa,
where the seal was reinforced early. Though it left hidden dangers, it
could at least last longer...

"On the subsequent journey, Lumian Lee encountered Father Montserrat and
obtained Omebella's burned umbilical cord. He also got involved in
matters related to Naboredisley, laying the foundation for meeting
Farbauti's avatar in the tomb at the end of the Dream Festival...

"During the Dream Festival, Lumian Lee successfully obtained the seal of
the Underworld Daoist, truly gaining mystical similarity to 0-01...

"During the journey, Lumian Lee also met several people with experiences
similar to his but with different choices and outcomes, which touched
him, firming his ideas, and further improving his psychological state.
The second phase of psychological treatment was successfully completed.

†

"After asking Mr. K for help to solve Perle's painting person, Lumian
Lee went to the first cathedral built by the Aurora Order for the True
Creator. There, he coincidentally saw the lizard-like elves crawling in
and out of the god.

"This dealt him a huge blow, worsening his psychological state, but also
made his desire and determination for revenge stronger and firmer.

†

"After returning to Trier from Morora, Lumian Lee began preparing for
his advancement to Iron-blooded Knight. What he didn't realize was that
his psychological state and emotional condition had not met the
requirements to become a demigod. Even with the sealed angel as a
teammate, there was a significant probability that he would lose control
after consuming the Iron-blooded Knight potion.

"Fortunately, the presence of the Black Tear and Celia Bello becoming a
Demoness of Pleasure prematurely triggered the emotional issues within
Lumian's team. After much entanglement and pain, Lumian chose to face
his thoughts and tried to respond to others' attention to him. Although
his response was twisted, he at least took the first step, no longer
passively accepting but placing himself in a position of importance.
This mindset change was crucial for his subsequent advancement ritual.

"As a result, Lumian Lee's emotions and desires were vented, and his
importance was no longer suppressed by his fear of loss. His connections
with Franca Roland and Celia Bello became stronger and closer, providing
him with two strong anchors during his advancement to demigod, helping
him stabilize his consciousness.

"The third and final phase of psychological treatment ended, and Lumian
Lee could now withstand new blows.

†

"During the vortex ritual, Lumian's team fell into a desperate
situation. All his teammates, except him, were about to be killed or
taken away by Higdon of the Order of All Extinction in a few minutes.

"Lumian Lee wanted to ask Amon for help, but Amon chose to refuse
because He wasn't Lumian Lee's godfather and had no obligation, even
though Lumian Lee had indeed become more like Amon, using loopholes more
skillfully after repeatedly receiving boons from Amon.

"Relying solely on himself and those few Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts,
Lumian Lee couldn't save his teammates because Voisin Sanson and others
would also assist Higdon shortly.

"Lumian Lee now has only one choice, to ascend to demigod on the spot.
But Amon is unwilling to help him shatter the Sword of Courage,
returning the Sword of Courage to a Beyonder characteristic, and his
Iron-blooded Knight ritual is still incomplete.

"Amon tells him that the only help He would provide is to shatter the
Black Tear, give him the supplementary ingredients missing for the
Despair potion, and send him to Morora to complete the ritual using the
exiles there, ascending to Demoness of Despair.

"Becoming a Demoness of Despair, Lumian Lee, wielding the Sword of
Courage, successfully saves his teammates. Then, he would switch between
the Demoness and Hunter pathways, spiraling upwards. This doesn't need
to be symmetrical, depending on the situation, aiming to fulfill the
phrase 'pure yin does not last, pure yang does not grow, yin contains
yang, yang contains yin, the union of yin and yang gives rise to
everything.'

"This is the only correct way to approach the peak power of the two
calamity pathways. Alista Tudor and Cheek's attempts failed; not only
did They fail to succeed, but They also created a big trouble.

"In this process, Aurore Lee's soul fragments will gradually revive when
Lumian Lee is in the Demoness state.

"If Lumian Lee can ultimately defeat Red Angel Medici and Primordial
Demoness Cheek, mastering the peak power of the two calamity pathways,
Aurore Lee's personality and soul fragments can rely on Lumian's own
spirit and flesh to resurrect. Then, they can merge with his
consciousness, suppressing the corruption of inevitability, and become
his female form, controlling the feminine side of calamity. This is the
true union of yin and yang, similar to the Medici evil spirit's current
state but closer to the peak.

"This is also the only way to truly revive Aurore Lee."

Amon paused, looking at Lumian, who seemed to have turned into a statue,
raised His chin slightly, revealed a faint smile, and recited the final
sentence, "Can you accept such an outcome?"
