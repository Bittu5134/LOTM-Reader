## Chapter 1165: Two Star Dominions

After sealing off the spirit world and sensing the intrusion of the
remaining Great Old Dominators, Klein turned his attention to the
Evernight Goddess, who had not yet fully accommodated the River of
Eternal Darkness, and the Celestial Master, who was still making final
preparations---both masters of a sefirah.

Klein seized the remaining moments to take one crucial action.

Using the authority of the Door pathway, he "transferred" all the
remaining people and objects not aligned with the Outer Deities from
this star dominion to another, significantly more distant star dominion.

This was both to buy more time for his allies and to scatter the enemy
forces, splitting the battlefield and minimizing interference between
the symbolisms being utilized in each area.

Klein could have replicated the balancing abilities of the Justiciar
pathway to evenly split forces across battlegrounds, but this would have
had limited effect on the Great Old Dominators and would have hindered
his ability to intervene in the other battlefield.

At the level of the Great Old Ones, it was possible to respond to
prayers across the universe and exert influence on it as a whole.
However, in actual combat, the immediate area of effect was usually
limited to a single star system or the radiation zone of a black hole.
This level of influence was mainly achieved by reality-oriented
symbolisms like those of Supernova Dominator or Calamity of Destruction.

In simpler terms, Lumian could reduce or increase the frequency of
disasters across the entire universe or create disasters in any known
location, but his sensing range did not exceed a large star system
unless pre-established mystical connections existed in those areas.

During combat, Lumian's short-term symbolic impacts also remained mostly
confined to this range, with only minor, manageable disruptions
spreading throughout the universe. The farther from the battlefield, the
weaker the disturbance.

In this context, using the power of the Door pathway to separate the two
battlefields by distance effectively reduced Klein's susceptibility to
the negative effects of the symbolic influences wielded by Outer Deities
like the High-Dimensional Overseer and the Monarch of Decay. At the same
time, it preserved his capacity as the King of Space-Time to intervene
in the other battlefield when necessary.

This was also a tactic to manipulate the enemies---redirecting Their
target objectives and scattering Their actions. Klein could then
allocate time to intercept those he wished to confront, avoid those he
had to bypass for now, and deceive those he hoped to mislead.

Neither Lumian, the Evernight Goddess who was in the process of
accommodating the River of Eternal Darkness, nor other sefirah holders
like Grisha Adam opposed the Lord of Mysteries' transfer, allowing the
star dominion to transform. Lifeless planets and several stars from
different directions emerged before them.

With their objectives abruptly removed, the Great Old Dominators
immediately prepared to leap through the astral world to pursue them.

None of Them sought to stay behind and confront Lord of Mysteries Klein.

Though many among Them deeply coveted Sefirah Castle, the Uniquenesses
of the Fool, Door, and Error pathways, their instincts told Them that it
was easier and more practical to pursue the sefirot that had not yet
developed full consciousness. Why take the immense risk of engaging a
Pillar to seize His sefirot?

Besides, it wasn't as if They could fully accommodate it!

Even if some Great Old Dominator was tempted to target the Lord of
Mysteries, They had to consider a harsh reality: They couldn't act
alone. And without the Uncertain Mist to coordinate and unify Them into
an alliance, none dared bet on receiving support if They stayed behind.
If left alone against Klein, the fate of Genie could very well repeat
itself---albeit with much greater difficulty.

The roles of hunter and prey could reverse!

As some of the Great Old Dominators entered the astral world, Grisha
Adam, in a different star dominion, suddenly showed an expression of
pain.

He immediately broke free from the massive cross He was bound to,
transforming into a radiant giant whose head reached the astral realm.
Beneath His feet lay the Chaos Sea, encompassing all colors and
possibilities. Behind Him trailed a long shadow with five heads, while a
sun blazed at the back of His head. Storms and lightning swirled around
Him, and in His hands, He held a white tower made of books, adorned with
brass eyes.

He raised His right hand and pointed toward the astral world. Instantly,
abstract concepts and symbolic markers there descended into chaos,
delaying the Great Old Dominators from reaching this star dominion.

Lord of the Astral World!

Grisha Adam, temporarily achieving balance through the return of the
Uniquenesses of the White Tower and Tyrant pathways, forcibly manifested
a state close to that of a Great Old One and employed the most critical
symbolism of Omniscience and Omnipotency to disrupt the astral world,
buying time.

The Great Old Dominators, now delayed or disoriented in the astral
world, or still preparing to enter it, simultaneously encountered Lord
of Mysteries Klein.

The Goddess of Fate appeared with three bodies standing side by side,
all female in form and dressed in simple but elegant white dresses.

The figure on the left had hollow eyes and swiftly used both hands and
an illusory loom to weave silvery drops of destiny into a net, which
converged into streams.

These streams flowed to the middle body, which lacked arms, arriving at
the present node of the River of Fate, merging into it and surging
toward the void's edge.

The figure on the right was headless, holding an illusory silver-black
knife in its hands, cutting away portions of the River of Fate's
tributaries.

The Weaver of All Fates, the symbol of ultimate judgment, the eternal
Goddess of the Future!

As the Goddess of Fate was about to enter the astral world, distorted
shadows emerged within the silvery, illusory River of Fate.

They swam from the past and future toward the present node and toward
the true form of the Goddess of Fate.

This brought a tolling, causing the flow of the River of Fate to
stagnate.

Meanwhile, Supernova Dominator, composed of countless exploding suns,
found Himself surrounded by one starry door after another.

These brilliant doors filled the cosmos, bending and shattering under
His intense gravitational pull.

Yet, every time a door broke, another appeared in its place, covering
the star dominion and blocking the path to the astral world with
countless layers of overlapping gates.

Layers upon layers of doors!

The Mother Tree of Desire resembled a humanoid giant tree covered in
chaotic scales. Its surface was adorned with enticing crystalline
fruits, glistening alluring flowers, various metallic emblems, black
hearts, bare tumors, and coins from different civilizations.

At the tree's upper reaches were two heads. The lower head was male,
eyes closed, exuding bizarre desires. The upper head was female, with
green hair and a face of extraordinary beauty, possessing a charm that
spoke directly to affection.

One after another, Kleins wearing half-silk top hats and black trench
coats surrounded the Mother Tree of Desire in the void. All were
marionettes---dead people, puppets devoid of desire.

Simultaneously participating in three battles, Lord of Mysteries Klein
also turned his gaze to the Circle of Inevitability.

This was formed by three bodies arranged in a circle. The one facing
left was pitch black, with a sinister, malicious visage seemingly
composed of the deepest, most chaotic sins. The one facing forward was
silvery, emaciated, and filled with pain. The one facing right radiated
pure, redemptive holy light, emanating solemnity and compassion toward
all things.

The light of the three bodies intertwined into a silvery-black hue.

After brief deliberation, Klein decided not to stop the Circle of
Inevitability from entering the astral world.

This was based on Genie's first hint: "the Circle of Inevitability will
bring calamity but is also the universe's most powerful and genuine
Angel of Redemption"---a key to surviving the apocalypse.

In this matter, Klein chose to trust Genie. If his side failed, many
Great Old Dominators coveting the Nation of Disorder would turn to seize
the Magic Wishing Lamp, leveraging its connection to the Uncertain Mist
to strike down and devour Him in His weakened state.

For the moment, Klein's battlefield would remain relatively stable, with
occasional bursts of change and intensity. However, the other
battlefield would inevitably descend into chaos. One of the essences of
fate was chaos, and placing the Circle of Inevitability there increased
the likelihood of creating opportunities amidst the disorder!

Opting not to intercept the Circle of Inevitability, Klein seized the
chance to Blink to Primordial Hunger, who was eager to reach the astral
world, tossed a Deceit, and disappeared.

Primordial Hunger was a dark vortex revealing bared white teeth and
chaotic liquid encompassing all colors. His exterior no longer featured
elongated black shadows with different heads, as they seemed to have
been consumed by Himself long ago.

After being struck by Deceit, Primordial Hunger's ring of gaping white
teeth snapped twice without finding anything amiss. He ignored the
deception and proceeded straight into the astral world.

His illusory stomach gurgled, awaiting the digestion of His most
delectable meal.

Grisha Adam's influence on the astral world didn't last long---only two
or three seconds before five Great Old Dominators reached their target
star dominions through various means.

At that moment, They lost "sight" of the light.

The already dark universe seemed even more deathly still. Distant stars,
the radiant giant striding across the Chaos Sea, Lumian with his three
heads and six arms as the Origins of Disaster, and other entities were
submerged in intense, inky blackness.

An illusory, straight, unfathomable, colorless river flowed forth from
the darkness, heading toward the five Great Old Dominators.

Upon its phantom waters, nothing could float. Asteroids attempting to
cross the river sank into its depths, yet one figure stood unwavering on
its surface.

It was an extraordinarily massive female figure clad in a layered but
unadorned black gown, with an iron crown upon Her head and a thin veil
covering Her face, rendering Her features indistinct yet imbued with a
tranquil beauty.

Her body was studded with points of starlight. Pale wings sprouted from
Her back, while two short, darkly furred arms each extended from under
Her ribs and armpits, clutching a dusk-orange greatsword and a black,
night-like scythe. Her exposed forearms and hands appeared like sculpted
jade, cradled an illusory book formed of coiled feathered serpents.

Eternal Darkness!

Evernight Goddess Amanises had finally accommodated the River of Eternal
Darkness with the assistance of the lingering consciousnesses of the Dao
integrators from the Haoli lineage!
