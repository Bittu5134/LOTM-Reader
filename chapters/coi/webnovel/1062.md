## Chapter 1062: Mission

After Lumian called out that name, the image reflected on the mirror's
surface shattered, like a stone thrown into a lake.

"Zarathushtra? No, in the real world, we should call Him Zaratul."
Franca also recognized who those eyes belonged to.

Jenna added, "The Celestial Worthy's subordinates are cooperating with
the Malady God's bestowed?

"What's the purpose of this Tudor coin?"

Lumian first shook his head, then said, "Mocoxidos only received the
Sequence 3 boon after the Vortex event. I suspect that whoever possessed
that palm---the cooperation between the Celestial Worthy's subordinates
and the Malady God's blessed ones---is an aftershock of the Vortex
event, or rather, a result of one of its branches.

"Such a massive event, involving so many great existences, definitely
can't be ended just because the one the Aurora Order believes in says
so.

"This might be why He changed His stance, hoping for Mr. Fool to awaken
soon."

Franca and the others nodded---Ludwig had been taken care of by Jenna
while Lumian was performing Magic Mirror Divination, changing out of his
wet clothes, and was now once again a clean and fresh little boy.

"The Tudor coin's purpose involves the schemes of great existences, so
we probably can't divine its purpose," Lumian pondered aloud. "But we
can try to divine who owned the coin before its previous owner, which
might yield some insights."

He immediately put his words into action, again seeking Mr. Fool's
observation to eliminate certain dangers and interference.

"Who was the owner before the previous owner of this coin...

"Who was the owner before the previous owner of this coin...

"..."

Lumian held the dark gold coin, chanting the question several times.

The mirror placed before him suddenly became bright, as if there was a
light source bursting from within.

No, that was formless, colorless flames burning---the entire mirror had
caught fire.

Thin gray fog descended, preventing the flames from spreading, but the
mirror and desk quickly turned to ashes.

Seeing this, Franca's first two thoughts were: *There really is great
danger. Good thing we were careful enough, and good thing Mr. Fool is so
powerful!*

*That was scary---fortunately, I had already collected all the coins
from the drawer...*

After the formless, colorless flames extinguished, Lumian, as the 0-01
proxy, laughed with a slightly deep voice.

"I know where this Tudor coin came from:

"Fourth Epoch Trier!"

Everyone present, except Ludwig, had been to Fourth Epoch Trier, and
this revelation sparked certain associations in their minds.

"The goal of cooperation between the Malady God's bestowed and the
Celestial Worthy's subordinates points to Fourth Epoch Trier?" Franca
said thoughtfully. "Will this Tudor coin serve as a medium for some
purpose then?"

Lumian nodded and placed the Tudor coin into the Traveler's Bag. "What
we need to do next is search for clues about Zaratul's whereabouts and
uncover more of the Celestial Worthy's subordinates and members of the
Order of All Extinction."

Then, he said to Anthony, "We don't know how long we'll have to wait for
Madam Justice, so we can first get the Manipulator's potion formula and
try collecting and preparing the ingredients ourselves. If we run into
difficulties, we can ask for their help then."

Manipulator was the name of the Sequence 4 potion in the Spectator
pathway, and it was Anthony's next Sequence.

"I have no objections," Anthony agreed, feeling they couldn't pin all
their hopes on Madam Justice finding that ancient dragon.

Lumian then turned to Jenna. "Julien will be back in two days. Have you
figured out what to do?"

Jenna was silent for a few seconds before saying, "I'll use money and
Instigation to help create a good position for him in Port LeSeur,
Suhit, or Nouvell---one of these big cities---with a three-year term.

"And then..."

Jenna paused before continuing, "If Julien won't listen to my persuasion
and insists on staying, I'll get Anthony to help me 'convince' him with
some degree of hypnosis."

"Wh---" Franca blurted out in surprise.

*Wasn't this the approach Jenna had been quite opposed to and unwilling
to use?*

*She didn't want to use Beyonder powers to influence Julien or interfere
with his personal choices!*

Jenna gave a self-mocking smile.

"If this were a choice that would affect Julien's entire life, I
definitely wouldn't do this, but for just three years, I can accept it."

The smile gradually disappeared from her face as she muttered to
herself, "Life is about constantly moving forward while giving up
certain principles...

"At this point, some obsessions with purity can be discarded. Demonesses
are meant to bear pain and torment. Whether I become harsh or
cold-hearted doesn't matter---what matters is whether Julien can escape
his dangerous situation."

At this point, Jenna mocked herself again, "Let's push the guilt and
blame onto divinity, just consider it the price I pay for obtaining
godhood."

"No, a certain someone will bear all of this sin," Lumian responded in a
joking tone.

Then he nodded. "This is the best solution. It's like moving house---if
you have plenty of time, many days ahead, then naturally you can
carefully pack and organize, abandon nothing, break nothing. But if you
only have a few minutes before the room explodes and you can't prevent
it, you can only take what's most important and essential, leaving
everything else to be destroyed no matter how reluctant you are."

As they listened, Franca, Jenna, and Anthony suddenly realized that
Lumian was actually talking about the conflict between humanity and
godhood, about what Beyonders should do as they advance sequence by
sequence.

Lumian was speaking from experience, thinking of his previous
conversation with Mr. Fool.

For the sake of more important things, this was the only choice.

*Was it worth it?*

*It's worth it.*

"Indeed." Franca sighed, then turned to Jenna and said, "Actually, have
you considered teaching your brother mystical knowledge and collecting
corresponding potions for him, letting him become a Beyonder? This way,
he could understand why he must leave Trier."

Jenna slowly shook her head.

"No, I know him well. He's a very stubborn person. Once he understands
the real reason, if I don't leave, he won't either, and I..."

At this point, Jenna's gaze swept across Lumian and Franca.

Then, after some thought, she said, "The hypnosis will still be
necessary, but that doesn't conflict with teaching Julien mystical
knowledge and guiding him to become a Beyonder.

"Yes, even just a low sequence would improve his ability to protect
himself, but we absolutely cannot tell him about the approaching
apocalypse or that major changes will happen in Trier within a year or
two. That would make him anxious, and when he's anxious, he tends to go
to extremes and take wrong paths."

"Then we need to choose a good pathway for him, at least not obviously
problematic ones like Devil, Prisoner, Earth, Moon, or Assassin." Franca
helped think it through.

In the end, she still felt that, being Demonesses, flipping a coin and
relying on spirituality to choose might yield better accuracy.

†

In the afternoon.

Since Jenna was taking the slightly taller Ludwig shopping for new
clothes with Franca accompanying them, and Anthony had gone out to meet
his informant and contact members of the Psychology Alchemists, Lumian
was left alone in the large villa.

He collapsed onto the sofa, wondering whether he should contract a
spirit world creature specialized in house cleaning.

After resting for a while, Lumian contemplated the tasks ahead and his
responsibilities as the Major Arcana---The Chariot.

*First is to consolidate and deepen the faith of the Sick Church's
believers in me and Franca.*

*Second, I need to consider the Sequence 2 issue. I have the Demoness of
Catastrophe potion formula, but as a Demoness of Unaging, I still don't
know how difficult Demonesses of Catastrophe are to kill. Plus, they
have the protection of the Primordial Demoness, and Mr. Fool is only in
a preliminary awakened state... The best choice would be the Sequence 2
Weather Warlock from the Hunter pathway. During the previous divine
assembly, Mr. Fool showed the Red Priest card---I could exchange the
potion formula from him.*

*Besides the Sauron family and Einhorn family, where else might there be
Weather Warlock's Beyonder characteristics? Some Grade 0 Sealed Artifact
in a Church?*

*If there weren't any other choices, I'd rather not go to the Blue
Avenger's treasury and face that Alista Tudor inside the
mirror...*

*Heh heh, maybe I have no choice...*

*Among the Tarot Club's missions, I'm not responsible for the Great
Mother matters right now, but with my current condition, it's very
difficult to truly avoid it... For now, I just need to find Zaratul's
whereabouts and members of the Order of All Extinction... The first task
isn't easy---even Mr. Fool, as a supreme being of the Seer pathway,
hasn't located Zaratul...* At this point, Lumian suddenly sensed
something and turned his gaze toward the edge of the living room.

His messenger, who looked like a charred corpse, Penitent Baynfel,
appeared holding a letter.

Lumian stared for a few seconds at Bayenfeld, whose eye sockets burned
with dark flames, before finally speaking, "Give me the letter."

He then took the letter and opened it, finding the contents were simple.

"I would like to visit you this evening, if possible?

"The Hermit."

What does Ma'am Hermit want? My previous speculation about the Hidden
Sage state? Lumian nodded thoughtfully and said to Baynfel, "Please help
me reply to the sender, tell her it's fine."

Baynfel nodded and disappeared at the edge of the living room.

In the evening, just as night fell, Lumian, Franca, Jenna, and the
others who had been waiting heard the doorbell ring.

*Ding dong, ding dong.*

"Ma'am Hermit is so polite..." After getting used to Madam Magician's
style of suddenly appearing and disappearing and rarely using doors,
Lumian felt somewhat unaccustomed to this situation.

He personally went to open the door and found it was indeed Ma'am
Hermit, wearing thick glasses and a purple-patterned robe.

After exchanging greetings, he led his peer, a king of the seas, into
the living room and invited her to sit in an armchair.

Lumian sat down next to Franca and Jenna, and after just a few moments
of small talk, heard Ma'am Hermit say directly, "I have something I'd
like your help with."

"What is it?" Lumian asked thoughtfully.

The Hermit looked up toward the ceiling without immediately answering.

The next second, thin gray fog spread throughout the living room.

*Wh---* Lumian realized things weren't as simple as he had
imagined.

After everyone sat up straight, The Hermit said in a low voice, "Mr.
Fool is preparing to hunt down the Hidden Sage."
