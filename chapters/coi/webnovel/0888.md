## Chapter 888: Changes in Abilities from Pathway Switching

After describing the Fire of Destruction, Lumian frowned and said, "I've
heard that members of the Demoness sect have a tradition of turning
their lovers into females. Are there no Beyonders of the Hunter pathway
among their lovers?"

This question was essentially still asking "Why me?"

Couldn't they just find any Sequence 5 of the Hunter pathway, seduce
them to jump to Demoness of Despair, and satisfy the requirement of "yin
contains yang, yang contains yin"? Why did I have to be arranged?

"Perhaps only you could very easily enter the area around the Samaritan
Woman's Spring and obtain the remnant aura of the Blood Emperor, thus
having mystical similarity with 0-01." Madam Magician fully understood
what Lumian was concerned about.

Lumian continued asking, as if talking to himself, "The Red Angel has
ways to control 0-01 without relying on mystical similarity. Since that
individual has no selfish motives and isn't afraid of the Red Angel's
revenge, why not directly reinvest in Him, instead of grooming a
'weakling' like me?"

*Isn't this a waste of time?*

Madam Magician glanced at the field ridge under her feet.

"I can answer this for you. First, the Red Angel can't get as close to
the top powers of the two Calamity pathways as you can, unless His next
step isn't to reclaim 0-01 and become the Red Priest, but to find a way
to replace the Primordial Demoness. Second, the birth of a Red Priest is
inevitably accompanied by competition, chaos, and disaster. Only through
multi-party competition can a Red Priest emerge in the shortest time in
the best way. If only the Red Angel were to walk this path, it wouldn't
go smoothly."

"Am I competing with Him?" Lumian curled his lips in a self-mocking
smile. "Then I should thank that individual for giving me this
qualification."

As for ability, that was still far off.

Madam Magician continued, "Many members of the Demoness sect indeed have
lovers from the Hunter pathway, but they rarely let these male lovers
switch pathways and become female at Sequence 5. On the one hand, there
are very few members of the Demoness sect who can get their hands on two
Demoness of Despair Beyonder characteristics. On the other hand, they
seem to be avoiding similar things. As far as I know, among the
demigod-level Demonesses, only one was formerly a Hunter."

"Who?" Lumian immediately became alert like a Hunter.

Madam Magician smiled and said, "The Demoness of Cyan, Yalenna.

"She is a Sequence 3 Demoness of Unaging. Her mother is the leader of
the Demoness sect, the Demoness of Gray Judith. Her father was a Hunter,
who later went missing, suspected to have been killed by the Demoness of
Gray."

Lumian pondered for a moment and said, "Could the Demoness of Gray have
also been a Hunter before?

"Her twin sister Krismona was born female, born a Demoness. As a
contrast, is it possible that She was born male, born a Hunter, until
She transformed into a Demoness at Sequence 4?

"The Demoness of Black only mentioned that the Demoness of Black was
Sequence 9 at birth, but never said that her Sequence 9 equaled
Assassin."

"It's possible, but currently unverifiable. The Demoness of Gray is
older than all of our Tarot Club's Major Arcana card holders combined.
We don't know much about Her," Madam Magician said, a hint of a smile
appearing on her face as if she had thought of something.

*Is that so? I thought you were an Angel from the early Fifth Epoch,
given that your teacher was Mr. Door, the strongest King of Angels of
the Fourth Epoch...* Lumian didn't voice these words about a
woman's age.

He began to walk slowly again, pondering as he spoke, "Is the Demoness
sect, or rather the Primordial Demoness's hatred for pure female
Demonesses really due to inner distortion? Is there no other mystical
reason?"

Pure female Demonesses apparently wouldn't have the chance to touch the
power at the top of the two Calamity pathways, so they should pose the
least threat to the Primordial Demoness.

"Inner distortion is one reason, but my intuition tells me it's not the
whole reason," Madam Magician said, turning her head to look at the New
City of Silver where lights were gradually coming on. "The Seven of Cups
is about to advance to Demoness of Affliction. You can try to get some
intelligence on this from Krismona's remnant projection."

Lumian didn't continue this topic, instead returning to discuss the
changes in his abilities after becoming a Demoness of Despair.

This was also something he had to do after his condition initially
stabilized.

"At the Demoness of Despair stage, Disease has evolved into Plague that
can cover a range of three kilometers. I currently have mastered three
types of plagues. One is derived from the original Disease, targeting
the flesh of relatively common creatures, mainly infecting organs such
as the heart, brain, and lungs. From the incubation period to the
outbreak of symptoms to becoming severe, it only takes about ten
seconds, and then within another minute, it can cause the target to
deteriorate to near death. The specific time varies depending on the
enemy's status and constitution.

"The second type of plague is Weakening, originating from the mystical
pathogen inherent in Black Tear. It can gradually strip away the
target's strength until even their heart is too weak to beat. At the
same time, it causes a gradual loss of spirituality. In other words, it
can not only target relatively common creatures but also affect special
creatures and even the dead. Any target with spirituality or relying on
spirituality will gradually weaken because of it.

"The third type of plague is Rigidity. Over time, it causes even zombies
to become rigid and stiff, becoming inflexible. This is a more
mystically oriented plague.

"The fusion of Hunter traits with the plagues has given these mystical
pathogens a certain resistance to fire. They won't quickly wither away
under fire burning conditions and can persist for a longer time. Among
them, the Weakening plague can inherently survive in high temperatures
for a period, and its current fire resistance is the strongest among the
three plagues.

"For dealing with these plagues, the burning of Demoness black flames
and freezing over a certain range are better methods.

"I can also create my own unique plague varieties by combining my own
traits, corresponding mystical knowledge, specific ideas and
experiments, and possibly required special materials. This takes a long
time and can't yield results quickly. But regardless, a Demoness's
Plague can only target things with spirituality and cannot cause rocks
or metals to weather, rust, or decay like the demigods of the Order of
All Extinction.

"In using Precision, a Hunter's Precision can help me maintain two types
of plagues simultaneously, but it requires three to four times the
spirituality consumption of maintaining a single plague."

Madam Magician nodded lightly, not interrupting Lumian's self-analysis.

"The Demoness of Despair's mastery of the mirror world and mirror magic
has reached a considerably deep stage. I can locate mirrors within a
five-kilometer range and mirrors I've visited before. I can traverse
freely in the mirror world and transmit information through the mirror
world to those located mirrors, displaying it. This is much more
convenient than messengers, but there's a possibility of the information
being intercepted by mirror world creatures. Some curses need to be
attached to the information to avoid most troubles.

"I can also use located mirrors to project myself there, looking just
like the real thing. Currently, this projection has distance limitations
and cannot exceed a city.

"A Hunter's Precision has also fused with this Mirror Projection
ability, allowing me to complete three to five projections
simultaneously, with each projection having some power and able to
accomplish some things, though they cannot leave the range reflected by
the corresponding mirror."

When fighting against the Order of All Extinction demigod, Higdon,
Lumian had used the power of the special mirror world to create many
Mirror Projections. If Higdon had ignored them at that time, these
illusions and projections could have caused a certain degree of damage!

"Other mirror magic, such as Mirror Maze, Mirror Substitution, and Magic
Mirror Divination, have also reached the level of Sequence 4. Among
them, curses completed through mirrors include normal types, those fused
with Cull that can erupt fiercely in an extremely short time, and those
mixed with the power of Inevitability that can complete fate-related
curses," Lumian pondered as he spoke. "Fate-related curses can put the
target in a state of misfortune for a period of time. This is not easily
noticed by them and is used against enemies who inherently have strong
curse prevention abilities."

Lumian paused, then continued, "Like other Demonesses of Despair, if
enemies can't replace themselves with a substitution before I lock onto
them and complete the curse, they won't be able to transfer or share the
damage even if they have a Mirror Substitution or Paper Figurine
Substitute.

"The Demoness's spider silk has also changed, becoming more solid, more
tough, able to complete more tasks, including restraining, binding,
interfering, transmitting pleasure, black flames, and curses. At the
same time, the fusion of Hunter traits has made these spider silks
sharper, able to directly cause a certain degree of damage.

"My hair is the source of spider silk. If an enemy's body is touched by
my hair, the corresponding part will experience some petrification
symptoms.

"Weakness Investigation is no longer limited to discovering weaknesses
and vulnerabilities in the flesh, soul, and defenses, as well as fate
streams that can lead to death, but also includes the target's emotional
and desire weaknesses and trigger points.

"Cull has fused with the Demoness pathway's Mighty Blow, capable of
bringing more terrifying damage. I can take out some physically fragile
demigods in one strike."

"Physically fragile demigods often have many mystically oriented
life-saving abilities, or make it impossible for you to find their true
form," Madam Magician reminded at this point.

Lumian nodded, indicating he would remember.

"Other abilities include black magic like Invisibility, the ability to
manipulate frost, Wand Substitution, basic divination abilities, which
are all the same as a normal Demoness of Despair.

"Instigation and Provocation have fused together, granting me the
ability to use language and attached mystical power to stir up the
target's emotions and desires, making them do what I anticipate.

"Pleasure can be combined with Cull and Precision...

"...

"That's about it."

Madam Magician nodded thoughtfully and remarked, "Jumping to a
neighboring pathway indeed brings many strange changes and mixed
abilities. This is not something that can be achieved by using the
neighboring pathways' Sealed Artifacts."

Lumian gave an affirmative sound, then asked, "Should we still have
Franca continue undercover in the Demoness sect?"
