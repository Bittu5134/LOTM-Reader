## Chapter 1039: Every Beginning is Difficult

At the telegraph office in the arts district.

Still wearing her sun hat and black veil, Jenna paid the telegram fee
and gazed at the constant tinkling sounds next door, muttering to
herself, "What are they renovating?"

A male telegraph operator looked up and said with a mixture of disdain
and worry,

"The telephone office.

"They say they want to develop wired telephones extensively. Can they
really lay lines to so many places? In the end, they'll have to rely on
wireless!"

*Yes, mobile phones should also be a type of wireless...* Jenna
suddenly felt nostalgic.

She was also looking forward to the development of telephone networks in
Intis. That way they could communicate in real-time instead of going
through the trouble of sending and receiving telegrams.

Walking out of the telegraph office, before Jenna could decide whether
to take a carriage back to the luxurious villa or browse around the
neighborhood, she heard a newspaper boy shouting at the intersection:

"Extra! Extra!

"Ms. Fors promises to finalize 'The Great Adventurer 7' within two
weeks!

"Extra! Extra!

"The large generator manufactured by the Church of Steam's Deep Valley
Cloister has entered the factory production stage!"

*Large generator...* Jenna paused for a moment, her gaze
involuntarily drawn to the horse-drawn trams on the road, women wearing
different styles of sun hats, men carrying canes and wearing top hats,
classical-style gas street lamps, luxurious theaters and nearby cafes,
and various shops.

This hardly looked like a scene approaching the apocalypse.

Jenna gazed greedily at everything, worried it would suddenly dissipate
like the dream city.

___

In the luxurious villa.

Lumian stood before the full-length mirror, staring motionlessly at his
beautiful face that was both familiar and strange.

He was waiting, waiting for the reflection to smile on its own or show
some other expression.

One of the major difficulties in the Demoness of Unaging advancement
ritual was finding one's Mirror Person---this wasn't something one could
encounter just by wanting to.

The mystical connection between a Demoness and their Mirror Person
served both as a locating aid and as an alarm that allowed the other
party to detect danger early and constantly relocate.

Moreover, according to the actual experiences and daily observations of
the three Demonesses---Lumian, Franca, and Jenna---the stable Mirror
People born from becoming Demonesses were different from those Mirror
People in special mirror worlds.

Under normal circumstances, the Demonesses' Mirror People could not
leave the mirror world. Once these Mirror People entered reality, it
meant there was a major problem with the Demoness's own state.

"We'll still need to ask Madam Magician for help with positioning and
containment..." Lumian, who had been watching the mirror image for an
hour, withdrew his gaze and muttered to himself.

At that moment, Madam Magician appeared in the bedroom, surrounded by
twinkling starlight.

She looked around and asked, "Where's Two of Cups?"

"She went to meet with her subordinate, preparing for tomorrow's meeting
with the Demoness of Black," Lumian answered simply.

Madam Magician frowned and said, "Is she still going to continue with
the Demoness Sect's missions?

"At the Sequence 4 demigod stage, the Demoness of Despair only provides
potions and helps prepare rituals. How will Two of Cups explain how she
was able to advance to Demoness of Despair, where the potion formula and
corresponding ingredients came from, and how the ritual was completed?"

"No explanation is needed. Her advancement to Sequence 4 was completed
under the Primordial Demoness's watch, and these past few days, she
often takes out that white bone figurine and places it beside her, with
no abnormalities or dangers arising," Lumian explained on Franca's
behalf. "This situation makes her feel she still has value to the
Demoness Sect, or rather, to the Primordial Demoness. When the time
comes, she can make up a convincing reason that the Demoness of Black
should believe, such as divine bestowal or divine favor.

"She can also take this opportunity to learn more mystical knowledge
about Mirror People from the Demoness of Black, which might prove useful
in the upcoming Demoness of Unaging ritual."

Madam Magician looked at Lumian for several seconds. "This is
dangerous."

"We know," Lumian replied in a low voice.

Madam Magician sighed and said, "When she goes to meet the Demoness of
Black tomorrow, remember to notify me in advance. I'll provide necessary
protection nearby."

"Thank you," Lumian then asked, "Why did you suddenly come over? Is
something wrong?"

*Weren't we supposed to wait until we gathered all the information
before setting a time for the ritual?*

Madam Magician made no attempt to hide it, her expression becoming quite
complex.

"To have a small meeting."

"Small meeting?" Lumian raised an eyebrow.

"A small meeting means a private gathering without Mr. Fool present, but
still held in the palace above the gray fog," Madam Magician explained
briefly. "Previously it was fixed at once a month, but now that formal
meetings have resumed and are fixed for 3 pm on the first Monday of each
month, we obviously can't continue with the small meetings in the same
way. They might become more impromptu in nature, specifically convened
for special matters."

"This discussion..." Lumian asked thoughtfully, "Is it to unify the
Major Arcana's understanding of Gehrman Sparrow?"

"Yes," Madam Magician nodded slightly. "In half an hour, recite Mr.
Fool's honorific name."

After speaking, her figure transformed into countless starlight and flew
into the illusory door.

Half an hour later, Lumian recited Mr. Fool's honorific name and once
again arrived above the gray fog, sitting at one side of the bronze long
table.

In his eyes, streaks of light were rising up, condensing into slightly
blurred figures in different seats.

In less than a minute, all the Major Arcana card holders were present.

After glancing at Madam Justice, The Magician began speaking.

"I just returned from Two of Cups. She compared the current Mr. Fool, or
rather Gehrman Sparrow's image, to an AI..."

After roughly repeating Franca's original words, this lady said, "I
think it makes sense. We must quickly unify our understanding of Gehrman
Sparrow to minimize the corruption of the faith anchors."

Madam Justice picked up the thread.

"The most fundamental and widespread public perceptions of Gehrman
Sparrow don't need to be changed, and can't be changed in the short
term---these themselves don't contain contradictions.

"What we need to do is make the Gehrman Sparrow beneath this shell
closer to Mr. Fool's true self, and ensure there are no contradictions.

"Since we want to unify this understanding, we must start with
ourselves. If our own understandings still differ and contain major
contradictions, it will certainly affect later corrections and
dissemination."

Seeing all the Major Arcana card holders nodding slightly in agreement,
Madam Justice said,

"Then let's first share our impressions of Mr. Fool and Gehrman Sparrow,
record them, and then discuss which ones are correct and which can be
unified.

"Who wants to start?"

Madam Justice first looked toward Madam Magician and Mr. Star.

She found that the former showed hints of fear, seemingly afraid to
speak or listen, while the latter kept his mouth shut, appearing quite
hesitant, as if unsure which things should be said, which shouldn't, and
whether to say everything.

The Chariot Lumian clicked his tongue imperceptibly and shook his head.

"What are you thinking about?" Mr. Moon, who was sitting not far from
him, tilted his head curiously to ask.

Lumian chuckled and said, "I'm imagining how I would feel if a group of
people were discussing what kind of person I am behind my back, each
with different impressions."

"Embarrassed?" Mr. Moon couldn't help but consider it too.

The Chariot Mr. Lumian smiled and said, "I don't know if others would be
embarrassed, but for myself, I'd probably be excited, find it fun, and
wish I could sneak in to listen."

Mr. Moon raised his right hand and touched his face.

He instinctively looked at the huge chair at the head of the table, then
glanced at the position at the bottom, confirming that neither Mr. Fool
nor The World was present---truly not present.

"If it were the Sherlock Moriarty in my impression, he would genuinely
be embarrassed, but if it were Gehrman Sparrow, he would maintain a cold
expression, making it impossible to tell what he's thinking," Mr. Moon
responded to Lumian's words.

After speaking, he found that the other Major Arcana card holders were
all looking at him.

Seeing this, Lumian inwardly chuckled and muttered to himself, *See,
someone to kick things off has volunteered themselves.*

Mr. Moon froze for a moment, and seeing everyone waiting for him to
continue, he had no choice but to maintain outward composure and
continue.

"I haven't had much interaction with Gehrman Sparrow; it was mainly
above the gray fog. Many of my impressions come from rumors, centered
around words like cold, powerful, and quick-to-action.

"Comparatively, I know Sherlock Moriarty better. He's quite perceptive,
fairly vigilant, very concerned with money, but judging from his
behavior at the Harvest Church and other places, he's actually quite
caring and possesses a true gentleman's sense of humor..."

After speaking in one breath, Mr. Moon slightly raised his chin, looked
around, and said, "You guys' turn."

Madam Justice didn't wait for other Major Arcana cards, deciding to
follow Mr. Moon's example and set a model for everyone.

"I'll go.

"I was once Mr. World's psychiatrist, provided him with corresponding
treatment, and even entered the Hall of Truth with him, hearing many of
his inner thoughts."

Upon catching the term Hall of Truth, Mr. Star unconsciously adjusted
his sitting position, with his right side more forward and his left side
slightly withdrawn.

After all the Major Arcana card holders, including The Chariot Lumian,
turned to look at her, Madam Justice spoke in a steady voice,

"My deepest impression of Mr. World is that he was very lonely. He had
many things piled up in his heart and weighing on his shoulders...

"But he could still control himself, not indulging, not despairing, not
acting willfully, not becoming distorted...

"What Mr. Moon just said is correct---he was indeed a very caring
person, his heart was actually very gentle, and his cold and tough
exterior was just a facade he had put on..."

Miss Justice's gentle voice slowly echoed above the bronze long table.
