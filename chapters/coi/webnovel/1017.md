## Chapter 1017: Child

*Omebella?*

*She is also called Omebella?*

*Was the mysterious baby Madame Pualis had been carrying in Cordu
Village named Omebella? Did that empty crib belong to Omebella?*

At this moment, Lumian felt as if he had been struck by lightning.

Previously, Madam Magician had joked that as long as the dean of Mushu
Hospital wasn't named Omebella, it wouldn't be a problem. At the time,
Lumian thought it was just a horror story, and even if the dean was
really named Omebella, it shouldn't be his biggest concern. But hearing
that Madame Pualis's child was called Omebella truly sent chills down
his spine.

If it were just Madame Pualis becoming the dean of Mushu Hospital, or
just her giving birth to a mysterious child who had shown strange
qualities in Cordu Village, Lumian wouldn't have been so shocked and
frightened. These would have been unexpected but not unreasonable
events.

But the baby was named Omebella---the mysterious child Madame Pualis had
carried and given birth to in Cordu Village was called Omebella.

If Madame Pualis wasn't lying, if that baby was truly the Omebella
Lumian knew, didn't that mean he had once "coexisted" with the infant
Omebella in Cordu Village for some time? And later, he had killed
another unborn Omebella, obtained Omebella's bloodline through the
corresponding umbilical cord remnants, come into contact with the
remains of the earliest Omebella, and encountered some things and
arrangements related to Omebella!

Had all this been foreshadowed in the disaster at Cordu Village, rather
than beginning only when he ate Omebella's umbilical cord remnants?

Lumian suddenly felt as if he was back in a scene from his vagrant life.
At that time, he was huddled in a corner, watching a large, slippery,
ferocious poisonous snake slowly slithering past him, not daring to move
a muscle. Now, he seemed to feel that cold, damp, slippery sensation
crawling over him, seeping in bit by bit, silently coiling around him.

*If the baby Madame Pualis gave birth to in Cordu Village was Omebella,
then who was in Father Montserrat's belly, whom I killed?*

*Where did the umbilical cord remnants I ate come from, and why could
they help me contact the remains of the earliest Omebella? Why could
they make the Mother's children, who lacked necessary wisdom, mistake me
for the Child of God, Omebella?*

*In the depths of the Underworld, who did that egg nurtured by the
ancient god's remains point to? Why could I hear the call for
Omebella?*

*Moreover, why did the followers of the Great Mother want to induce me
to become the true Child of God, to become the real Omebella? Hadn't
Omebella already been born?*

*What is going on?*

*Which one is real, and which is fake?*

*Are they all fake? Are they all real?*

Lumian's gaze fixed on the baby in Madame Pualis's arms. He noticed her
chubby face, rosy and delicate, incredibly adorable.

"Oh, so she's Omebella. Who's her father?" Although Lumian's inner
thoughts were bubbling like boiling water in a steam boiler, outwardly
he maintained a calm demeanor.

This was a basic quality of a Hunter, and he also had the endurance of
an Ascetic.

Madame Pualis suddenly smiled. "If I said it was you or Aurore, would
you believe me?"

"Stop with the hellish jokes. We've never touched you," Lumian said,
outwardly unperturbed.

"Yes, I regret that too. I hope we'll have a chance to make up for it in
the future," Madame Pualis sighed and said, "Her mother is me, and also
the Great Mother. As for her father, on the surface, it's the padre, but
there's someone else."

*Someone else...* Just as Lumian was about to start eliminating
the villagers of Cordu Village one by one, heavy footsteps suddenly
sounded behind him.

He half-turned and saw the giant mushroom with Li Keji's head as its cap
appearing in the dim corridor.

At this moment, the smile on Madame Pualis's face faded slightly. She
said in a casual tone, "Come, the child needs you."

As soon as she finished speaking, the baby in the swaddling clothes
began to cry loudly.

Hearing this loud cry, Lumian's body instinctively, involuntarily walked
towards Madame Pualis, towards the baby Omebella.

It was like two mutually attracted magnets finally meeting.

Lumian suddenly had some realizations:

*Madame Pualis wants to do something with my body, which possesses
Omebella's bloodline!*

*After last night's events, Li Keji was quickly transferred to Mushu
Hospital for treatment, not only because the Celestial Worthy wanted to
eliminate this hidden danger and the Great Mother attempted to balance
the situation, but also because Madame Pualis planned to attract me
here!*

*I refused to seek help from the Great Mother last night to become the
true Child of God, so did the Great Mother and the Celestial Worthy
temporarily reach an agreement?*

Lumian didn't hesitate. He activated the black mark on his right
shoulder, attempting to teleport away.

His figure disappeared from the dean's office, but he didn't appear at
the entrance of the police station in the dream city.

He arrived in the wilderness again.

In the depths of the wilderness stood a gigantic green oak tree that
seemed to connect the sky and the ground. The top of the oak tree
appeared to lead to heaven, disappearing into layers of white clouds.

Lumian saw that the surface of the enormous oak tree that seemed to hold
up the sky was marked with scorch marks from lightning strikes. Its bark
was mottled, concealing vitality.

His gaze followed the complex patterns formed by the mottled bark,
instinctively moving upward. Near the top of the tree crown, he saw a
newly grown branch.

It had grown tenaciously from a charred spot caused by lightning
strikes, entwined with some lush, vibrant mistletoe.

At this moment, this new branch, along with the mistletoe, was grasped
by a chubby, fair little hand. The hand belonged to the swaddled baby
Omebella.

She wore a floral crown and was "dressed" in a fresh green dress. Madame
Pualis, whose lower body had transformed into a giant bird shape and
whose back had sprouted brown wings, held her in her arms.

"Come, the child needs you!" Madame Pualis's voice echoed across the
entire wilderness. The mushroom monster that Li Keji had become also
appeared at the edge of the wild.

Lumian attempted to teleport out to no avail. He immediately threw out a
mirror, preparing to enter the area behind the mirror, to see if he
could use the mirror world to escape this wilderness.

The next second, the glass surface of the mirror seemed to come alive,
softening and writhing, forming a "mouth" leading to a dark depth.

Lumian made a quick decision, abandoning the attempt to penetrate the
glass surface, letting the mirror fall on its own.

*Smack!*

The mirror shattered into multiple pieces, each mercury-coated glass
shard desperately crawling away.

Lumian snorted, and quiet black flames surged from within his body.
Outside the black flames, thick frost quickly condensed, as if to create
a coffin for slumber.

The invisible spider silk that had already spread throughout the
surrounding area retracted, wrapping around the frost layer by layer,
preparing to form a huge cocoon.

This was a Demoness's strongest defense mechanism, capable of both
dispelling curses and negative influences, and resisting substantial
damage.

Lumian's plan was to use this ability to buy time to actively exit the
dream or light the corpse wax candle to complete the secret deed ritual.

However, before the spider cocoon could fully form, the Demoness's black
flames seemed to take on a life of their own, truly burning Lumian's
spirituality. The ice layer that was supposed to provide defense also
began to restrict Lumian's movements.

They had all come alive!

Lumian immediately activated the black mark on his right shoulder.

He moved to the edge of the wilderness, far from the giant mushroom man,
escaping the influence of the Demoness's black flames and layers of
frost.

Although he couldn't teleport out of this wilderness, he could still
Blink around within it.

"Come, the child needs you!"

As he heard Madame Pualis's voice, Lumian ran a few steps towards the
gigantic oak tree that seemed to hold up the sky.

*No good, in this preset battlefield, within Paramita, in front of the
baby Omebella, although everyone is suppressed to the Sequence 7 level,
I'm still being very effectively restrained. I can't hold out for too
long... Should I recite Madam Magician's honorific name or utter
"Leodero," the blasphemous incantation? No, I might only have one chance
to recite the honorific name, and "Leodero" might not be able to break
the giant oak tree's seal on Paramita... If we're going down, let's go
big, everyone perish together!* As Lumian thought, he reached
into the Traveler's Bag and firmly grasped that special mirror world
fragment.

Then, he initiated teleportation again, using this to resist the
invisible pull of baby Omebella on himself and her strange ability to
bring things to life.

After Blinking to the next position, Lumian opened his mouth and quickly
recited a sentence in ancient Hermes, "Great Door of All Doors;"

Lumian was about to recite the honorific name of Chief Yagates---Mr.
Door---to attract His attention!

This represented the power of the dream subconscious maintaining order.

Although this would result in Lumian himself being permanently kicked
out of the dream, Madame Pualis, the mushroom-transformed Li Keji, and
baby Omebella here, every single one of them, wouldn't be able to
continue "staying" in the dream city!

This was equivalent to eliminating hidden dangers for Jenna, Franca, and
others in their subsequent actions.

As for what comes after, trust in teammates!

After reciting the first honorific name, Lumian teleported to another
side of the wilderness, avoiding the attacks of Madame Pualis and Li
Keji.

"Guide of the endless cosmos;"

Lumian finished one sentence and quickly disappeared from his original
spot.

Seeing this, Madame Pualis opened her mouth, about to unleash a
Banshee's Shriek.

At this moment, a male version of Lumian appeared in the wilderness.

He was a shallow mirror image created by the mirror world fragment, very
weak.

He spread his arms and shouted loudly in ancient Hermes, "Leodero!"

This voice burst out almost simultaneously with the Banshee's Shriek. As
the shallow mirror image shattered under the influence of the sound
waves, the sky above suddenly darkened.

In the darkness, dense clouds gathered, and countless silver-white
electric snakes jumped to form a huge lightning bolt, striking towards
that giant, sky-supporting green oak tree.

*Smack!*

A large number of small, silver-white electric snakes crawled over the
surface of the oak tree, creating patches of charred marks, but it
didn't completely die, still constantly regenerating.

This effect temporarily paralyzed Madame Pualis and baby Omebella.

Crack, the Mirror Substitution Lumian, who had shattered under the
Banshee's Shriek and the overflow of lightning, appeared not too far
from Li Keji, reciting the third line of the honorific name.

"Key to all mysterious worlds."
