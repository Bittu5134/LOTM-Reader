## Chapter 938: Salary

At noon, Zhang Qing, the deputy director of the administrative
department who had overseen the earlier interview, walked out of the
Tech Building, heading to a nearby mall to meet a friend.

Inside a gray sedan parked by the roadside, Franca turned her body
slightly and nodded seriously at Anthony, her expression stern.

Anthony immediately got out of the car, mingled with the crowd, and
hurriedly approached Zhang Qing from the side.

Bump! He "accidentally" bumped into the man in his thirties, causing
Zhang Qing's phone to fall to the ground.

"Sorry, sorry," Anthony apologized repeatedly, bending down to pick up
the phone. He wiped it on his clothes a few times before handing it back
to Zhang Qing.

Zhang Qing, with a dark expression, angrily scolded Anthony, "Are you
blind? How can you walk like that?"

"Sorry, really sorry," Anthony responded sincerely, with an attitude
full of remorse.

Zhang Qing stared into Anthony's eyes, which had been adjusted to a deep
brown color using the Lie earring, as if trying to determine whether the
apology was genuine or just a perfunctory excuse.

After a few seconds, he took back his phone and suddenly felt a moment
of confusion.

Zhang Qing shook his head and carefully inspected his phone, finding no
significant damage.

"Forget it, just watch your step next time!" The deputy director of the
administrative department of Intis Group's headquarters, showing some
class, waved his phone dismissively, no longer pursuing the matter.

"Really, I'm sorry. How about I buy you an iced coffee to make up for
it?" Anthony suggested, pointing to a coffee shop in the corner of the
Tech Building's first floor.

Zhang Qing's expression softened. "No need. I'm in a hurry.

"You look around my age; be more careful in the future," Zhang Qing
added before heading towards the mall at the intersection, braving the
scorching sun.

Anthony noticed that there was a long line at the coffee shop, so he
quickly ran into the convenience store next to the Tech Building's main
entrance and bought a canned coffee.

Holding the coffee, he jogged to catch up with Zhang Qing. "I'm really
sorry about earlier. This is to show my apology."

He handed over the coffee.

Zhang Qing glanced at Anthony with some suspicion, met his eyes for a
couple of seconds, then took the canned coffee and said, "You're pretty
considerate."

Zhang Qing didn't intend to drink the beverage from a stranger, but he
felt it was acceptable to accept the apology.

Just as he took the coffee, Zhang Qing had another brief moment of
confusion. Then, he felt that Anthony's apology was incredibly sincere,
and with his proactive actions, combined with the fact that they seemed
to be around the same age, Zhang Qing suddenly felt a sense of
closeness.

Seeing this, Anthony felt a bit of relief.

This was his second attempt at Hypnosis, and it finally succeeded.

The first attempt was when he returned Zhang Qing's phone, but
unfortunately, it failed.

After becoming a Sequence 6 Hypnotist, Anthony's Psychological Cue" or
Hypnosis, no longer required the assistance of candles, extract, or
other mediums. He only needed the target's attention to be genuinely
focused on something, especially his own eyes, to open the door to their
Body of Heart and Mind. If the process involved actions of giving and
receiving, the effect would be even better, and the success rate would
be higher.

Later, when Anthony advanced to Sequence 5, his application of Hypnosis
improved even further.

But now, he was suppressed to Sequence 7 in the dream, so while he could
still perform Hypnosis without the help of candles, extract, or pocket
watches, the success rate was much lower. It was rare for him to fail
when hypnotizing an ordinary person, so he had to urgently make up for
it.

"I just finished an interview and was in a hurry to get to the next one,
so I was rushing," Anthony explained further.

"Just finished an interview?" Zhang Qing, who had been influenced,
smiled and said, "I just finished one too, but I was the interviewer."

"Are you with Intis Group?" Anthony pretended to be curious.

Seventy percent of the office workers coming out of the Tech Building
were likely from Intis Group.

"Yes, with the headquarters. We were hiring for an administrative
position." Zhang Qing, for some reason, felt unusually relaxed and ended
up saying what was on his mind, "We've chosen someone, but I don't know
if Mr. Huang will reject it later. Although hiring for an administrative
role doesn't require a report to him, the HR Director can decide, but he
likes to visit the administrative department..."

At this point, Zhang Qing suddenly shut his mouth, realizing he
shouldn't be gossiping about Mr. Huang in front of an outsider.

"Your boss, Mr. Huang? He's well-known nationwide," Anthony said,
pretending to suddenly realize.

Zhang Qing smiled.

"Yes, well, the person we hired this time doesn't quite fit Mr. Huang's
aesthetic. Uh, mainly in style, though her figure is up to standard. But
since Miss Huang personally selected her, it's a done deal.

"Actually, this is a good thing. Half of the employees in the
administrative department spend their days focused on makeup and gossip,
waiting for Mr. Huang to drop by. Sometimes, I feel like a head
eunuch---no, the assistant to a head eunuch---managing the emperor's
harem, like something out of Empresses in the Palace. But now, with a
capable person joining, my stress will be much less. Otherwise, I'd
consider that slacker Luo Shan a model worker..."

Talking about these things, Zhang Qing was full of complaints.

Anthony played along perfectly, letting Zhang Qing vent a bunch of
frustrations, making him feel completely at ease.

After a while, Zhang Qing checked his watch.

"I have to go. I'm in a hurry."

He hesitated whether to add Anthony on WeChat, thinking it was rare to
meet someone he could chat with so effortlessly at this stage in life.

In the end, Zhang Qing decided not to, out of a sense of
self-importance.

Anthony hesitated as well. Adding Zhang Qing on WeChat could provide
significant convenience for Franca and Lumian's operations within Intis
Group.

But in the end, Anthony refrained, feeling that it was unwise to tie all
their connections to Intis Group, as it might be easier for the
Celestial Worthy or His subordinates to catch them all at once.

After parting ways with Zhang Qing and waiting for him to walk away,
Anthony turned and walked towards the gray sedan parked by the roadside.

He didn't get in but, as he approached the car, subtly raised his right
hand and made an "OK" gesture.

Then, he walked past the gray sedan and headed towards another
intersection.

From now on, he would have to stay alone until tomorrow.

This was because he had closely interacted with Zhang Qing and used
Beyonder powers on him. And Zhang Qing was someone close to the dream
manifestation of Mr. Fool, even if not directly.

Seeing Anthony's gesture, Franca slowly nodded, then calmly drove the
gray sedan onto the road.

Once they were far from the Tech Building, she allowed herself a
satisfied smile and, feeling triumphant, said to Lumian in the passenger
seat, "The moment I saw Miss Huang in the conference room, I knew we had
to scrap all our original plans.

"In a flash, I figured out exactly what to do!

"What do you call that? Quick thinking, the ability to adapt!"

After Franca finished boasting, Lumian chuckled and said, "Maybe that
was the real Princess Bernadette, who entered the dream specifically to
help you infiltrate Intis Group."

"..." Franca quickly adjusted her mindset and said doubtfully, "Can
Princess Bernadette actually enter the dream and control Huang Beibei's
dream manifestation? How many times has she been kicked out?"

"The Major Arcana card holders are unsure. They only know that she was
kicked out once after commissioning Zhou Mingrui to investigate the
quality of Dream Tutoring Classes. Whether she had been kicked out
before that or how many times, she hasn't told anyone," Lumian recounted
from the data. "What is certain is that the Major Arcana card holders
have synchronized our situation with her and believe she's trustworthy
and willing to help."

Franca concurred succinctly, "I hope it's true. If Mr. Huang really has
an eye for talent and comes to bother me, I can ask her to rein her dad
in."

Neither Franca nor Lumian had any faith in Emperor Roselle's or his
dream manifestation's restraint when it came to women.

†

Xinhong District, in the rented apartment, afternoon.

Lumian received a phone call.

After finishing the conversation, he turned to Franca with a smile and
said, "I got the job!"

"Phew..." Franca exhaled in visible relief.

With this, even if her own job offer ended up being vetoed by Mr. Huang,
they could still move forward with their plan to access the dream
manifestation of Mr. Fool, Zhou Mingrui, through the Intis
Group---though it would be more challenging.

Franca, now curious, asked, "What's the salary?"

"It's 3,500 yuan a month during probation, and once confirmed, it's
4,500. For now, it's just rotating between guarding the front and back
entrances of the building, patrolling different floors, and monitoring
the surveillance cameras. If I get assigned to a more important post in
the security department, the pay will go up significantly," Lumian
repeated the details from the call. "Plus, the job comes with two
uniforms."

"The Intis Group is quite generous. Given the salary standards in this
city, that's decent for a security job," Franca said, feeling happier
now that their team would have a stable source of income.

Before she could start worrying about her own offer, her phone rang.

After listening for a few moments, Franca's smile slowly blossomed. She
raised her free hand and gave Lumian a thumbs-up, signaling success.

Her offer had come through too!

"Yes, yes. No problem." After a series of confirmations, Franca's smile
suddenly froze.

After she hung up, Lumian, who had heard the conversation clearly thanks
to his Hunter's hearing, remained silent, waiting for her to speak.

With a wooden expression, Franca said, "The probation is also one month,
with a salary of 6,000, and once confirmed, it's 7,000, plus an
allowance for clothing. The Intis Group is indeed generous.

"But..."

She paused, her lips moving slightly, her expression turning a bit
dazed, before continuing, "But there's a dress code: summer attire
requires a blouse, skirt, stockings, and heels..."

"Can you opt out of that?" Lumian asked, keeping his laughter in check.

"No." Franca shook her head. "This must be one of Mr. Huang's rules."

After a moment of silence, she quietly asked, "Can I not go? Maybe Jenna
can apply instead."

"Do you think she'd get the job?" Lumian countered.

Franca thought for a few seconds and said, "No."

Immediately, she gnashed her teeth. "I can't let Mr. Huang harass her!"

Dechuang Garden, Building 5, 23rd floor, Room 3.

Jenna stood by the window, contemplating whether to sneak into Luo
Shan's room tonight for a more thorough search.

She hesitated for a while before deciding to wait. Luo Shan's current
state was odd, still retaining her role as the neighborhood's guardian.
Jenna worried that her actions might provoke Luo Shan, shattering that
balance and causing her to lose her protective instincts entirely.

Even though Luo Shan was merely a dream image, Jenna couldn't bring
herself to destroy the last traces of goodness within her.

That dedication to protection had touched her.

*Maybe she can still be saved? Maybe, as long as she doesn't advance
further and endure more severe pollution, she can retain her sense of
self? Hmm, having a boon from an evil god doesn't necessarily mean
turning bad, just like Lumian...* Jenna mused as these thoughts
crossed her mind.
