## Chapter 650: Reaper

In the ancient, crumbling palace of the Nation of the Evernight, Lumian
carefully poured Gardner Martin's blood into a measuring cylinder and
added the unusually sharp, small white bone blade that emitted a cold
light.

During this process, he moved swiftly, paying no attention to the
bone-blade-shaped Beyonder characteristic slicing his fingers and
causing blood to flow. Instead, he ignited crimson flames, helping the
wounds contract and preventing the white bone blade from entering the
potion with his blood.

The physical pain heightened Lumian's clarity and excitement. He added
Gardner Martin's two teeth, the Colorful Bearded Horned Lizard's venom,
and the hornbeam essential oil into the bright red blood.

*Bloop! Bloop!* Bubbles bubbled in the blood, and the items
mysteriously dissolved.

Soon, black iron dregs emerged from the bright-red blood, as if an iron
weapon had shattered inside.

Lumian glanced at the still-slumbering "Hisoka" Twanaku, picked up the
measuring cylinder, and poured the liquid into his mouth.

The pungent smell of blood, the unfamiliar taste of rust, and the
burning sensation instantly filled Lumian's mouth and pierced his brain.

It felt like being caught in a chaotic war, constantly facing blades,
firearms, and relentless enemy assaults. Wounds appeared all over his
body, throbbing with pain.

*Son of a sow, am I being attacked by a potion?* Lumian
muttered, bewildered, as he found himself locked in combat with a swarm
of oncoming adversaries.

Fireballs, Fire Ravens, and blazing white spears shattered, tore
through, or impaled the enemies, turning them into torches that
illuminated the battlefield.

After an unknown span of time, Lumian felt his strength waning, his
spiritual energy on the brink of exhaustion. The accumulated
spirituality of an Ascetic had long been unleashed.

In that moment, a colossal figure materialized before him, radiating a
formidable and intimidating aura.

Despite Lumian's weakening state, he sensed the colossal figure's fear,
hatred, and frustration.

*He's afraid of me...* Lumian realized suddenly. Summoning the
last shreds of his courage, he condensed a blazing white flaming spear
and hurled it at the colossal figure.

A blinding white flame erupted, piercing through the colossal figure's
head.

*Rumble.* The giant figure exploded from within, shattering into
countless fragments.

*Rumble.* The entire battlefield crumbled.

Lumian shook off the daze and found himself in front of a crumbling
ancient palace, its stone bricks weathered by time. Hisoka Twanaku still
slumbered, and Hela stood silently by his side.

Sweat dripped from Lumian's body, bursting into crimson sparks.

Eventually, the sweat returned to normal.

*Phew...* Lumian let out a relieved breath. His spirituality was
rapidly recovering.

He had advanced to become a Reaper.

Having completed the ritual of capturing a higher Sequence enemy alive
and revealing his conspiracy, Lumian had consumed the potion and
advanced to Sequence 5, a Reaper of the Hunter pathway.

Compared to his previous Sequences, Reaper bestowed three additional
abilities:

The first, Weakness Investigation, allowed Lumian to discern the
target's vulnerabilities and weak points in their defenses from a mystic
perspective.

The second, Cull, could be infused into any attack to harvest the
target's life. Any part struck by Cull was akin to an assault on vital
points and weaknesses, dealing significant damage.

If Cull hit a genuine weakness or vital point, it could deliver a fatal
blow, making it challenging for the target to withstand three
consecutive attacks.

It could even inflict real damage on demigod-level creatures, provided
they didn't block or successfully evade, and refrained from using mystic
defenses.

The third, Precision, enabled Lumian to precisely target a predetermined
location and manipulate fireballs, Fire Ravens, and other spells that
had left his body.

He could split a colossal fireball into hundreds, striking different
targets with precision, achieving effective area-of-effect damage.

It was a far cry from a blanket explosion, being more efficient and
effective.

Both Cull and Precision demanded a substantial amount of spirituality,
rivaling Lumian's current usage of teleportation.

The exception was the combination of Precision and Fire Raven, as Fire
Raven could allocate a bit of spirituality and was easily manipulated.
Even with Precision, its consumption of spirituality wasn't significant.

Lumian also felt a significant enhancement in his spirituality. His mind
cleared, and his life force intensified. He could compress flames to a
blazing white state in an incredibly short time, merging with flaming
spears and swiftly covering dozens to hundreds of meters. Ignoring the
spirituality consumption, he could travel using this method.

While Lumian's strength, speed, and physique had improved, he was still
not resilient enough to withstand a bullet with his body.

___

At the entrance of the mostly collapsed male bathroom in the Matani
Import and Export Shop, the silver-white full-body armor burst out,
wielding a light-condensed hammer in both hands.

It searched left and right but couldn't locate its target. Gradually, it
seemed to "calm down."

From a nearby shadow, Franca emerged, her eyes assessing Kolobo within
the half-collapsed bathroom. His life wasn't at risk, but his injuries
were significant, and he appeared weakened.

*He'll be Pride Armor's next target...* Franca thought quickly.
Seizing the moment while Pride Armor was still on the lookout for the
backstabber and hadn't chosen a new target, she swiftly approached.
Franca grabbed the motionless silver full-body armor and deftly stowed
it into her Traveler's Bag.

"Meet up with Jenna!" Franca called out to Anthony, positioned outside
the corridor.

In an instant, she melted into the shadows, disappearing from sight.

Surveying his newfound abilities, Lumian felt a surge of delight. *Is
this Reaper... If I were to confront Hisoka now, breaking through his
defenses wouldn't be a concern. My craving for combat and slaughter has
intensified...*

Having adapted to the changes in his body, Lumian turned to Hela and
expressed his gratitude.

"Thank you."

Hela, not seeing any cause for gratitude, sighed and commented, "Your
team's teamwork is impressive."

"Madame Hela, the ritual has succeeded, but I wish to enter Hisoka's
dream again and inquire about something else," Lumian requested.

Hela nodded in agreement.

"The ritual requires him to remain lucid. He might lie, but the
questioning doesn't need him to be lucid."

As she finished speaking, Lumian suddenly closed his eyes, slumping to
the ground against a dilapidated stone pillar.

The corners of his mouth remained curled up, and his expression
gradually turned calm.

In the dream's interrogation room, Lumian took a seat across from Hisoka
and addressed the captive, whose malice and desire to kill were no
longer concealed.

"Thank you for your help. I've become a Reaper."

Hisoka, leaning forward, seemed to forget that he could attack.

"So what if you're a Reaper? In a duel, I'd still kill you easily!

"If you hadn't joined forces with Hidden Blade and relied on numbers,
you would have been dead!"

*No longer lucid, he's finally revealing his true thoughts in the
dream...* Lumian chuckled and responded, "If I can create an
opportunity to fight with numbers, why should I face you one-on-one?

"My companions are also a part of my strength."

Hisoka spoke with malice, "Do you truly trust that Hypnotist?

"It's very dangerous to open up your body and mind to a Hypnotist.
Aren't you afraid that he'll take the opportunity to leave some hidden
cues that will unknowingly bring you under his control?"

Lumian gazed at Hisoka for a moment before breaking into a smile.

"Perhaps that's why I defeated you. No wonder Mad Lady said you weren't
pure enough.

"Firstly, I do trust him. We've been through life and death together.

"Secondly, I'm willing to take such a risk to kill all of you!"

Straightening up, Lumian locked eyes with Hisoka, enunciating each word,
"Even if I plunge into the Abyss, even if I descend into hell, I shall
witness your tragic demise!"

Hisoka fell silent.

Lumian eased back into his seat, composed himself, and casually
inquired, "I learned from Devilology that a Devil requires a ritual to
advance to Desire Apostle. It's best if it's a special serial killing
ritual. However, other than the one four years ago, there's only been
one in Port Pylos recently. Furthermore, I've already killed the
murderer. How did you advance?

"With a boon? You couldn't have become a Desire Apostle four years ago,
could you?"

Hisoka responded with a smile, "Just because you don't know doesn't mean
it didn't happen."

Lumian's heart stirred.

"Was one of those two pranks to cover up your advancement ritual?"

Lumian ventured, drawing from the scattered information he had gleaned
from the peripheral members of April Fool's. They were like scattered
pieces of a puzzle, each offering a fragment of the truth but lacking
the full picture.

The tales spoke of chaos unleashed: a disappearance of gold in the
depths of Devise, and a clash between townsfolk and a primitive tribe in
Tizamo Town, resulting in tragedy.

Lumian suspected that Hisoka's advancement ritual had been shrouded
within the chaos of Tizamo's prank.

Hisoka's eyes sparkled with approval, his tone paternal.

"You're quite perceptive."

Lumian seized the moment to shift the conversation.

"What's up with the Nois family's Demon?"

He treaded cautiously, sidestepping the Celestial Worthy and the Mother
Tree of Desire, for now.

Hisoka's expression turned cold.

"I aimed to utilize him to acquire something and carry out a ritual to
appease him repeatedly, but he only formed a connection with me. He only
granted me an opportunity two years ago."

*Something... Two years ago... The pranks in the gold mine city and the
town of Tizamo took place after this. One happened at the close of the
preceding year, while the other unfolded at the close of last
year...* Lumian started suspecting that these two pranks might
have motives beyond concealing the advancement ritual.

Before he could delve deeper, Hisoka asked vehemently and frenziedly,
"Why didn't you seek the Tarot Club's assistance this time?"

Lumian arched his eyebrows and inquired with confusion, "Why does it
matter to you? Even without the Tarot Club's aid, I could have
successfully dealt with you."
