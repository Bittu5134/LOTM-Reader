## Chapter 162: Fresh Corpse

Lumian crouched down, clutching the three metal canisters in his hands.
He cast a glance at Jenna, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.

"I know just the way to confirm it."

"What..." Jenna's curiosity piqued, but soon a hint of nervousness and
panic crept into her expression, triggered by Lumian's enigmatic smile.

Unfazed by her reaction, Lumian responded with a smile of his own.

"Help me determine which canister is which," he suggested.

"What sort of joke is this?" Jenna thought, grateful for the fact that
had Lumian not saved her and aware of her own weakened state, she would
have unleashed a stream of curses.

However, Lumian's expression turned serious.

"Rest assured, if it contains the gas that knocks you out, the worst
that can happen is you fainting again. I won't harm you, and even if I
wanted to, you wouldn't be able to resist. Besides, once we ascertain
which canister is which, I can use a stimulating gas to revive you and
bring you back to normal."

"If luck is on your side and you encounter the stimulating gas, you'll
regain most of your strength immediately," Lumian added.

*That makes sense. Regardless of the outcome, it can't possibly be
harmful.* She was almost convinced by Lumian's words.

However, snapping out of her daze, Jenna clenched her teeth and voiced
her concerns.

"But what if you end up selecting the other canister? We have no idea
what it contains!"

If it turned out to be poisonous gas, there was no one present with the
knowledge to treat her.

Lumian responded with a mocking tone, a smile still tugging at the
corners of his mouth, "Are you daft? Canisters filled mostly with gas
and those containing liquid have a significant weight difference!"

"This particular bottle should be filled with liquid!"

He picked up one of the metal canisters and gave it a slight shake.

He "clearly" heard the unmistakable sloshing sound of liquid inside
before pocketing it.

"Is that so..." Although Jenna had been mocked, her attention was
focused on the "experiment," and anger didn't consume her.

After a few seconds of hesitation, she closed her eyes and tilted her
head slightly, determined.

"Go ahead, give it a try!"

Lumian stowed one of the metal bottles in his pants pocket, leaving only
one in his grasp.

With a leisurely pace, he brought it near Jenna's nose.

In the next moment, Jenna slowly cracked open her eyes.

Lumian chuckled, twisting open the cap.

In an instant, an intensely pungent odor, reminiscent of fermented
excrement, assailed Jenna's senses, causing her to sneeze repeatedly.
Tears threatened to spill from her eyes, and her nose threatened to
drip.

However, each sneeze served as a catalyst, restoring a significant
portion of her strength. As Lumian sealed the canister and rose from his
crouch, Jenna leaped to her feet, instinctively stretching her limbs.

Jenna happily adjusted her clothing and skirt, muttering to herself,
"Seems like luck is on my side!"

On her first attempt, she managed to obtain the canister with the
foul-smelling gas.

But then she noticed Lumian's playful expression.

Jenna's heart skipped a beat, sensing that something was off.

Curiosity getting the better of her, she inquired, "Did you already know
which gas canister was which from the start?"

*Is that the reason he was able to accurately select the metal canister
containing the pungent gas?*

Lumian grinned and handed the metal canister to Jenna.

"Smell the cap for yourself."

Jenna eyed the canister suspiciously before cautiously sniffing the
bottle.

A faint odor lingered, not particularly stimulating or potent, but still
unpleasant.

"The other canister has no scent," Lumian added with a smile.

Jenna's flushed face turned an even deeper shade of red.

She felt foolish, having believed the words of the other party and
willingly taken part in the so-called "experiment."

Any feelings of gratitude she had prepared were instantly quashed.

Ignoring Jenna's enraged state, Lumian pocketed the 8 verl d'or banknote
and marked the metal canister with a scratch before stowing it away.

Though the man possessed the ability to sense the whereabouts of items
that had once belonged to him, Lumian wasn't afraid of being tracked
since the man was already dead.

As for the function of the liquid in the remaining metal canister, he
planned to test it on rats, stray dogs, and other animals.

Having completed the necessary tasks, Lumian pointed at the pervert's
lifeless body and instructed Jenna, "Take a good look at him and commit
his face to memory. We'll need to investigate who he is."

"He probably has accomplices."

"Alright." Jenna strode toward the corpse, earnestly engraving his face
into her memory.

After observing for a while, the recent events flooded back into her
mind, fueling her anger. She raised her right leg and ruthlessly kicked
the pervert's groin.

Again and again, without restraint.

"Dogshit, pervert, damn your mother, damn your entire family!" Jenna
vented her emotions to her heart's content.

Lumian winced, feeling a twinge of pain, as he lowered his head to clean
up the remnants at the scene.

Once Jenna had calmed down, he approached her with a large grayish-white
cloth bag. As he stuffed the corpse and clothes inside, he casually
inquired, "How did he abduct you?"

Jenna smoothed her disheveled brownish-yellow hair and tied it back into
a simple ponytail.

Gritting her teeth, she recounted, "I encountered him in an alley next
to the Salle de Bal Brise. He claimed to be a fan of my singing and
asked for an autograph. The paper he handed me was sprinkled with that
odorless gas. As soon as I signed it, I sensed something was wrong and
lost most of my strength.

"After that, he attacked me, restrained me, and brought the bottle to my
nose. That's when I passed out."

Lumian couldn't help but mock, "Aren't you being too careless?"

Jenna didn't agree.

"I've seen him several times while singing. I was certain that he
genuinely enjoyed listening to me. Otherwise, I wouldn't have given him
the time of day.

"And, as an unknown singer, it's an honor to have someone ask for your
autograph...

"Besides, the gas doesn't have any smell!"

How could anyone have guarded against this?

Lumian scoffed.

"That's not what I meant. It's obvious that the gas dissipates quickly
on paper. It needs to be used within a short period of time to have a
certain effect. In other words, that pervert has been tailing you for a
while and has probably figured out your routines. Otherwise, he wouldn't
have cornered you so accurately in an empty alley and tainted the paper
with the gas ten to twenty seconds in advance.

"Didn't you notice despite being followed for so long?"

Jenna fell silent, at times clenching her teeth, at times frustrated.

Lumian shifted his gaze and chuckled.

It was understandable that she didn't notice. That guy could discern
hormonal information from different individuals.

If it weren't for the fact that Monsieur Ive was clearly weaker than the
pervert and probably hadn't mastered the power of lust, Lumian would
have suspected that his identity as a "robber" had been exposed.

He resealed the grayish-white cloth bag and used it to further erase any
traces at the scene. Observing this, Jenna lent him a hand.

*She's quite skilled at dealing with evidence...* Lumian glanced
at Jenna and left the cave with the cloth bag slung over his back,
harboring some suspicions.

Due to Jenna intentionally not mentioning her unusual behavior under the
influence of the pervert, Lumian believed that this Showy Diva had some
understanding of the Beyonder world, or she might even be one herself.

And her source of information or power most likely stemmed from "Red
Boots" Franca from the Savoie Mob.

When Lumian arrived at his hiding spot, he ignited the carbide lamp and
held it in his hand, glancing back at the depths of the path.

The path descended. There was darkness in the distance,

a void that swallowed everything as it lay in wait for its prey to
approach.

"What are you looking at?" Jenna asked curiously.

She sensed that Ciel was acting mysterious.

Lumian ended his gaze and smiled.

"I'm wondering where we'll end up if we keep going down. Perhaps the
Trier from the Fourth Epoch?"

In reality, what he was truly pondering was:

*The abnormal ability displayed just now was strikingly similar to
Monsieur Ive's. If the two of them were accomplices, would they
instinctively choose a familiar place in the underground world for the
crime? The same underground destination where Monsieur Ive had entered
that night?*

If that were the case, perhaps he would uncover something if he
continued down this path.

Disappointed, Jenna remarked, "That's not a good place."

Lumian remained silent as he retraced his steps along the path. Lost in
her own thoughts, Jenna followed silently, clutching the carbide lamp
left behind by the pervert.

Just as he was about to reach the level that roughly replicated the
layout aboveground, Lumian halted and said with a contemptuous smile,
"Do you need me to escort you to the surface?"

"You're not going back?" Jenna asked, surprised.

Lumian shrugged. "I need to find a suitable place to dispose of this
corpse."

Jenna nodded and refrained from prying further. "I can ascend on my own.
I've been underground before."

*Does that imply you possess the means to protect yourself?
*Lumian watched Jenna depart with light footsteps, inwardly
sighing.

*Does every human and dog in Trier have access to Beyonder
powers?*

*Is something amiss with Trier, or is something amiss with me? Why do I
always encounter such individuals?*

Shaking his head, he hoisted the corpse onto his back. As he dealt with
the footprints, he made his way toward the hidden quarry cave where he
had previously sought the boon.

Along the way, he performed two instances of anti-tracking to ensure no
one was tailing him.

Upon reaching the underground quarry cave, Lumian tossed aside the
grayish-white cloth bag containing the corpse and arranged the altar.

Initially, he had intended to visit the nearest hospital morgue during
the night to acquire fresh corpses, but now he had a better option!

After setting up the altar, lighting the candles, and constructing a
wall of spirituality, Lumian retrieved the pre-drawn faux goatskin
adorned with the corresponding symbol.

The central pattern on the paper consisted of a ring formed by thorns,
encircled by symbols representing eyes, curves, and rivers.

Just tracing these patterns in Room 207 had drained Lumian's
spirituality.

With the faux goatskin in place, Lumian took two steps back and gazed at
the flickering candles, preparing for the subsequent incantation.

In this ritual, one couldn't employ the phrase "I! I summon in my name"
to beseech oneself. Instead, they had to craft a three-line description
of their being and feign the role of a creature from the spirit world.

It could be done in any manner, devoid of any wielding of authority, as
long as it could pinpoint the location within the wall of spirituality.

Lumian parted his lips and muttered in Hermes, "Cordu Village's
Trickster King, Aurore Lee's younger brother, an entity known as Lumian
Lee..."
