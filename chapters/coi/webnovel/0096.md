## Chapter 96: Prey and Hunter

The flaming monster pursued relentlessly, hurling crimson fireballs that
blasted craters in the earth. Lumian was thrown off balance multiple
times.

Flames licked at the charred logs that littered the desolate landscape,
casting flickering red light in every direction.

Lumian barely spared a thought for the fire still consuming his clothes.
Gritting his teeth against the searing pain, he was sent sprawling by
the shockwaves of detonation after detonation. He staggered to his feet
and careened wildly towards his destination---veering left, then right,
arcing and darting straight ahead.

Mercifully, he didn't have far to go based on his plan. Just as he felt
the taste of blood in his mouth and his body threatened to give out, a
dilapidated building loomed before him.

*Boom!*

Lumian contorted his body mid-stride, narrowly avoiding a fireball. The
scarlet projectile exploded just ahead, unleashing a hellish maelstrom
of flames.

Seizing the moment, Lumian dropped to the ground and rolled beneath the
worst of the conflagration. With the momentum, he tumbled into the
partially collapsed structure.

The flaming monster halted and hesitated, wary of pursuing its prey into
a potential death trap.

It watched as Lumian rolled deeper into the building, summoning a swarm
of red Fire Ravens around it.

Their screeches filled the air as they took flight. Half of them dove
towards the building's support beams, while the others bore down on
Lumian from all sides.

These avian flames were unerring, constantly adjusting their
trajectories to match Lumian's movements.

In that instant, the flaming monster could almost see its enemy's
charred remains.

Fire Ravens were far more difficult to dodge than mere fireballs!

And then, Lumian disappeared from the monster's view.

He had rolled into a well-preserved basement.

*Bang!*

Lumian slammed the wooden door shut and leaped aside, using the force of
the impact.

*Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!* The scarlet Fire Ravens slammed into
the door.

*Boom!*

The heavy door disintegrated into flaming splinters.

*Rumble!*

The remaining Fire Ravens struck their intended targets, bringing down
the decaying structure in a torrent of debris.

Stone, wood, and dust engulfed the area, entombing the basement.

Lumian had already taken refuge in a corner, using the accumulated dirt
to smother the flames that clung to him.

But he was still badly burned, his internal organs battered by the force
of the explosions. Without swift medical attention, he wouldn't last
another day.

The flaming monster's attack had been devastating, even more potent than
Ryan sans his Hurricane of Light!

Lumian had intended to use Invisibility to elude the flaming monster,
slipping into the basement to perform his enigmatic sacrificial dance,
activating the black thorn symbol on his chest to terrify his foe. He'd
planned to bide his time for Fallen Mercury to complete the exchange of
fate. But the persistent fire had thwarted his Invisibility, nearly
costing him his life.

The one consolation was that he had a backup plan in the event he
couldn't escape the monster's pursuit, nor could he perform his
sacrificial dance in peace.

He'd even considered collapsing the building to bury the basement and
buy time, but the flaming monster had done the job for him.

*Phew...* Exhaling deeply, Lumian sat cross-legged.

He retrieved the bottle of gray amber perfume from Aurore, unscrewed the
cap, and placed it before him.

Outside the demolished building, the flaming monster's gaze cut through
the swirling dust, searching for any trace of its quarry.

It was certain that the cunning intruder wouldn't have been buried alive
so easily.

Given the complexity of the traps he'd laid and his intimate knowledge
of the ruins, he must have left himself an escape route!

The flaming monster wasn't particularly intelligent, but its Hunter's
instincts led it to circle the collapsed building.

In less than ten seconds, it discovered a hidden cave entrance angling
downward.

The opening was concealed by debris from the fallen structure, sheltered
from the ensuing collapse. It was difficult to spot and tucked away in a
discreet location.

The monster raised its right hand, conjuring a fist-sized white fireball
in its palm.

With a sudden lunge, it hurled the fireball down the passageway.

The flames streaked through the air, penetrated the basement, and
collided with the far wall.

*Boom!*

The blast wave didn't affect Lumian, who was deliberately hiding in
another corner. It only overturned the bottle of gray amber perfume in
front of him and quaked the entire basement.

The gurgle of liquid flowed from the open bottle, its elegant and sweet
fragrance intensifying instantly.

Lumian leaned against the wall, eyes closed, lost in Cogitation.

His mind conjured a crimson sun, holding it steady for a few seconds.

Suddenly, a terrifying sound reached Lumian's ears, as if from an
infinite distance yet unnervingly close.

Blue veins bulged across his face, hands, and neck, quickly turning red.

Simultaneously, silver-black spots seeped from his skin.

He opened his mouth to scream, but collapsed and curled up before a
sound could escape.

Fallen Mercury slipped from Lumian's left palm, but it dared not make a
move. It didn't even attempt to approach his exposed face or right hand
to create a marionette through contact.

It just quivered there, violently.

Outside the basement, the monster poised to conjure a fireball froze
beside the entrance Lumian had excavated.

It couldn't help but shudder.

A few seconds later, it fled, abandoning the hunt.

Lumian plunged into a darkness teeming with flickering flames. His mind
was overwhelmed with excruciating pain and malevolent thoughts.

In that moment, death seemed preferable. He sensed something deep within
him rapidly growing and taking form.

It appeared to be a trauma---composed of all negative personalities and
a particular will. Once assembled into human shape, it would utterly
supplant the original him.

Amid the unending darkness of despair and pain, Lumian caught a whiff of
a scent.

Elegant and sweet.

It was Aurore's fragrance, a familiar aroma.

*Aurore... Grande Soeur...* Lumian slowly regained his
composure, as if hearing the comforting melody once more.

*I want to live!*

*The loop hasn't ended yet!*

†

A rush of thoughts flooded back to him. Lumian finally vanquished the
pitch-black will and the agony-laced darkness within his heart and
opened his eyes.

The first thing in his sight was the toppled bottle of gray amber
perfume on the ground.

*It toppled? *Lumian's heart ached as he reached out his right
hand.

Initially, he'd only intended to mimic Aurore's use of incense to
control his symptoms and rely on the natural perfume as a wake-up call.
Unexpectedly, more than half the bottle had spilled.

In the next instant, his body quivered. He saw the charred, bloodstained
back of his hand and the silver-black circular spots that had yet to
fade.

Without needing a reminder, Lumian could "smell" the unfamiliar,
hair-raising scent on himself.

If he crossed paths with Valentine now, he'd be "purified" by his Holy
Light Summoning without revealing a thing.

Lumian scooped up the remaining half of the gray amber perfume,
tightened the cap, and stowed it away.

He then picked up Fallen Mercury, still trembling violently, and asked
in Hermes, "Is the fate exchange over?"

Fallen Mercury swiftly shook left and right, signaling it wasn't.

Lumian exhaled in relief.

He feared that by the time he awoke, the fate exchange would've been
completed---the shock would last no more than a minute.

If he couldn't locate the flaming monster in time, his recent torment
would be futile.

*Breathe in, breathe out...* Lumian adjusted his dreadful
condition and mustered his remaining strength before crawling out of the
basement through the hole he had dug earlier.

Each motion tugged at various wounds, making him wince in pain.

Upon exiting the basement, Lumian searched for the flaming monster's
tracks and sighed inwardly.

*Using Cogitation in such a state and fully activating the thorn symbol
on my chest is downright suicidal...*

*I haven't done it since becoming a Hunter, barely repressing the
symptoms with gray amber's scent. Had I done it a few times before, my
body might have mutated slightly, turning me into a monster...*

*I can't risk this for a while unless I have a death wish...*

He opted for Cogitation to fully activate the black thorn symbol on his
chest rather than the sacrificial dance's partial activation, as time
was of the essence and he couldn't perform the dance.

With Cogitation, he could frighten off the flaming monster in five or
six seconds. The enigmatic sacrificial dance, however, took 30 to 40
seconds---even with his familiarity.

In Lumian's hunting strategy, this was his last resort. If he couldn't
evade the flaming monster's pursuit by other means, he'd attempt
Cogitation!

Lumian hadn't anticipated that Cogitation would leave him gravely
injured from the start and on the brink of losing control, turning into
a monster.

Before long, Lumian discovered the flaming monster's tracks and pursued
them.

A few minutes later, the prints appeared fresher, so he slowed his pace.

Soon after, Fallen Mercury shuddered on its own, notifying Lumian that
the fate exchange was complete.

Without hesitation, Lumian brandished the iron-black axe and charged
forward, following the flaming monster's footprints.

In under twenty seconds, he spotted the scorched and smoldering prey.

It cowered in a rock-encircled corner, quaking.

Lumian dashed over, cast aside Fallen Mercury, and seized the axe with
both hands, cleaving down with all his might.

With a dull thud, the flaming monster's head and body separated.

Bright red blood spurted out violently, igniting into scarlet flame
clusters on the ground.

Lumian, unable to hold on any longer, collapsed to the ground with his
axe.
