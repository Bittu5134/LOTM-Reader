## Chapter 582: Efficient Person-Locator

Port Santa, in the city.

Loki and the unconscious Ludwig had already sought refuge in an
apartment that Loki had rented many days earlier. He began manipulating
the sealed demigod's Spirit Body Threads.

As for his two marionettes, they lurked within a radius of 100 to 200
meters, with Loki as the center, blending in with the various
celebrating and passing crowds. They waited to be discovered by Lumian
Lee's teammates and the clergyman of the Church of Earth Mother.

This was unavoidable. A Marionettist couldn't allow a marionette to
wield their Faceless powers. As for the mystical item of the Seer
pathway, it was in the possession of either Bard or Mad Lady.

In the partially destroyed suite of Solow Motel, Jenna and Anthony
encountered Noelia, the combat nun, and her teammates, who had hurried
over.

Before this, Lumian had covertly introduced the disguised Jenna and
Anthony to Noelia. Hence, the nuns didn't unnecessarily question or
apprehend them; they only carefully confirmed each other's identities.

"Rubió Paco is a fake. He's disguised by a Marionettist. He has captured
Louis Berry's godson. He possesses two marionettes. One is Madame
Martha, the Paco family's matriarch. The other's identity and abilities
are unknown," Jenna recounted the recent events.

She assumed that the Fertility Order was familiar with the term
Marionettist and didn't delve into unnecessary explanations. Their
primary duty was to guard against the Intis Republic to the north, and
many official Beyonders of Bureau 8 in the Intis Republic belonged to
the Seer pathway. The two sides must have had considerable interactions.

*Marionettist...* Indeed, upon hearing the Sequence name, Noelia
frowned slightly. Is Intis sending spies to disrupt the sea prayer
ritual?

"That's a traitor from Intis's Bureau 8," Jenna explained, her
allegiance to Intis stronger than Lumian's.

Noelia understood that time was of the essence and she couldn't discuss
unrelated matters. She asked the key question, "Why seize Louis Berry's
godson? Is he held as a hostage, or does he possess some extraordinary
significance?"

Jenna thought for a moment and revealed the limited information she had
just learned.

"It's a sealed demigod, a creature.

"Loki will need substantial time to transform him into a marionette, not
just a matter of minutes."

*A demigod? A sealed demigod? That child with the insatiable appetite is
a sealed demigod?* Noelia's mouth hung open in surprise and
astonishment. She almost questioned the reliability of her own ears.

*The supposed godson of the adventurer Louis Berry is, in fact, a sealed
demigod creature?*

*What's his backstory? Why is he wandering around with a sealed demigod
creature?*

*Moreover, there's talk of a humanoid Sealed Artifact, rumored to be at
Grade 1, that recently surfaced in Port Santa. It's on par with a sealed
demigod creature. Despite extensive searching, no one has been able to
locate it.*

If not for the disparities in appearance, gender, and age, Noelia might
have suspected Ludwig to be the humanoid Sealed Artifact that the
Eternal Blazing Sun Church had "misplaced."

Now, an absurd idea echoed in her mind.

*Is it the current trend to stroll around with sealed demigod
creatures?*

Regaining her composure, Noelia promptly addressed her team members,
"Cemilie, quickly return to the Order and inform the dean. Ask her to
deploy all available personnel to the city. Locate them as soon as
possible. Yes, Madam Martha or Louis Berry's godson, Ludwig.

"After finding them, unless the situation is exceptionally urgent,
refrain from acting recklessly. Report first and await assistance."

Considering that the Marionettist had likely altered his appearance and
height, and the identity and appearance of his other marionette were
unknown, Noelia concentrated her search on Madam Martha, who had become
a marionette, and Ludwig, who had been abducted.

"Yes, Captain!" In a bid to save time, the brown-haired Cemilie darted
through the shattered glass window. Utilizing the stone bricks and wood
protruding from the outer wall, she leaped from the fifth floor to the
street.

The dean Noelia referred to was the head of the local cloister, the
clergyman overseeing the Fertility Order in Port Santa---the Fertility
Order's headquarters in Torres, the capital of Gaia Province.

Just as Cemilie took a few steps and was about to explore the nearby
streets, Jenna, Anthony, Noelia, and the others witnessed a massive bird
soaring through the air.

The bird's body was grayish-black, its feathers were tough and lacked
softness. Its eyes appeared to be adorned with two rubies.

The grayish-black bird flapped its wings and glided to the collapsed
fifth-floor outer wall of Solow Motel.

Only then did Jenna and Anthony realize that the grayish-black bird was
sculpted from stone. It was weighty, substantial, and unyielding, yet it
emanated a vibrant vitality.

Perched on the back of the lifelike grayish-black bird was a woman in a
brown clergyman's robe. She wore a nun's wimple with wheat patterns and
seemed to be in her thirties, but she exuded a maternal aura, as if she
had nurtured many children.

The brown-haired, brown-eyed, mature, and stunning clergyman turned her
gaze to Noelia and succinctly stated, "Details."

Noelia swiftly echoed Jenna's words. She positioned herself with a
slight spread of her legs and raised her hands.

"Praise the Earth, praise the Mother of All Things!"

The clergyman was none other than the archbishop of the Church of Earth
Mother's Gaia diocese, Agrippina.

Agrippina nodded gently and uttered, "I know Martha from the Paco
family. I didn't expect her to meet such a fate. Sigh, may the Earth
Mother embrace her soul, and may the flower symbolizing her bloom again
next spring."

The archbishop delicately shifted her right foot, conveying a signal to
the massive bird sculpted from grayish-black stone.

The stone bird, pulsating with vitality, flapped its wings and ascended
dozens of meters into the air.

Agrippina extended her right hand and scattered a handful of dark-black
seeds the size of rice grains.

With a flutter, the port's white-headed seabirds flocked in, covering
the sky. Each one gripped a seed in its beak and circled around.

They formed a circle within a 300-meter radius.

Observing this spectacle, the jubilant citizens of Port Santa, assuming
that the seabirds had joined in the celebration of the successful sea
prayer ritual, erupted in cheers of delight.

After two to three minutes, a solitary combat nun spotted Madam Martha.
The marionette was concealed on the other side of Aquina Street.

Upon receiving the information, Agrippina turned her head and fixed her
gaze into the air.

Soon, the white-headed seabirds released the rice-sized seeds from their
beaks.

Agrippina withdrew her gaze and folded her arms across her chest.

Each seed that touched the ground instantly sprouted and grew rapidly,
morphing into thick dark-green vines.

Simultaneously, Jenna, Anthony, Noelia, and the others, who were
scouring the street for Ludwig and Loki, witnessed the sky darken, as if
night had prematurely descended or a colossal creature had eclipsed the
sunlight.

Vaguely, they sensed the presence of a massive pitch-black wing covered
in a membrane, casting an illusory aura.

In the next moment, a crimson full moon ascended from the night, hanging
high in the sky. It seemed as though a tall, slender figure was slowly
advancing.

Crimson moonlight bathed the area surrounded by the dark-green vines,
captivating all the citizens like statues.

Nourished by the moonlight, the dark-green vines swiftly expanded,
swiftly encasing the streets around Aquina Street in a "forest."

Dark-red flowers blossomed in the "forest," densely clustered and
ubiquitous.

The flowers emitted a faint, sweet fragrance that intermingled,
gradually intensifying the scent.

Upon inhaling this fragrance, the residents of Port Santa, as well as
the rats and bedbugs in the corresponding area, entered a stupor,
swaying and collapsing to the ground.

Dammit! Jenna understood that Archbishop Agrippina of the Church of
Earth Mother was employing indiscriminate tactics to influence the area,
aiming to locate and control Loki, but she still cursed internally.

This gaseous anesthetic jogged unpleasant memories.

In the past, she had nearly fallen victim to a similar gas used by that
Bliss Society pervert.

Yet now, in the diffusing gas with a noticeable difference in smell but
a similar effect, her head started to spin, and her body felt uneasy.

The same was true for Anthony and Noelia. One bore dragon-like scales on
his skin, while the other held her breath.

At that moment, three white-headed seabirds descended from the sky, each
clutching a metallic bottle, circling Jenna and the others.

Noelia glanced at Archbishop Agrippina, who was hovering in midair, and
received a nod. Without hesitation, she took the bottle from a
white-headed seabird's claw and gulped it down.

She swiftly regained consciousness, no longer affected by the gaseous
anesthetic.

Observing this, Jenna and Anthony accepted the metal bottles and
consumed the sour agent.

They no longer felt dizzy and weak.

The three white-headed seabirds weakly ascended again, landing by the
roadside one after another, and dozed off.

In the area surrounded by the dark-green vine "forest," only a
marionette remained standing at that moment, impervious to the gaseous
anesthetic. Its presence was immediately exposed.

In the apartment he had pre-rented, Loki was taken aback to discover
that controlling the sealed demigod's Spirit Body Threads was much more
challenging than he had anticipated.

This wasn't a problem that could be resolved in ten minutes. According
to his initial estimate, it would take at least an hour!

Given the time, the Church of Earth Mother could turn these streets
upside down!

As the gaseous anesthetic created by the dark-green vines and dark-red
flowers permeated the room, Loki's initial impulse was to craft an air
straw nearly 30 meters long and extend it high into the air to breathe
fresh air. However, he quickly dismissed the idea.

Perhaps the demigod of the Church of Earth Mother was waiting to detect
similar traces to pinpoint his location!

Moreover, Loki had realized that there was more than one demigod in the
sky!

If there was only one, he could rely on Sealed Artifacts, bestowments,
and other means to concentrate. He could conceal himself in the shadows
and contend with them to see if he could endure until the
marionette-making process was completed. However, there were at least
two demigods observing.

More importantly, he could endure for about ten minutes, but an hour was
out of the question!

After weighing the pros and cons, Loki abandoned his original plan to
conduct the ritual today and advance to Sequence 4 Bizarro Sorcerer.

In any case, as long as he could restrain the sealed demigod, he could
find another opportunity in the future. There was no need for him to
perform today!

*Why would it take an hour or more? Is this a demigod's Spirit Body
Threads?* Amidst Loki's confusion, he didn't intend to recall
the two marionettes. He planned on using the mystical item to "teleport"
away.

From his pocket, he retrieved a bracelet made of different-colored gems.

Just as Loki was about to activate a diamond, he heard the sound of
swallowing.

Loki instinctively lowered his head and looked into his arms, realizing
that Ludwig had awakened at some point.

With a sincere expression, the boy spoke with a hint of eagerness, "I'm
hungry..."
