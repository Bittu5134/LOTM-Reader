## Chapter 694: A "Deal"

*The Dream Festival came to an abrupt end?* Lumian jolted
upright, realizing he was holding the strange golden mask he had
received from Hisoka.

For a moment, he couldn't tell if he was still dreaming or if the mask
had somehow followed him from the dream into the waking world.

Lumian turned to look behind him.

Reaza and Maslow, who had died during the Dream Festival, were lying in
the middle of the street, just starting to regain consciousness.

Taking advantage of the moment while they gathered their wits and slowly
got to their feet, Lumian focused his attention on their luck.

He could see clear signs of death on both of them. Their fates were
about to undergo a rapid transformation, irreversibly tainted by
darkness.

Reaza's luck, in particular, was changing even more swiftly and
dramatically, like a river suddenly plunging over a cliff to form a
waterfall.

At that instant, Reaza remembered what had happened to him during the
Dream Festival. Uncontrollable fear washed over his pale, cold face.

*Pop, pop, pop.* Huge, mucus-oozing warts erupted all over his
body, just as Lumian had witnessed in the dream.

Seeing Reaza's eyes turn frenzied and his body start to disintegrate,
Lumian raised his free right hand, pointing it at Reaza's mouth as if it
were a gun.

A condensed bullet of blazing white flame shot from Lumian's fingertip,
shattering Reaza's teeth as it entered his mouth.

*Boom!*

Reaza's head split apart inch by inch, engulfed in roaring flames.

The vice-captain of Port Pylos's patrol team collapsed heavily, his body
covered in a thin black suit made up of countless slimy warts.

Lumian turned to Maslow, who was shocked by Reaza's grotesque
transformation and terrified by the death he had experienced in the
dream. Calmly, Lumian asked, "Who was he working for?"

As he spoke, Lumian tucked the golden mask into his Traveler's Bag and
checked to make sure the Symphony of Hatred and his other belongings
were still there.

Everything was accounted for, including the food he had thrown at
Ludwig.

Maslow paused for a few seconds before answering, "We're all part of the
Numinous Episcopate."

*Numinous Episcopate...* Lumian chuckled. "Do you still believe
in Death?"

*Wasn't Death already dead?*

Maslow considered the question for a moment before saying, "Reaza told
me that Death is on the verge of returning. There have been signs
recently that prayers are being answered again."

Hearing Maslow's words, Lumian nodded pensively.

"Which faction of the Numinous Episcopate do you belong to?"

As far as he knew, the Numinous Episcopate was divided into numerous
factions. There were the Royals, led by the descendants of the Eggers
family, who sought to restore the Balam Empire's rule; the Artificial
Death faction, which had somehow recreated Death itself; and the less
influential Repose and Underworld factions.

"We're from the Royal faction," Maslow admitted.

"Did you infiltrate the patrol team on purpose?" Lumian asked
nonchalantly.

Maslow shook his head.

"No, Admiral Querarill has been secretly working with us."

*Admiral Querarill, the de facto ruler of Matani, is closely tied to the
Numinous Episcopate's Royal faction... Combined with the Church of Earth
Mother and the remaining Intis faction, this must be what Franca meant
by dancing on three eggs. Judging by the situation, Reaza wasn't a
traitor after all... It's no wonder Admiral Querarill didn't send
backup. If the Numinous Episcopate and the Church of The Fool can't
handle the problem, it won't matter how many people he sends...*
His mind now clear, Lumian asked, "Was participating in this Dream
Festival a direct order from the Royal faction's upper ranks?"

"Yes." Maslow glanced at Reaza's body, now unrecognizable as human, and
said, "Apparently the order came straight from the Empress."

*Empress... The Pale Empress of the Numinous Episcopate's Royal
faction?* Lumian instinctively scanned his surroundings.

A sudden thought struck him. He drew the straight sword he had bought in
Port Santa, picked up Reaza's clothes, and quickly searched through the
items he had left behind.

There was no sign of the death-corroded golden mask or the crystal-like
skull.

Even though the skull had turned into a goat in the dream and the golden
mask had sunk into the tranquil river, Lumian reasoned that it had still
been a dream, after all. No matter how unusual it was, it was ultimately
just a dream. When someone died, they died in reality, but the same
might not hold true for objects. It was similar to how some of the food
Ludwig had eaten in the dream had reappeared in the Traveler's Bag.

Even if the items were going to disappear, it would have to happen
later. For now, they should definitely return to the real world!

However, Reaza had nothing on him.

A chill ran down Lumian's spine. Lowering his voice, he asked,
"Termiboros, did you notice anything?"

Termiboros's majestic voice echoed in Lumian's ears."Do you only now
know fear?"

"Tch." Lumian felt a lingering sense of dread, but he didn't let it
show. "Was the Pale Empress watching?"

Termiboros replied in a deep tone, *"It's not just Her."*

*Her? The Pale Empress is an Angel?* Lumian composed himself and
turned his attention back to Maslow.

Just as Maslow was wondering why Louis Berry was talking to himself, the
other party suddenly asked, "Why did Reaza kill you?"

Maslow stayed quiet, offering no response.

Lumian chuckled. "Did you betray him?"

Maslow's lips trembled, but he didn't say a word.

Lumian smiled casually and said, "It doesn't matter. If you don't want
to answer, don't. You won't be alive much longer anyway."

Maslow's face turned ashen as he considered the ramifications of his
death during the Dream Festival.

Lumian nodded, then added, "Go on and do whatever you want. Just don't
do anything bad. It'll make you die sooner."

With that, Lumian glanced at Reaza's corpse, which was starting to
produce the Beyonder characteristic. Greed welled up inside him, but he
suppressed it with an Ascetic's self-control.

He decided that regardless of whether Reaza had been a traitor or not,
his Beyonder characteristics should be left for Camus and the Matani
patrol team.

To stop himself from giving in to greed and with a grave matter coming
to mind, Lumian's expression shifted subtly. He activated the black mark
on his right shoulder and teleported away.

Maslow stared at the street that had been empty a moment before and the
lights that had been stirred by the explosion, looking as though his
soul had left his body. With a dazed and despondent expression, he
turned and walked toward the forest outside Tizamo.

†

In the second-floor suite of the Brieu Motel.

The instant Lugano woke up, he noticed he couldn't move his right
forearm.

*It's okay, it's okay. I'll be fine after a psychiatric treatment or
two. The people in Tizamo can be healed by Mass without needing Beyonder
effects...* Lugano tried to console himself as he endured the
pain in his right forearm.

Just then, he heard hurried footsteps coming from the living room
outside his door.

*Crack!*

The door to Lugano's bedroom flew open. In the crimson moonlight pouring
through the window, Ludwig appeared, dressed in blue pajamas with yellow
stars and a matching nightcap. He was clutching a half-withered,
blood-stained, dark red heart.

*Badump! Badump!*

Lugano could hear his own heart pounding, and he felt like his soul was
about to abandon his body out of sheer terror.

Had Ludwig come back for seconds because he had woken up early and
hadn't gotten his fill during the dream?

A moment later, Lugano saw a figure float in through the doorway.

The figure was semi-transparent, wearing an elaborate, opulent, black
dress. There was no head on its neck, just a clean cut. In its hand, it
held four identical blonde heads with red eyes and beautiful features.

"Return..." "It"... "To"... "Me"...

The four heads uttered different words in ancient Feysac, forming a
complete sentence.

Ludwig's image was reflected in their eight crimson eyes.

"Mine!" Ludwig ran to Lugano's bed and spun around, looking like he
wanted to bring the heart to his mouth, but he seemed to hesitate.

The four heads held by the translucent figure spoke one by one,
"Idiot"... "Eating"... "Your"... "Own"... "Brain"...

"That"... "Is"... "My"... "Heart"...

"If"... "You"... "Don't"... "Return"...

"I"... "Will"... "Turn"... "You"... "Into"... "Pig"...

Almost at the same moment, Lumian materialized next to Ludwig, taking in
the scene and hearing the corresponding words.

Lumian glanced at the strange-looking lady, then at Ludwig, who wore a
resolute expression as if he would defend his food to the death. After a
moment's consideration, Lumian said,

"Madam, perhaps you could try trading him other spiritually rich
materials for it."

In Ludwig's current state, Lumian didn't dare try to take the item from
him by force.

The lady in the intricate black dress, holding four blonde, red-eyed
heads, went silent.

After a short while, one of her heads spat out a gleaming gold coin and
held it between its teeth.

*A gold coin? You want to buy it with a gold coin? Ludwig doesn't care
about money...* Lumian was about to point this out to the lady
when he suddenly realized the gold coin looked familiar.

It was a Loen gold coin, worth 1 pound.

*Uh...* Lumian glanced over at Ludwig.

Ludwig wavered.

After a few seconds, he finally held out his hands and gave the
half-withered dark red heart to the woman's head.

The blonde, red-eyed head let go, dropping the gold coin into Ludwig's
hand. Quickly, it sank its teeth into the half-withered dark red heart.

The translucent lady stepped back and vanished from Lugano's bedroom.

Ludwig hastily popped the Loen gold coin into his mouth, as if trying to
hide it in his stomach. But then he seemed to think better of it and
fished it back out. He wiped it off on his pajamas and carefully put it
in his pocket.

*Just as I thought, it's the same as Jenna's lucky gold coin... A Loen
gold coin closely connected to Mr. Fool?* Lumian nodded to
himself, comprehension dawning.

A twinge of disappointment ran through him.

*Two people close to me have gotten lucky gold coins. Why don't I have
one?*
