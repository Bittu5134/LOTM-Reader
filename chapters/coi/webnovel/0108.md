## Chapter 108: Report

Several days later, an investigation report on Cordu Village was
submitted to Intis Intelligence and Homeland Security Committee's Bureau
8, the Machinery Hivemind of the Church of the God of Steam and
Machinery, and the Eternal Blazing Sun Church's Inquisition.

Upon receipt, the brass immediately reviewed the report.

*Background: Over the past year, numerous disappearances have occurred
in the Feynapotter Kingdom's Grabaka Province, near the Dariège region,
and in the Lenburg Republic's Upper Hel state. Several Beyonders without
official permission have mysteriously vanished, and these incidents seem
to be connected to shepherds traveling across the three regions. Among
them, those from Cordu Village became our primary focus.*

*Consequently, after receiving an unusual distress letter, we
prioritized the mobilization of elite personnel and dispatched them as a
joint investigation team.*

*The investigators' complete written statements are as follows:*

*The anomaly in Cordu Village can be categorized into two levels:
reality and dreamscape.*

*Reality:*

*Cordu was ultimately destroyed by a large-scale but unsuccessful evil
god sacrificial ritual. Only a small number of villagers
survived.*

*Most villagers were utilized as nutrients for the failed creation of an
evil god. The remaining individuals were reassembled in peculiar ways
and transformed into various monsters.*

*The evil god sacrificial ritual altered the landscape. The river dried
up and changed course. The village square and cathedral were elevated
nearly 40 meters by a small-scale orogeny, forming a blood-colored
pillar.*

*The failed evil god creation was located atop the pillar. However, when
we discovered it, it had already been destroyed, potentially by
self-destruction or interference from other factions.*

*Cordu's houses also underwent reassembly. Some formed a twisted, thorny
city wall around the blood-colored pillar, while others were arranged in
circular patterns...*

*In these severely damaged buildings, we found only a few coins and the
most common livre bleu. We did not find any written information or
anything that could clearly identify Cordu. The reason remains
unknown.*

*Only the house of Lumian Lee---the target---contained books,
newspapers, magazines, and other items that clearly identified
it.*

*Within the ruins of Cordu, there are two abnormal areas surrounding the
blood-colored pillar. One can induce a deep slumber, leading to a
dreamscape, while the other is teeming with life, filled with flowers
and trees, and features a self-rocking crib.*

*Our assumption regarding the latter area is that it is closely related
to Madame Pualis of Cordu. (For a detailed explanation, refer to the
Dreamscape section.)*

*At the other edge of the blood-colored pillar, we unearthed four
relatively well-preserved corpses. The location likely corresponds to
the original cathedral cemetery.*

*The first corpse was a woman, no more than twenty years old, who had
been strangled to death.*

*The second corpse was a young man, also no more than twenty years old,
who had drowned.*

*The third corpse was surrounded by coffin fragments. Female, over 60
years old, and died of mechanical asphyxiation. Based on other evidence,
we speculate that she was suffocated with a pillow.*

*The fourth corpse was male and had not decomposed. His tongue had been
severed while he was alive, and there were visible ligature marks on his
neck.*

*Relevant speculations about the aforementioned corpses can be found in
the Dreamscape section.*

___

*Upon entering the ruins of Cordu, we were likely affected by the power
emanating from Lumian Lee's body. Our memories of the date became
disordered, and the thought of leaving ceased to occur to us.*

*One by one, we fell asleep. While in the dream state, our bodies
maintained a weak level of activity, eliminating the need for food
replenishment for several days. Had we remained in this state for
another half a month, it is uncertain whether we would have awoken from
hunger or perished within the dream.*

*The entire ruin is locked in a loop capable of reverting to its
original state at any moment. The trigger point is most likely tied to
Lumian Lee's self-awareness and the restrictions he imposes. The former
refers to the inevitable restart if Lumian Lee's subconscious
anticipates it, while the latter stems from his desire to prevent anyone
from disrupting Cordu's current state and the development of the dream.
Any relevant event would immediately trigger a restart.*

___

*We inquired with villagers from surrounding areas, but they reported no
abnormalities concerning Cordu.*

*Through their responses and previously gathered information, we
confirmed three points:*

*First, there was never a legend of a deceased Warlock in Cordu (this
refers to a story told by Lumian Lee in the dreamscape: Once, a Warlock
lived in Cordu. After his death, an owl perched on his bed head for a
time before flying away. The Warlock's corpse grew heavy, requiring nine
bulls to transport it);*

*Second, no elves suspected of being in the form of lizards have
appeared in the Dariège area.*

*Third, Lent is traditional folklore and had no issues
originally.*

___

*Dreamscape:*

*The dreamscape originated from Lumian Lee and is so realistic that we
couldn't discern that we were dreaming.*

*We consulted psychologists and dream experts and synthesized their
opinions to form a hypothesis about this dream.*

*It is an amalgamation of Lumian Lee's personal experiences, all the
novels he has read, and his assumptions and conjectures based on
previous events. The dream exhibits obvious coincidences and
characteristics of wish fulfillment at certain critical
junctures.*

*Within this dreamscape, not all the situations we encountered were
real, nor were they entirely fabricated.*

*Disorganized facts, the minutiae of daily interactions, and the
illusory scenes that left a profound impact on Lumian Lee were
reassembled in a chaotic and symbolic manner, presenting themselves to
us.*

*This is both a characteristic of the dreamscape and a manifestation of
Lumian Lee's subconscious avoidance or fear of certain issues.*

*Moving forward, we will provide a detailed account of every aspect of
our experience:*

___

*We ought to have realized that we were in a dream earlier on. The most
evident clue was that we did not recall needing to change our clothes
until Lumian Lee reminded us that our garments were severely
damaged.*

*Though this is quite unusual, humans tend not to think critically
within dreams.*

*It has been confirmed that we did not send telegrams. The corresponding
responses may have originated from Lumian Lee's subconscious and the
knowledge he possesses.*

*By combining the events in the dream with the situation in reality, we
have arrived at the following conjectures:*

*Our consciousness and knowledge, to some extent, enriched the dream,
and we may have inadvertently exposed some of our secrets to Lumian
Lee.*

*There are at least two distinct evil god faiths in Cordu. One
represents a power akin to Earth Mother's, embodied by Administrator
Béost's wife, Madame Pualis. The other is the one followed by Guillaume
Bénet, the former padre, and the majority of the villagers. The latter
faith ultimately led to Cordu's destruction.*

*During the Lent celebration, the Spring Elf's beheading and send-off
symbolized driving the force representing Madame Pualis out of Cordu.
There may have been a violent conflict between the two factions.
Simultaneously, the decapitation of Ava Lizier, the personification of
the Spring Elf, symbolized that this girl had discovered something amiss
in reality. When she attempted to escape or inform others, she was
clandestinely strangled to death by Guillaume Bénet's group.*

*Reimund Greg was thrown into the river. The appearance of his Spirit
Body beneath the cathedral symbolizes that, like Ava, he was deemed a
snitch and subsequently drowned.*

*Jean Maury discovered that his wife, Sybil, had an affair with the
former padre. In a fit of rage, he became mute. This symbolized that as
a devout follower of the Eternal Blazing Sun, his tongue was cut off
when he tried to inform others about the village's abnormalities. His
subsequent disappearance implied that he had been murdered.*

*Naroka's death shares the same potent symbolism as Ava, Reimund, and
Jean. First, she must have covertly followed Madame Pualis, intending to
allow her deceased husband's spirit to return home through the aid of
the soul messenger. Thus, her post-death behavior was to enter Paramita.
Second, it is highly likely that she was killed by her youngest son,
Arnault André, likely because she had discovered the issue with
Guillaume Bénet's group and wanted to inform Madame Pualis.*

*Based on our search of the ruins, the Lent celebration, and Madame
Pualis's claim that she could depart at a specific moment, it is implied
that she, her husband Béost, butler Louis Lund, and lady's maid Cathy
left Cordu before the ritual on the twelfth night. They remain alive,
and their whereabouts are unknown.*

*This is reflected in the dream by the lady's refusal to assist at
critical moments.*

*However, considering the circumstances in the peculiar area teeming
with vitality, we suspect that Madame Pualis left something behind
before her departure and indirectly participated in the ritual on the
twelfth night.*

*The black-robed man in the Warlock's tomb likely symbolizes Lumian
Lee's mutated persona due to his corruption. However, for some reason,
Lumian Lee did not appear to be deeply corrupted, enabling him to easily
triumph during the skirmish, given his increased courage...*

*The bizarre lizard-like creature found in the mouths of Aurore Lee,
Michel Garrigue, and others might symbolize their corruption and
mutation, eventually transforming them into an alternate version of
themselves.*

___

*Questions:*

*1. How is Lumian Lee aware of the abilities of Guillaume Bénet, Pierre
Berry, and others? If he had secretly observed them in reality, it would
be understandable if he remained undetected once or twice. There must be
an inherent reason why he could obtain so much information without
facing consequences.*

*2. Why did the villagers and Aurore Lee behave indistinguishably from
real people, making it challenging for us to recognize that we were in a
dream until Lumian Lee believed that something abnormal should have
occurred to them?*

*3. What does Paramita symbolize?*

*4. What do Madame Pualis's numerous children in the castle and the crib
with an invisible object represent?*

*5. Why did Lumian Lee use lizard-like elves to portray the villagers'
corruption?*

*6. What do Lumian Lee and Aurore Lee's attempts to escape Cordu and
enter Paramita signify?*

*7. Why did the ritual on the twelfth night fail?*

*8. How can Lumian Lee enable us to enter his dream? He evidently lacks
the ability to do so.*

*9. Why did he suddenly acquire normal Beyonder powers?*

*10. How did he survive and cause the ruins of Cordu to enter a
loop?*

*11. Aurore Lee's abnormalities occurred at entirely different times
during the two cycles. What does this indicate?*

*12. What does the legend of the deceased Warlock symbolize?*

*13. What does the Warlock's corpse in the coffin in the underground
tomb represent?*

*14. What does the owl symbolize?*

*15. What does the change in the horoscope signify?*

*16. What is the origin of the matter?*

___

*Conclusions and Recommendations:*

*This is a quintessential disaster resulting from the worship of an evil
god. Currently, six known survivors exist:*

*Lumian Lee, former padre Guillaume Bénet, Pualis de Roquefort, Béost,
Louis Lund, and Cathy.*

*The latter five are adherents of evil gods. We must locate and
eliminate them as soon as possible.*

*Directly killing Lumian Lee is not advised. Until his issues are
understood and resolved, his death might trigger an even more severe
anomaly. The optimal solution is to capture and securely contain
him.*
