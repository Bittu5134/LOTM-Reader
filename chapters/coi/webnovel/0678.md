## Chapter 678: Absurd Orgy

Amandina scrutinized the naked preacher, Cali, from head to toe. Her
gaze eventually settled on Robert, her fiancé, kneeling beside him.

The lad with brownish-yellow hair, his skin pale-white as if he had not
been exposed to the sun for a long time, had abandoned his usual cold
demeanor. He was equally excited, but he controlled himself and
patiently waited for the padre to complete his preaching.

The other naked men grew increasingly restless, gradually stirring.

However, it was evident that they held Padre Cali in high esteem.
Despite their disintegrating self-control, they refrained from directly
initiating the orgy, only occasionally making small movements.

*If God were watching, He would have incinerated all of them...*
As a believer in the Eternal Blazing Sun, Amandina subconsciously wanted
to kneel to the side and bow her head in repentance. What a blasphemous
scene!

Holding the open Sun Bible, Padre Cali continued to impart the teachings
of the Eternal Blazing Sun to the naked men with an abnormally excited
expression.

"God says, the sun shines justly upon everyone..."

During the preaching, Padre Cali's gaze frequently swept across Robert
and the other purebreds of the Northern Continent, their faces, chests,
and lower bodies. His expression revealed uncontrollable satisfaction,
pleasure, and enjoyment.

Lumian had always felt that he was well-read. In the past, he had
disrupted the Church's holy operations, but the scene before him still
exceeded his imagination, leaving him momentarily dumbfounded.

*Are the padres of the Eternal Blazing Sun Church among the most
"outstanding" Intisians?*

In an instant, information about Padre Cali and the observations of the
past few days appeared in Lumian's mind.

*He's a native of Port Pylos, possessing pure West Balam bloodline and a
lowly native of the Southern Continent. Starting as a cathedral servant,
he had seized the opportunity to change his fate. Subsequently, he had
worked diligently and eventually became the padre of Tizamo
Town.*

*He yearns for higher status and more recognition, especially from those
hailing from the Northern Continent...*

*Such long-standing desires have distorted the desires of Padre Cali. Is
he secretly targeting men from various countries in the Northern
Continent, attempting to subdue them and gain his sought-after
recognition?*

*Robert and the others are clearly relatively young. If Padre Cali had
started doing such things a few years ago, they would still have been
minors with immature minds. Tsk, you padres...* As Lumian
analyzed the current situation, he thought of his sister Aurore.

In Cordu, he had not liked entering the cathedral, attending Mass, or
praying often. On the one hand, Aurore did not like it herself and set
an example. On the other hand, Aurore had always been worried that
Lumian, who was only twelve or thirteen years old at the beginning,
would be alone with the clergyman in the cathedral. From time to time,
she would use words like "Boys have to protect themselves" and "Many
padres like boys."

Suppressing his sudden longing, Lumian looked at Padre Cali, who was
still engrossed in his preaching. The more he preached, the more excited
he became. Lumian felt that his analysis should be correct.

A lengthy holy sermon before a male orgy was clearly not something an
ordinary person could come up with and put into practice. It was
abnormally absurd.

However, considering that Padre Cali yearned for the Northern Continent
gentlemen's recognition, especially given his identity as the Eternal
Blazing Sun Church's padre, all of this became self-explanatory!

*Poor Eternal Blazing Sun and Saint Sien. They have become an important
prop for Padre Cali's performance art...* Just as Lumian thought
this, Padre Cali finally completed his "exciting" sermon.

He spread his arms and shouted, "Praise the Sun!"

Robert and the other lads, equally excited and naked, knelt on the
ground, spread their arms, and sang in unison, "Praise the Sun! Praise
His Grace!"

*The Sun does not wish to be praised by you... His Grace... Yes, it
aligns with the aspirations of Padre Cali for higher status. In this
male orgy, he made all participants view him as an archbishop and
preached to them... Finally, he would bestow the boon of God's holy
spirit on these people?* Lumian seemed to be able to imagine the
ensuing scene.

Padre Cali turned around in satisfaction and solemnly placed the Bible
back on the altar.

Then, he approached Robert, resembling an archbishop bestowing grace
upon his believers.

The other men tangled with each other.

Camus, Rhea, and Lugano, who were observing the cathedral through
another stained-glass window, were equally stunned.

In particular, Rhea felt as if her eyes, brain, and soul had been
tainted despite all her tragic experiences.

Upon regaining her senses, Rhea's anger surged.

Beside her, Lumian recalled a detail. He lowered his voice and asked
Amandina, "When did Robert become lovers with Padre Cali?"

Amandina retracted her corrupted gaze and pondered for a moment.

"More than a year after Padre Cali arrived in Tizamo, about three years
ago."

Lumian frowned and asked, "Did they become lovers in reality, or during
the Dream Festival?"

"Of course in reality," Amandina replied without hesitation.

*Something's off... Padre Cali had been in Tizamo for over a year. He
should have mellowed, turned restrained, and been devoid of excessive
desires and emotions. Why was he still targeting Robert and the other
lads? From the looks of it, there is something abnormal about Padre
Cali, and this abnormality should have been related to the source of the
Dream Festival. That is why he had declared its beginning...*
Just as Lumian thought this, he saw Rhea raise her bow angrily and aim
it at the cathedral, where the scene was becoming increasingly
unbearable and foul.

Almost simultaneously, the energetic Padre Cali turned his body.

Suddenly, Lumian, with one hand in his pocket, saw the native padre with
dark brown skin, sunken eyes, and thin black hair. His naked figure was
reflected in Lumian's eyes.

He felt a chilling aura emanating from Padre Cali's body, attempting to
completely freeze and replace his spirit.

Wraith Possession!

*So, Padre Cali possesses the ability to transform into a Wraith. It is
no wonder that when I investigated his weaknesses, I realized that it
only existed deep within the body, within the spirit... Heh heh, a
Wraith preaching in the Eternal Blazing Sun cathedral and under the
sunlight... Who would have thought such a thing would happen? Padre
Cali's Wraith powers definitely had not come from drinking potions. They
would definitely have been discovered and purified... A boon?*
Lumian came to a realization.

Relying on the strength of his Sequence 5 Spirit Body, Lumian struggled
to wrestle control of his body from Padre Cali.

He was not in a hurry to activate the Blood Emperor's aura brand.
Instead, he looked at Amandina and said with difficulty, word by word,
"Let... me... and... Cali... enter a dream..."

Lumian knew that Amandina's ability to forcefully pull people into a
dream could only be used one-on-one. However, Padre Cali was currently
attached to him and entangled with his Spirit Body. Perhaps she could
treat them as a unit.

As for whether Wraiths dreamed, Lumian did not know for now. After all,
he still had a backup plan.

With a resounding crash, Rhea's arrow shattered the stained-glass
window, sending shards crashing to the ground.

The arrow, entwined with silver-white lightning, crossed a distance of
more than ten meters, pierced the location where Padre Cali had been,
and nailed it to the wooden table with the candlestick.

Amidst crackling lightning, the long wooden table shattered and
collapsed to the ground, sending burning candles tumbling in all
directions.

Robert, clearly taken aback by the sudden departure of Padre Cali,
reacted. He opened his mouth and uttered strange words in a strange
language.

*Ooo! *As if a cold wind from the Feysac Empire's extreme north
blew, a blurry, strange, and inhuman figure materialized out of thin air
and burrowed into Robert's body.

A layer of armor-like ice materialized on Robert's body, and a colossal,
sharp, and crystalline frost scythe materialized in his hand.

Clutching the massive scythe, Robert sprinted toward Rhea, Camus, and
the others.

Wherever he passed, the ground froze, and icicles materialized on the
walls.

On the fourth floor of the Brieu Motel, in a room near the intersection,
two figures emerged from behind the curtains as Lumian and his
companions made their way to the street where Saint-Sien Cathedral
stood.

One of them was a man with distinct Northern Continent features. His
dark-green eyes stood out against his dark gray formal suit and black
silk top hat. The other was a woman with delicate skin, exquisite facial
features, and deep blue eyes. She wore a light-colored dress that
allowed for easy movement and a feathered hat adorned with pearls. They
were the couple Lumian had seen moving into the Brieu Motel late at
night.

They had arrived in Tizamo a mere ten minutes before the official Dream
Festival began.

At that moment, the man and woman's eyes were clear, devoid of any
excessive emotions or actions.

"The patrol team's sudden arrival in Tizamo is indeed because they
discovered the problem here," the beautiful woman said in a deep voice,
gazing out the window at the street below. "From the looks of it,
they've also found a way to remain lucid and rational in this special
dream."

The man's expression was cold as he nodded slightly and said, "But they
don't know much yet. They're moving in the wrong direction."

"Let's get moving." The woman in the feathered hat led the way to the
door.

The two of them descended the stairs swiftly, one after the other.

As they passed the second floor, the woman in the light-colored dress
suddenly stopped and whispered, "Do you hear something strange?"

The man in the half top hat listened intently for a few seconds before
hearing faint chewing sounds coming from a room deep on the second
floor.

The sound persisted without pause.
