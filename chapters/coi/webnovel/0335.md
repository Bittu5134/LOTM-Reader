## Chapter 335: Another World

Lumian withdrew his focus from the grimoire and turned his attention to
Franca.

"Is there a problem with that?"

He had meticulously studied the Soul Summoning Spell on numerous
occasions. If there had been a problem, he should have uncovered it
sooner.

His limitation lay in his inability to learn the spell and discern its
ultimate effects. However, as a Pyromaniac, he didn't possess the
necessary capacity for such learnings, being incompatible with the
corresponding Sequence.

Franca remained silent for a few seconds before speaking up, "What
happens when the Soul Summoning Spell is used on others?"

"It enables a spirit to reunite with the body from which it was
separated, providing a means to call back Astral Projections lost in the
spirit world, thus offering an opportunity for reconnection with their
physical forms," Lumian began, describing the spell based on Aurore's
grimoire before offering a personal example for clarity. "In the
previous battle, if I had been afflicted by Guillaume Bénet's Soul
Assimilation Mystic Spell, resulting in severe disorientation, the Soul
Summoning Spell might have roused me from unconsciousness. Naturally,
the premise here is that there exist Beyonders with the ability to learn
and employ this spell."

Franca disregarded Lumian's answer and inquired with gravitas, "What if
one were to employ it on oneself?"

*What kind of question is that?* Lumian pondered for a moment
and asked, "It would be ineffective. If no signs of separation between
spirit and body are evident, the spell would have no impact when cast on
oneself. If there's already a problem resembling such a condition, then
one wouldn't be able to employ any spells at all."

"But what if, hypothetically..." Franca began before her words trailed
off.

Jenna, observant and quick-witted, glanced at Franca, then at Lumian
before rising from her seat and flashing a smile.

"We've been engrossed in discussion for quite a while. Aren't you both
feeling hungry? How about I get some afternoon tea?"

"Sure," Lumian agreed on Franca's behalf.

He sensed that Franca was on the brink of revealing something that might
be problematic if Jenna caught wind of it. This was why she stopped
short in the midst of speaking.

Lumian had already contemplated introducing Jenna to Mr. Fool's faith.
They were comrades now, destined for numerous joint endeavors. In such
scenarios, certain secrets couldn't be concealed, and in constantly
doing so, would inevitably hinder collaboration.

As for whether to share information about the Tarot Club and
Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society, Lumian hadn't reached a
conclusion.

After careful consideration, he determined that preaching to Jenna would
be more fitting once she became a Witch. Her Sequence was still too low,
and she lacked the strength to shoulder the weight of such knowledge.
Too much information could make her vulnerable and inadvertently divulge
secrets. However, Sequence 7 Witches of the Assassin pathway represented
a qualitative transformation below the demigod tier, empowering Jenna to
fend for herself.

While Lumian remained unfamiliar with the Sequence 5 of this particular
pathway---its name and the Beyonder powers it encompassed---he believed
that a Sequence 6 Demoness of Pleasure didn't manifest a drastic
metamorphosis compared to a Witch. The latter could even alter an
individual's gender, illustrating the considerable gap in their
capabilities.

Franca's gaze followed Jenna's retreating figure until the sound of her
gradually fading footsteps reached her ears. She settled into a
cross-legged position on the recliner, emitting a soft sigh.

"It's not that Jenna couldn't know about this, but I'm concerned that it
might make her fearful of me, that she'll distance herself and view me
in a different way."

Lumian didn't pose the question: "Aren't you worried I might react
similarly?" He retook his seat, patience etched on his features as he
awaited Franca's explanation about the Soul Summoning Spell.

Franca's lips pursed, her demeanor wavering between hesitation and
apprehension. After a beat, she chuckled self-mockingly.

"It's also why I sensed a dangerous aura in this matter---otherwise, I
wouldn't have even thought about sharing this with you. I would have
kept it to my grave. Uh, there's another reason too---your Spell of
Harrumph's origins are of great significance to me. I hope you'll lay
bare all the details with me, just as I'm about to disclose my secret to
you.

"Sigh, we, members of the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society, share
one commonality---we all come from another world!"

With that, Franca slouched further into the recliner, seemingly drained
of energy.

Observing a Demoness of Pleasure adopt such a posture inadvertently
fueled a subtle warmth within Lumian, despite his thoughts being
directed elsewhere.

"Another world?" Lumian echoed, genuine surprise coloring his voice.

This was an outcome that hadn't even crossed his mind.

Such a possibility was one that ordinary individuals would scarcely
contemplate and a rarity even within the confines of fiction.

In a fleeting moment, he sensed an odd alignment with this notion.

With a conscious effort to rein in his emotions, he inquired
thoughtfully, "Is this the 'home' my sister often speaks of---the place
she claims she can never return to?"

Initially, Lumian had surmised that his sister's homeland had been
ravaged by conflict or catastrophe, hence her assertion of being unable
to return. Otherwise, armed with her Warlock strength, she could have
surreptitiously revisited, even if she was being pursued by the entire
world.

Subsequently, Lumian discovered Aurore's status as a Trierien, causing
him to find her references to an enigmatic "home" perplexing.

Franca's expression shifted into one of complex emotions upon hearing
Lumian's question. Her countenance was a blend of wistfulness,
melancholy, and sorrow.

"Does she frequently speak of 'home'?" Franca inquired, her eyes briefly
shuttered to mask the shifting emotions within.

Without awaiting Lumian's reply, Franca's lips pursed, and she
continued, "Think of it as another planet or alternate dimension."

Lumian dipped into his memories, muttering to himself, "No wonder she
enjoys climbing up to the rooftop to gaze at the cosmos..."

"The cosmos..." Franca echoed with a sigh.

A hushed ambiance enshrouded Apartment 601 as Lumian and Franca delved
into their introspective reveries.

After a pause, a memory resurfaced within Lumian's mind.

*Madam Magician had mentioned evil gods like the Mother Tree of Desire
existing outside our world, separated by a barrier. These entities
perpetually seek methods to breach that boundary.*

Lumian's gaze shifted toward Franca, and he voiced his thoughts, "Could
it be that all of you are spawn of an evil god released into this
world?"

"Pfft!" Franca immediately shook off her contemplative state. "Do we
look anything like that to you?"

"No," Lumian responded after a brief pondering, "You're far too weak for
the efforts of the evil gods to be expended in sending you here. They
could have instead focused on sending more of Their Saints. Or perhaps
They are pinning Their hopes on your potential growth?"

After all, being weak had its own advantages. Infiltration through the
barrier would be less likely to be detected.

Amused and slightly annoyed, Franca was tempted to refute his words, but
tangible evidence eluded her grasp, leaving her with little recourse.

"In any case, I've come to believe in Mr. Fool. Not one member of the
Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society whom I've encountered shares faith
in an evil god."

"Even if they did, they might not reveal it to you..." Lumian muttered.

Franca ignored his comment and continued, "I also remain uncertain about
the why behind our transmigration. I've been seeking an answer for quite
some time. What I do know is that we arrived in this world as spirits
and found ourselves reborn within other individuals' bodies. It's
comparable to Guillaume Bénet's process of Rebirth."

Drawing on this analogy, Lumian effortlessly comprehended the situation
of Franca and her companions in the Curly-Haired Baboons Research
Society.

"In other words, you inhabit the bodies of other people?"

"Yes." Franca cast a sidelong glance at Lumian, remarking, "Are you
disheartened to learn that the sister you hold dear is essentially a
wandering spirit occupying another's body?"

"Why would I be disheartened?" Lumian responded casually. "Aurore Lee,
the person who took me in and shared my life in Cordu for nearly six
years, is my sister. I care not for the past of that body or its
history."

Franca seemed to seek Lumian's perspective on her own behalf, "Don't you
find this situation morally dubious? Do you not consider your sister and
me as thieves who appropriate the corpses and lives of others? Does this
not present you with moral dilemmas or conflicts?"

"I have no morals," Lumian replied calmly.

Expanding upon his statement, he added, "I show kindness to those who
are kind to me."

Franca's mouth slightly agape, she struggled to find an immediate
rejoinder.

Lumian glanced at her and said, "That person is already deceased. It's a
pragmatic use of available resources. If guilt weighs on you, treat
her---no, his family well. Perhaps even fulfill some of his unfulfilled
desires."

"True." Franca pressed her lips together, nodding in agreement.

Steering the conversation back to its initial trajectory, she inquired,
"What might occur if individuals like us were to employ the Soul
Summoning Spell on ourselves?"

"Could it summon a departed spirit? And if there's an underlying issue
with the spirit itself..." Lumian's train of thought expanded abruptly.

Simultaneously, he recalled a line of inquiry introduced by Madame Hela,
the vice president of the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society.

"Muggle's parents and other relatives likely remain alive in this world.
For some reason, she distanced herself from them and refrains from
returning to Trier. It's unclear whether there's something amiss with
them or if they've come into contact with heretics..."

*Did Madame Hela already harbor suspicions?* Lumian's brows
furrowed as he whispered,

"Could Roche Louise Sanson be the original body's spirit? Is she and
some of her family members associated with Inevitability, perhaps even
linked to the Sinners organization?"

"Continuing our investigation in that direction is indeed a
possibility," Franca admitted after a moment's contemplation. "Two other
questions arise. Why did Muggle resort to the Soul Summoning Spell for
herself? Did the April Fool's member who sold her the spell foresee this
outcome?"

Franca had chosen to share the secret of their transmigration with
Lumian, sensing that something might be awry within the Curly-Haired
Baboons Research Society and discerning an impending threat.

Lumian offered a subdued nod, his expression void of emotion. A subtle
smile played upon his lips as he ventured, "You mentioned that April
Fool's Day was formed by members of the Curly-Haired Baboons Research
Society who are disheartened by the future and seek only joy. Could it
be that the individual who sold Aurore the Soul Summoning Spell hoped to
experience such amusement?"

Franca fell into a brief contemplative silence before replying, "I don't
know. I'll take charge of locating the April Fool's member and delve
into their motivations."

Lumian offered a curt acknowledgment. "I'll follow the trail of Roche
Louise Sanson."

With the conversation surrounding the Soul Summoning Spell concluded, an
interim quiet settled within the living room of Apartment 601.

After a pause, Franca exhaled softly and told Lumian, "You can now tell
me about the Spell of Harrumph."
