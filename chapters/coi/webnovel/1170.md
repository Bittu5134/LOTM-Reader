## Chapter 1170: Past Symbolism

When the crimson moonlight descended, Klein immediately realized that
Grisha Adam likely couldn't hold on much longer. He had been barely
maintaining a fragile balance, temporarily reaching quasi-Great Old One
strength, only through the merging of Herabergen's and Leodoro's
consciousness. Once granted New Life, the accumulated latent issues
would swiftly manifest.

If the Primordial God Almighty truly gained the upper hand and the
Mother Goddess of Depravity returned fully healed, the situation would
become irredeemable.

At that moment, three contingency plans formed in Klein's mind:

The first plan had the Evernight Goddess forcibly put Grisha Adam and
the Primordial God Almighty's consciousness into slumber. This would buy
more time, or perhaps allow Klein to find a way to kill Grisha Adam,
putting an end to the possibility of the Primordial God Almighty
resurrecting with the Mother Goddess of Depravity's assistance.

The issue with this plan was that it would release Primordial Hunger. At
that point, it would likely take a substantial bite out of Grisha Adam,
and this insatiable entity would inevitably seek out Lumian, attempting
to accommodate the City of Calamity. Combined with the possible return
of Inextinguishable Ravings in a short while, the situation would spiral
completely out of control.

The second plan utilized the Change symbolism to delay the adverse
changes in Grisha Adam, keeping Him as a buffer against Primordial
Hunger. Klein would give up chasing the Mother Tree of Desire and
recovering the Tenebrous World for now. Instead, he would focus on
delaying the Goddess of Fate and Supernova Dominator while joining the
battle between the remaining three sefirot and the High-Dimensional
Overseer. The goal would be to heavily wound or eliminate this Great Old
Dominator as quickly as possible.

This would free the sefirot to assist Lumian and the Evernight Goddess,
potentially bringing that battlefield to a swift resolution. If the
Primordial God Almighty had not yet resurrected by then, the situation
would be brought under control and significantly improve.

The downside to this plan was that if Klein became deeply entangled in
the fight against the High-Dimensional Overseer, he would struggle to
manage the Goddess of Fate and Supernova Dominator in the other star
dominions. Should They intervene, the situation could become even more
chaotic and deteriorate further.

The third plan was to once again use the Change symbolism to allow
Grisha Adam to hold on a little longer. Meanwhile, Klein would avoid the
battle with the High-Dimensional Overseer, refrain from interfering with
the Circle of Inevitability or joining Lumian and the Evernight
Goddess's battlefield, and not pursue the Mother Tree of Desire.
Instead, he would focus all his efforts on confronting the Goddess of
Fate and Supernova Dominator.

Although it would be a two-against-one situation, the symbolisms of
these two Great Old Dominators did not directly restrain the Lord of
Mysteries. By further utilizing the Pillar's symbolisms, Klein had a
chance to severely wound the Goddess of Fate and Supernova Dominator,
forcing Them to give up and flee, or temporarily seal Them before the
Primordial God Almighty could resurrect---despite interference from the
Mother Goddess of Depravity.

Afterward, Klein could exchange places with the Evernight Goddess,
personally dealing with the Circle of Inevitability while the Evernight
Goddess put Grisha Adam into slumber and hold off Primordial Hunger.

In a one-on-one confrontation, Klein was confident he could swiftly deal
with the Circle of Inevitability, racing against time before the Mother
Goddess of Depravity healed and descended once more. Even if he couldn't
isolate the Circle of Inevitability, Klein could simultaneously hold
back the Monarch of Decay, enabling Lumian to execute a pre-prepared
move that would make the Monarch of Decay experience what it meant by
being the Origins of Disaster.

The only flaw in this plan was that every second would count---any
wasted moment could lead to failure!

As for the idea of feeding the Uniquenesses of the Moon and Mother
pathways to Primordial Hunger to provoke the Mother Goddess of Depravity
into dealing with Him, this approach lacked real feasibility. Unless
Lord of Mysteries Klein went to the Mother Goddess of Depravity now,
making Her succumb to Foolishness and completing a Deceit, She could
afford to wait until the situation grew more chaotic and both sides were
heavily wounded before descending.

Even if Klein did seek out the Mother Goddess of Depravity, She was
still a Pillar, albeit weakened and injured. He wouldn't be able to
spare his attention for the other battlefields for some time.

Klein made his decision in an instant. His high-frequency flickering
figure raised its coat.

Change!

The symbolism was applied to the enormous luminous figure, immediately
delaying the adverse effects of the crimson moonlight.

Next, Klein transferred Amon from the Chaos Sea to the peripheral planet
at the universe's edge, leaving behind only the Chained Uniqueness and
Sequence 1 Beauty Goddess Beyonder characteristic from Lilith, which he
Grafted into Sefirah Castle.

After completing this, Klein's flickering figure disappeared from the
star dominion.

He returned to the original battlefield, now fully intent on dealing
with the Goddess of Fate and Supernova Dominator!

†

In the meantime, Amon appeared on the peripheral planet of the universe.
Still affected by His survival instinct, He hid within the protected
zone, not daring to venture out.

On the battlefield outside the protected zone, Franca and other angels
were stunned to find that the Cupids and Leviathans had simultaneously
left the area, entering the universe and disappearing.

This significantly reduced the pressure on them.

The beautiful Cupids had been firing arrows that stole True Hearts,
inciting internal strife. Meanwhile, the Leviathans had stirred up
jealousy and dissatisfaction among many Angels, nearly causing the
disbandment of the Red Angel Medici's legion. It was only thanks to The
Star Leonard, Arianna, and other Servants of Concealment who put the
affected Angels into slumber, and Justice Audrey and other Spectator
pathway Angels who used Hypnosis, Placate, or implanted virtual
personalities, that the angelic legion avoided greater turmoil.

Now, for whatever reason, the departure of the Cupids and Leviathans
from the battlefield was a welcome relief for Medici, the legion
commander.

In the boundless void, sometimes shrouded in the Fog of War and other
times plunged into darkness.

The voice of Lumian echoed in Eternal Darkness Amanises's mind. "Change
of strategy---target the Circle of Inevitability first."

Previously, Lumian had aimed to use his preparations to swiftly wound or
eliminate the Monarch of Decay, making Him the primary target.

He and Amanises had nearly succeeded three times, but each time, the
Circle of Inevitability had intervened---either resetting the state
through Loop or exerting influence via the symbolism of Inevitability.

This caused Lumian to be affected by the symbolism of Decay, where
"anything that can go wrong will go wrong," further destabilizing his
internal balance and reducing the time he could sustain himself by
another minute.

Hence, Lumian decided not to remain trapped in this back-and-forth. A
breakthrough was needed, starting with eliminating the support and the
disruptive interference.

Although the Circle of Inevitability was even harder to eliminate
quickly---whether through His Loop symbolism or His combination of
Future and Destined symbolisms that made Him nearly impossible to
hit---Lumian felt it was worth a try given the deadlock elsewhere.

He also noticed the crimson moonlight and understood the urgency of
time!

Suddenly, Lumian once again conjured the Fog of War to envelop the void,
swapping his position with Eternal Darkness Amanises.

Eternal Darkness Amanises now faced the golden mummy-like Monarch of
Decay.

The strange book of coiled feathered serpents in Her hands flipped open
with a rustling sound, displaying only one name written across its
pages: "Monarch of Decay."

Death!

Amanises invoked the symbolism of Death!

Time, already slow around the Monarch of Decay, slowed further, pushing
His body into the depths of illusory ripples.

There, it seemed to reach the end of time, the final point of change.

The Monarch of Decay did not evade the influence of Death. Instead, He
used His symbolism as the End of the River of Time to delay Death until
that endpoint, leaving the present unaffected.

As Amanises dealt with the Monarch of Decay, Lumian, with his omniscient
perspective within the Fog of War, located the Circle of Inevitability.

The body with Aurore's and Jenna's face clenched its right hand.

They caused all contradictions in the area to erupt instantly,
transforming the apocalypse into a vortex of chaos that swallowed nearby
asteroids, along with time, space, and fate.

This chaos vortex rapidly expanded toward the Circle of Inevitability,
targeting not His body but a fixed tributary within the mercury-colored
River of Fate.

It sought to drag this tributary into the apocalypse, returning it to
chaos, thereby breaking the Circle of Inevitability's Destined powers.

The Circle of Inevitability's three bodies began spinning around a
single point.

He attempted to trigger a Loop not yet affected by the chaos vortex,
resetting the state of the battlefield.

At this moment, Amanises suddenly abandoned applying symbolic influence
on the Monarch of Decay. Instead, using the team's connection, She
unleashed deep darkness like a river from the void near Lumian, pulling
time and space into Herself and merging them swiftly.

Eternal Darkness was also Space-Time-in-One!

Although this symbolism was incomplete, it managed to halt the Circle of
Inevitability's spinning, suspending Him like an insect trapped in
amber.

Origins of Disaster Lumian seized the opportunity, allowing the chaos
vortex to spread over, engulfing the fixed tributary of fate and the
pre-set Loop node.

Then, the chaos vortex, embodying all colors and possibilities, consumed
the three-bodied Circle of Inevitability, causing Him to collapse into
chaos in an instant.

Neither Lumian nor Amanises paused to confirm their victory, as the
Monarch of Decay made the Fog of War advance to its end and applied the
symbolism of Certain Death to them.

A second later, at the dissipating chaos vortex's center, the dark body
of the Circle of Inevitability reappeared. He had reunited with His
mercury-colored and redemptive light-formed bodies, resuming His hand
signs.

Past symbolism!

What was not lost in the past could not be destroyed in the present!

Lumian instantly realized one thing: only by using the kind of power
associated with the Fourth Pillar---erasing the very concept of the
Circle of Inevitability's existence and His past history---could He be
truly wounded or killed.

Of course, the King of Space-Time, who held the symbolism of History,
might not be able to kill the Circle of Inevitability but could
certainly inflict suffering worse than death.
