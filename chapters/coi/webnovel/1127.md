## Chapter 1127: Suggestions

The next day, in Trier's Avenue du Boulevard, within a garden apartment
not far from the Grand Palace.

Lumian and Franca, under the guidance of The Hermit Cattleya, arrived at
a third-floor terrace. There, they saw Queen Mystic Bernadette dressed
in hunting attire, holding a watering can, tending to several potted
plants placed around her.

"Long time no see," Queen Mystic said, setting down the watering can and
turning to the visitors.

"Long time no see," Franca replied. In the dream city, she and the Queen
had not only collaborated but also chatted a few times. With their
shared connection related to transmigrators, Franca felt more respect
than fear---perhaps even a sense of closeness.

"I thought you'd be at sea," she began chatting.

Queen Mystic Bernadette smiled faintly. "Before the apocalypse, I prefer
to stay in Trier. Moreover, as a Sage and former princess of Intis, I
feel it is my duty to protect the citizens here, prevent various
disasters, and maintain stability and order. This environment is
particularly conducive to digesting the Sage potion, especially in the
first couple of months."

As she said this, Bernadette glanced at The Hermit Cattleya, seemingly
imparting a lesson.

"Ah, that makes sense." Franca nodded in understanding. "So, are you
almost done digesting your Sage potion?"

"Almost," Bernadette replied succinctly.

She turned to Lumian. "You want me to divine the whereabouts of the
Primordial Demoness?"

"Yes, please help us," Lumian said sincerely.

Queen Mystic Bernadette's eyes grew deep, like the sea before a
storm---boundless and unfocused.

Faint, blurry images flickered across her vision, as if mercury-like
rivers emerged and vanished.

Two streaks of crimson tears trickled down Bernadette's cheeks as her
detached, ethereal voice sounded.

"I see the Primordial Demoness smiling, an abyssal mirror world, and a
crimson full moon."

*Crimson full moon...* The phrase sent a shiver down the spines
of not only Lumian and Franca but also The Hermit Cattleya.

To Beyonders aware of the protected zones' truths, the "crimson full
moon" was like a trauma etched deep into their consciousness. Its mere
mention brought it vividly to mind.

This prophecy differs significantly from Ma'am Hermit's, even containing
contradictions... Clearly, consulting multiple high-level individuals
skilled in divination and prophecy would allow me to piece together more
useful revelations. It's like the story Aurore once told about blind men
piecing together the image of an elephant---each by touch alone can only
describe a part, and the complete truth requires combining their
perspectives. Lumian's central head nodded slightly in acknowledgment.

He began considering the connections between the three prophecies.

*The Post-Apocalyptic Scripture claims I will encounter Cheek in the
World of Ruins. That could be false, but treating it as true and
preparing accordingly might make it true. The variable is whether it can
influence a true god.*

*Ma'am Hermit's prophecy points to the primeval rainforest of the
Southern Continent, aligning with the Post-Apocalyptic Scripture's basic
premise.*

*Queen Mystic's prophecy doesn't clarify if it's in the protected zones
or the World of Ruins. However, if a crimson full moon rises in the
World of Ruins, things will become troublesome---gravely so. At best, it
means the Mother Goddess of Depravity has turned Her gaze upon
us...*

Lumian shared the prior prophecies, hoping to see how the former
Clairvoyants, now Sages Bernadette and Cattleya, would interpret them.

"Somewhere in the World of Ruins' mirror world---or perhaps within the
special mirror world," Queen Mystic speculated.

The Hermit Cattleya added, "The features there reflect the primeval
rainforest of the Southern Continent.

"The crimson full moon may also be a product of the mirror world's
reflections. For now, its symbolism remains unclear."

Lumian nodded and said to Franca and Ma'am Hermit, "Mr. Fool has
entrusted me with something to discuss with the Queen."

Though now an Angel, Cattleya didn't assert, "There's nothing I can't
hear." Instead, she led Franca to a small lounge on the first floor to
enjoy tea and snacks.

"What does Mr. Fool need?" Queen Mystic Bernadette withdrew her gaze
from the terrace's exit and inquired of Lumian.

She had not foreseen this request but now carried some guesses.

Lumian smiled. "Mr. Fool wants me to relay a message to Genie."

Bernadette nodded slightly, extended her right hand, and traced numerous
starlit words in the air. These words intertwined into strange symbols,
opening a "secret door" to an unknown location.

The door swung open swiftly, and a howling gale emerged, coalescing into
a figure---a man with his head wrapped in white cloth, his upper body
human-shaped, and his lower body composed of flowing air currents.

"Magic Wishing Lamp," Bernadette addressed in her usual tone.

The man respectfully retrieved an object from within his wrapped
layers---a gold, intricately patterned vessel resembling a small lamp.

"0-05---Magic Wishing Lamp."

Bernadette ran her fingers over the lamp's golden surface and called its
name, "Genie."

The lamp's wick ignited with a flash, releasing a thick, golden radiance
akin to viscous liquid.

The light hesitated, reluctant and resistant, before forming a hazy,
distorted figure with a blue-white interior and a faint golden outer
layer.

The resilience of a Great Old Dominator is truly amazing. Even after
losing their sefirah, Uniqueness, and Beyonder characteristics, reduced
to mere consciousness, spirit, and status, He has recovered enough
within a year after suffering severe trauma to respond. Though feeble,
He is far from permanently comatose or deeply asleep... Lumian thought
wistfully.

Genie surveyed the room, ready to utter some perfunctory remarks before
retreating back into the Magic Wishing Lamp, but Lumian interrupted, "If
I were you, I'd hear what Mr. Fool has to say. It concerns your
future---perhaps even your end."

Genie's grand, majestic voice replied, "My future is already determined
unless He chooses to break His promises."

Lumian detected the undeniable frailty in Genie's voice and smiled.

"Mr. Fool will undoubtedly honor his promise, but that time hasn't
arrived yet, isn't that so?

"He posed a scenario: what if he perishes before that time comes? In
matters of fulfillment, this is considered force majeure. And His
'successor' might be someone you wouldn't want to see---someone for whom
breaking promises and deceiving rules is as effortless as breathing."

Lumian paused briefly before continuing, "Let's consider another
possibility. If the Great Old Ones breach the barrier before we can
respond adequately, killing Mr. Fool, Grisha Adam, and other true gods,
might one of Them target the Nation of Disorder?

"Although They can no longer accommodate Sefirah Castle or the Chaos
Sea, proximity might allow them to accommodate the Nation of Disorder.
At that time, what attitude would the successful one adopt toward a
weakened you? If They freed you from the Magic Wishing Lamp, would you
dare emerge? No, by then, the Magic Wishing Lamp might no longer be
capable of protecting you."

"Eventually, They would pursue the Uncertain Mist, completing the Son of
Chaos. Your spirit may indeed persist, but only to wail eternally within
Their belly, enduring perpetual torment."

Genie remained silent.

Lumian smiled and continued, "You know Mr. Fool's credibility. As long
as he lives and the world endures, he will fulfill his promise and
return you to the cosmos."

Seeing Genie about to respond, Lumian added, "No need to argue with me
or twist my ideas. I'm merely the messenger for Mr. Fool---not the
decision-maker."

After several seconds of silence, Genie's majestic voice reverberated.
"What does He wish to say?"

Lumian smiled. "Mr. Fool hopes you can offer some advice for the
impending apocalypse.

"He knows you're currently weak and unable to grant wishes or accomplish
much, but your status and insight remain."

Genie gazed at the head on Lumian's left shoulder for a while, then
spoke grandly, "Three hints:

"First, the Circle of Inevitability will bring calamity but is also the
universe's most powerful and genuine Angel of Redemption."

This seems to suggest utilizing the godhood and symbolism of the Circle
of Inevitability? Lumian refrained from questioning further, knowing
Genie wouldn't elaborate.

"Second," Genie's voice rumbled solemnly, "your uniqueness and the
symbolism of the Lord of Mysteries."

Lumian watched Genie silently, awaiting further exposition.

"Third, at critical moments, temporarily enhance the Nation of
Disorder," Genie concluded.

Hearing this, Queen Mystic Bernadette frowned ever so slightly.

Genie's voice carried a trace of amusement. "This advice indeed benefits
me to some extent, but you may choose to ignore it.

"Make haste; my elder sister will accommodate the Brood Hive faster than
you think."

With that, the faint golden figure retreated into the Magic Wishing
Lamp.

In His weakened state, Genie had no desire to remain exposed for long.

Bernadette mulled over the message briefly before telling Lumian, "I
understand Mr. Fool's intentions now."

Lumian nodded, smiling as he took his leave.
