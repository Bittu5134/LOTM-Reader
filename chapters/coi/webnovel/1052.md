## Chapter 1052: Reluctant Showing Off

Late at night.

Neither Anthony's intelligence channels, nor Franca's gang informants,
nor Jenna's neighborhood contacts were able to provide any information
related to the Sick Church.

Franca sat down at the mechanical typewriter, turned on the wireless
telegraph transceiver, preparing to ask 007 if the Eternal Blazing Sun
Church had gathered any valuable intelligence.

"Ding, group message notification: Hidden Blade, who did another good
deed today, has joined the chat!" Franca announced her arrival in the
telegraph group.

Before she could send a second message, she saw a telegram come in with
007 as the header: "Hidden Blade, you didn't actually advance to
Sequence 4, but to Sequence 3, right?"

The other telegrams that should have responded to Franca suddenly came
to a halt.

Franca was stunned at first, then understood.

*Wow, I originally didn't want to show off about this, but you helped me
do it anyway?*

She felt she should display three parts helplessness, three parts pain,
three parts confusion, plus one part inevitable secret joy, so she
carefully replied: "Ah... yes."

After a brief, indescribable silence, one telegram after another was
spat out by the small analyzer under queue control, accompanied by
clicking sounds.

The mechanical typewriter seemed overwhelmed, working so hard it might
start smoking.

"Are you serious?"

"Hidden Blade, that kind of joke isn't funny, it's too cruel!"

"Hidden Blade, I remember you mentioning just a month ago that you were
a Sequence 5 Demoness of Affliction, and now you're Sequence 3 in just a
month? Even a rocket isn't that fast!"

"Have you been blessed by the God of Fortune lately?"

"A Sequence 3 Demoness, I can't imagine how beautiful and charming..."

"Really, are there any secrets to advancing? Name your price, we
brothers might be able to scrape together a down payment."

"Hidden Blade, did something happen to you? Do you need any help? At my
sequence, I might not be able to participate in combat, but I can help
curse those people!"

"..."

"007, how did you know?"

After the expression of various emotions and feelings, someone finally
brought the topic back on track.

007 replied: "Hidden Blade is now a patron saint of a cathedral, with
her own honorific name."

*Sure enough, the changes at Saint Franca Cathedral had been noticed by
the Eternal Blazing Sun Church, and 007 had known before that I was "Red
Boots" Franca Roland...* Franca's speculation was confirmed.

"Patron saint... honorific name... I really can't connect these two
terms with the 'life is short, why not give it a shot' Hidden Blade."
Moon King was the first to marvel.

"Indeed." Wind Sound sent a telegram in response. "It's too surreal, too
surreal, more surreal than any fantasy novel!"

"Please show some respect to the great Hidden Blade!"

"Lord Hidden Blade, is there any chance you could take me as your
apprentice?"

"You want to become a Demoness too? If I remember correctly, you can
switch."

"I can't accept that the strongest in the research society is now the
silly Hidden Blade..."

"Hey, if you put it that way, wouldn't that make us even more silly and
stupid?"

"..."

Looking at these telegrams, Franca couldn't help but curl her lips into
a smile.

*I have to say, showing off like this feels pretty good!*

Moreover, those joking remarks gave her a sense of still being grounded,
still connected to the masses.

"Hey hey hey," she quickly typed out the words, "You don't really think
I'm brainless, do you? I was just being approachable before, trying to
get along with you all."

Then, she humbly added: "Madame Hela should also be Sequence 3 now,
either a bit earlier or later than me.

"As for the President, I'm not quite sure."

"So you really are Sequence 3... Is there anything you can tell us about
it?" Wind Sound and others asked in succession.

Franca elaborated a bit more than before: "In advancing to Sequence 4,
digesting the Sequence 4 potion, and advancing to Sequence 3, I met some
special conditions as a transmigrator that allowed me to take shortcuts,
so I became a Saint with an honorific name within a month."

She didn't mention that she had completely digested the Sequence 3
potion, after all, the telegraph group had quite a few members, and most
of which she hadn't met in the real world. Although she was willing to
trust their character, she couldn't gamble on their
circumstances---critical information about her Sequence abilities still
needed to be kept secret.

Besides, if someone asked what a Sequence 3 Demoness was called, Franca
didn't want to hide it, because after 007 pointed out that she was
already a patron saint of a cathedral, her honorific name couldn't be
hidden from those who paid attention. This way, some telegraph group
members might make certain connections between the instant digestion of
a Sequence potion and the name Demoness of Unaging.

"One month..."

"Really only took one month..."

"..."

At this point, Moon King, Wind Sound, and others seemed to have lost
even the mood to joke.

"So what kind of Demoness are you now?" After a while, group member
Little Peppa asked.

*I knew it!* Franca immediately replied: "Demoness of Unaging."

"Unaging... eternal youth?" Little Peppa seemed somewhat envious.

Moon King then asked: "Can you also extend lifespan?"

"Theoretically speaking, living another two thousand years wouldn't be a
problem." Franca tried to control her pride.

"So envious..." Group members responded with similar words.

One after another, all expressing genuine feelings.

Who wouldn't want to be immortal and ageless?

As for the negative effects of the potion, there were no ordinary people
in this group!

Franca thought for a moment, then typed out more words: "For those in
the Trier region, if you have difficulties and need help, you can recite
my honorific name.

"For those not in the Trier region, I can't help---I won't hear it and
can't respond.

"My honorific name is:

"The One Who Never Ages, Keeper of Diseases and Plagues, the Demoness
Accompanied by Strife and Catastrophe, the Cup Bearing Joy and Pain, the
Great Franca Roland."

Seeing this honorific name, seeing the prefix "Great," the telegraph
group members truly realized that Hidden Blade had obtained godhood, was
half-god half-human, and possessed an honorific name, was a patron saint
of a cathedral, could respond to prayers, and bestow power.

After a while, Little Peppa sighed.

"I feel like there's now a sad, thick barrier between us..."

"Want to call me lord and let me hear it?" Franca very skillfully
responded to these words.

After discussing her own matters and explaining that Cup took its
concept from the Tarot Cup cards's corresponding symbolism and the
sacred object that bore joy and pain, she finally asked 007:

"007, do you have more intelligence about the Sick Church?"

Based on their team's collection and analysis of information, they
believed that the Order of All Extinction and the Sick Church probably
worshiped the same evil god, but the former mainly corrupted the upper
and middle classes, while the latter targeted the lower classes,
preaching about the authority of the Malady God and the terror of
illness, developing followers through intimidation.

007 typed neither fast nor slow, with telegrams coming in line by line:
"The several Sick Church-related cases discovered earlier have been
handled, and the corresponding Blessed have been eliminated, but we
still haven't found their upper ranks.

"Those followers who only know the name Malady God, we now have
sufficient manpower, with Mid-Sequence Beyonders watching them, to see
if anyone will contact them or if any unusual events occur.

"Besides these, there's no other intelligence. The cultists in Trier
have been very quiet for the past month or two, hiding very deep."

*Very well-behaved? This is very similar to the state before the Hostel
incident... Is something big really going to happen within a year or
two? Other great existences might not know what the Great Mother wants
to do and how She would do it, but They should have foreseen that
something would happen, after all, we've all made some guesses, so
They've restricted the Blessed in Trier, letting them either transfer
elsewhere or wait patiently to fish in troubled waters when the time
comes?* Franca made her own speculation based on 007's words.

At the same time, she also caught another hint from 007.

Followers who only knew the name Malady God could be saved.

*Indeed, those great existences all preach using aliases, not letting
followers truly understand Them. This isn't because They're merciful,
but because truly understanding Them inevitably leads to corruption.
Some might be fine, only experiencing personality alteration and extreme
mentality, but most would have their bodies collapse, becoming monsters
that constantly spread corruption, making it impossible to preach in
secret, as it would be easily discovered by official forces...*
Franca muttered silently.

One reason why seeking boons required performing rituals was to protect
the corresponding humans through the ritual, and after establishing a
stable but temporary channel, the corresponding being could consciously
contain the mental and will corruption in the boon, preventing the
bestowed from collapsing on the spot.

Even Saints like Franca and Lumian's understanding of those great
existences was limited to aliases, but compared to other Sequence 4 and
Sequence 3 demigods, they also know that these existences stand at the
top of multiple paths.

In reality, among the great existences, the only one who didn't preach
using an alias was the Mother Tree of Desire.

Madam Magician mentioned that Mother Tree of Desire was a small segment
of the corresponding existence's long string of honorific names. There
were two reasons why understanding and reciting it didn't directly bring
corruption: First, it was only a small segment, incomplete; second, the
Mother Tree of Desire indirectly controlled the one worshiped by the
Rose School of Thought in the real world and the Devil Monarch in the
Abyss, so when this honorific name was mentioned, under conditions of
limited understanding and while the barrier still existed, the
proximity-based mystical phenomenon occurred, making it not so
dangerous.

"What can we do..." Franca didn't hide the troubles of a Saint with an
honorific name.

007 quickly replied: "Trier has gathered a large amount of official
force, those cultists won't surface for now. Later, we'll have enough
manpower to investigate everyone in key positions.

"That's how it is in Trier, but in the marginal towns of the Trier
region, in places where the Church and government forces are weak, there
might still be active cultists. You can go look in those places."

*Right, with Trier's current situation, we definitely won't find anyone,
but we can search in the suburbs and villages... Indeed, only official
Beyonders have this kind of vision and experience, we would have wasted
some time before possibly thinking of this...* Franca
immediately replied to 007: "Genius!"
