## Chapter 1057: The Key Point

Lumian deliberately spoke very clearly to ensure no one would overlook
it.

Moreover, he pointed out that this matter was dangerous, and he had
experience in how to resolve it.

This way, if any of the present Warlocks had been infused with mystical
knowledge about summoning White Papers and hadn't yet undergone complete
personality alteration, they would surely be alarmed, become fearful,
and then either openly or secretly seek him out to discuss whether the
problem truly existed and what solutions there might be.

Professor, who represented the Academy group's Warlocks, thought for a
moment and shook his head. "I've never been infused with knowledge in
this area."

After the other Warlocks gave similar answers, a man who had spoken
little in the previous discussion suddenly said, "The weak ball that can
telepathically connect with me, right?

"I received related knowledge."

Lumian's heart leaped with joy as he looked at this Academy group member
who was also dressed as a warlock, remembering his codename: Condensed
Matter.

"Yes," Lumian nodded, glancing around before asking Condensed Matter,
"May I ask you some questions in private? If you're unsure about me, we
can have Madame Hela present."

Worried that he might already have hidden problems due to that mystical
knowledge, Condensed Matter didn't refuse Lumian's invitation. "Okay."

Soon, in a corner of the ancient palace, with Hela witnessing, Lumian
questioned Condensed Matter, "Have you used those descriptions to summon
the corresponding spirit world creature?"

"I have," Condensed Matter couldn't help asking, "Is there something
wrong with that?"

Lumian's brows furrowed slightly beneath his silver-white half mask, and
instead of answering, he asked, "Can you sense anything special about
me?"

He wanted to see if the other person could detect Omebella's bloodline.

"Does being particularly charming count?" Condensed Matter answered
honestly.

"It does," Lumian smiled behind his silver-white half mask, "When did
you first summon that spirit world creature?"

"Around June or July two years ago," Condensed Matter recalled.

*June or July two years ago... By then, Madame Pualis and the padre
already had the child...* Lumian thought for a moment and asked,

"After being infused with this knowledge by the Hidden Sage, you didn't
try it immediately?"

Condensed Matter shook his head. "When I received the related knowledge,
I was traveling---traveling with family; so I couldn't try it. Later, I
was infused with more knowledge and also traded for a grimoire, so I
forgot about it until remembering much later."

"I see..." Lumian's tone suddenly carried a hint of sighing.

This wasn't for Condensed Matter, but for Aurore.

He then said, "Can you describe what the contracted creature you
summoned looks like?"

Condensed Matter described his contracted creature's appearance in
detail, which was almost identical to the White Paper Lumian had
summoned.

"When you first summoned it, did it have slightly milky and pale yellow
clear liquid inside its body? It might have disappeared later," Lumian
asked as if confirming something.

Condensed Matter thought carefully before saying, "No."

"No..." Lumian sighed as if he had expected this.

He then said to Condensed Matter, "The one you summoned probably doesn't
have any problems."

"That's good, that's good!" Condensed Matter turned his head with
undisguised joy, glancing at Hela as if hoping this lady would endorse
this assessment.

At this point, Lumian added, "But I can't be completely certain yet.
There are still a few questions I need you to answer. This might involve
your privacy, but you don't need to be too detailed---I just need to
grasp the general situation."

After hesitating for a few seconds, influenced by multiple factors
including his desire for a definitive answer, the other party's
extraordinary charm, and Madame Hela's presence as witness, Condensed
Matter finally nodded and said, "Ask away."

Lumian sincerely said, "Thank you."

He then posed his question. "Which deity do you worship? If it's not one
of the orthodox gods, you don't need to answer."

Finding the question simpler and less awkward than imagined, Condensed
Matter quickly answered, "Eternal Blazing Sun."

*Eternal Blazing Sun... Is this the common point? On the surface,
they're all casual believers of the Eternal Blazing Sun... But surely
among the Warlocks in Trier like Professor and the others, there must be
some who praise the sun daily to conceal their identity... Are they
deliberately concealing it, not mentioning it? Also, Condensed Matter is
male, Aurore is female, so gender clearly isn't why the Hidden Sage
targeted her...* Lumian was initially pleased but quickly sank
into deep thought.

"How old were you when you transmigrated, and how old was the body after
transmigration?" Lumian further asked.

"My last memory was lamenting that I was almost thirty and had achieved
nothing," Condensed Matter for a moment before saying. "When I occupied
this body, he was just twenty-five."

*Different from Aurore's body state before and after
transmigration...* Lumian quickly considered which aspects he
should look for common points.

While thinking, he casually asked, "Are the current body's parents still
alive?"

"They passed away long ago," Condensed State answered concisely.

"Do you have children?" Lumian continued digging in this direction.

"Yes," Condensed Matter clearly didn't want to say more.

*There really aren't any common points with Aurore...* At this
moment, Lumian recalled something Condensed Matter had said earlier and
thought for two seconds before asking, "You said when you were infused
with the corresponding knowledge, you were traveling with family---which
family members?"

Condensed Matter still only spoke generally, "My wife, and my elder
sister's family."

"Elder sister..." Lumian's pupils suddenly dilated, as if he'd been
struck by lightning.

Condensed Matter nodded slightly. "Yes, the sister who raised this body
of mine."

Lumian stared at Condensed Matter, falling completely silent.

He felt he had found that key point.

The key point beyond the three words "Warlock," "transmigrator," and
"gray fog aura": Sister and brother!

Elder sister and younger brother!

Lumian began silently talking to himself.

He kept repeating two names.

*Omebella, Zedus...*

*Omebella, Zedus...*

Suddenly, Lumian remembered something else from the past.

When Madam Magician mentioned the empty baby cradle, she used the word
"lost."

This meant that in the eyes of this Angel who had a relatively deep
understanding of the Cordu Village incident, according to her spiritual
intuition, the cradle was empty because the child was "lost," which
wasn't exactly equivalent to death.

And the subsequent intelligence from Madame Pualis and everyone's
deductions indicated that baby Omebella had died early on, killed by her
father, her direct relative the padre.

At the time, neither Lumian nor Madam Magician thought there was
anything wrong with this---death was indeed a form of loss.

But now, Lumian had a new conjecture:

*Could it be that Madame Pualis didn't give birth to one child for the
padre, but to twins, a sister and brother?*

*Then, one was killed, one mysteriously disappeared, achieving some
purpose through the ritual of the Inevitability believers?*

*The killed baby Omebella has now returned to Madame Pualis's embrace
but can't come to reality yet---what about the mysteriously lost
child?*

Thinking of this, Lumian suddenly smiled.

He felt this might have something to do with himself.

He began to suspect that his selection of the Abscessed Hand profile
from such a large collection of spirit world creature materials, making
it the first creature for a Contractee to sign with, wasn't coincidental
but stemmed from some mystical connection.

Similarly, when he first arrived in Trier, his choice of the market
district and the Auberge du Coq Doré wasn't just because that's what the
deity worshiped by the Aurora Order arranged, but perhaps also because
of the Poison Spur Mob supported by the Nightstalkers there.

If this was true, then later meeting Father Montserrat and obtaining
Omebella's remaining umbilical cord was destined, an inevitable fate!

This also clarified why Madame Pualis had to find him specifically in
the dream city!

Ignoring Condensed Matter's surprised and confused gaze, Lumian
half-closed his eyes and silently said to himself, *Hand Bro, I'll bring
Omebella's remains to see you as soon as possible!*

Trier, fourth level of the catacombs.

Lumian held a lit white candle, accompanied by Jenna who also had
yellowish light spreading from her hands, as they walked step by step
toward the ancient tomb containing the Samaritan Women's Spring.

Before going to Morora to help Jenna advance to Demoness of Despair, he
wanted Jenna to meet with Krismona's shadow to see what changes might
occur or what hints they might receive.

"Can't Franca come here anymore?" Jenna asked curiously.

Lumian nodded. "After obtaining godhood, one should visit Trier's
underground---especially places like this---as little as possible.
Unless absolutely necessary, it's best not to come."

"Aren't you a demigod too?" Jenna asked, both amused and concerned.

Lumian chuckled. "It's different.

"For me, entering the catacombs feels as comfortable as returning home.

"If I weren't worried about making others nervous, I wouldn't even need
to light a candle."

He raised his right hand, exposing his palm with its pale skin, dark red
marks, and black pinhole to the cold air and candlelit dimness.

Then he blew out the candle in his hand, suddenly enveloped by darkness
with only Jenna's candlelight revealing his silhouette.

"Don't take risks!" Jenna was startled.

Lumian obligingly relit the candle with a smile.

"I was right, wasn't I?"

"You scared me to death!" Jenna glared at Lumian.

As they talked, they finally reached the ancient tomb chamber.

Lumian looked at the tomb door for two seconds and sighed.

"Too bad we didn't encounter Krismona's shadow on the way.

"I feel she's more friendly outside the Samaritan Women's Spring, while
inside she tends to be more..."

Lumian paused, then said in a low voice, "Evil."
