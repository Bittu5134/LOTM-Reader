## Chapter 838: Bluffing

Albus's right hand holding the weapon drooped down, seemingly too weak
to bear the weight of the bone and flesh sword. He planted it on the
ground made of corpses and bones, but compared to Lumian directly
dropping the Sword of Courage, he was clearly much better off.

At the same time, Celeste's voice, filled with anticipation and cruel
amusement, emanated from various mirrors and mirror-like objects
scattered across the corpse mountain and wasteland, "How are you
feeling? Confused about when you got infected with the disease?"

*Sure enough, it's a Demoness's Disease...* Standing on the
wasteland, Lumian took advantage of the moment before his muscles
completely lost strength, when he could still lift light objects, to
quickly remove the Devil's Whispers bone ring from his finger and stuff
it back into the Traveler's Bag.

Wearing this ring would cause Lumian to be constantly burned by
sulfurous flames, inside and out, continuously weakening his resistance
and tolerance to Disease. Although he was already poisoned by sulfur and
had some degree of burns, stopping the damage in time was still very
important.

After putting away the Devil's Whispers bone ring, Lumian took out the
brass talisman and matching earplugs given by Archbishop Heraberg,
gripping one in his left palm and putting the other back into his left
ear.

"Listen!" Lumian again uttered this ancient Hermes word, continuing his
learning process.

Meanwhile, Celeste's voice continued to emanate from various mirror
surfaces and mirror-like objects: "We were certain that the operation
targeting 0-01 would face interference and competition from Beyonders of
the Hunter pathway, and we would inevitably have to confront Wanak. So,
we prepared a Grade 1 Sealed Artifact in advance. The mystical pathogen
it produces has a very notable characteristic---it can survive in
high-temperature flames for a period of time.

"And I can use the power of the special mirror world to let those
pathogens spread quietly through different mirror surfaces, silently
dispersing throughout this wasteland and corpse mountain.

"You've been setting fires all along, but I've also been continuously
releasing frost, pretending to attack and curse. This actually freezes
those mystical pathogens inside, allowing them to survive longer in high
temperatures. Combined with their own special nature, it's enough for
you to be contaminated partially, slowly seeping into your bodies..."

Celeste explained in great detail, as if wanting to bring pain and savor
despair.

This might be her hobby, or perhaps a negative influence brought by
certain items.

Albus Medici, leaning on that bone and flesh sword, kept turning his
body, looking in different directions, seemingly trying to quickly
pinpoint Celeste's true form and drag her out of the mirror world.

However, it was impossible to discern which mirror Celeste was in just
from the source of the sound. She might have been constantly moving
through the mirror world without stopping.

Similarly, even if Albus recited those three passages of the honorific
name again, he could only affect the special mirror world in this area
at the peak of the corpse mountain. He couldn't damage the "mirrors" in
the middle and lower parts of the corpse mountain and on the wasteland.

Celeste's voice gradually became shrill, both painful and pleasurable.

"This pathogen also has flaws. It's not the type that will have fatal
effects in a short time. It can only make you quickly lose your physical
strength, accelerate the dissipation of spirituality, and eventually
make you lie on the ground, unable to move, desperately listening to
your own heart gradually weakening and stop beating."

Hearing this, Lumian teleported to change his position, avoiding being
assassinated by Celeste taking advantage of the situation.

Some thoughts flashed through his mind: *Could I wear the Eggers
family's golden mask to counteract the damage from this mystical
pathogen?*

*If I stop my heart from beating in advance, I won't have to worry about
it losing strength!*

*No, this mystical pathogen seems to affect the Spirit Body as well.
Perhaps, after physical death, the Spirit Body will gradually lose the
power to maintain its own existence...*

*Moreover, Archbishop Heraberg said that becoming a deceased here would
only lead to eternal slumber... Well, perhaps in the future, one might
be 'awakened' as a puppet of 0-01...*

Albus Medici at the peak of the corpse mountain suddenly laughed.

"So that's how it is. I do feel weakened.

"Even with my ancestor helping me share the impact, in three or four
minutes I should completely lose my fighting ability, barely able to
crawl.

"But I don't remember if I told you what I was going to do in the
underground mausoleum, or if you noticed that the abnormality had
already occurred?"

As he spoke, Albus's smile gradually brightened.

His demeanor was composed, appearing very confident and assured, not
panicked at all.

Celeste, who had been emitting sounds from different mirrors and
mirror-like objects to delay time until the effects of the mystical
pathogen deepened, suddenly fell silent.

She seemed to be observing her surroundings, trying to find the
abnormality Albus mentioned.

Albus moved his neck and said with an upturned corner of his mouth, "I
only have three things to accomplish here:

"First is to kill Wanak, so that 0-01 no longer has a proxy of this
level;

"Second is to recite my ancestor's honorific names around 0-01, causing
it to resonate and gradually awaken;

"Third, heh heh, is to delay time, waiting for 0-01 to break free from
this corpse mountain on its own.

"Haven't you noticed that the frequency and amplitude of 0-01's
trembling and shaking are getting higher and larger?

"Haven't you noticed that 0-01 is about to break free from the corpse
mountain?"

*Wh---* Celeste, hidden near the peak of the corpse mountain,
concealed in one of the components of the previous Mirror Maze to
closely observe Albus's movements and ready to interfere with the
target's self-rescue at any time, tensed up and instinctively looked
towards the violently shaking and trembling 0-01.

She then saw that charred banner with the dangerous blood spots densely
covering it.

Her head suddenly buzzed, and her neck ached.

She was further corrupted!

*Crack!*

The mirror where Celeste was hiding instantly shattered, revealing her
figure, with a blank expression, her head trying to separate from her
neck.

*Now!* Albus seized the opportunity, discarding the heavy bone
and flesh sword, transforming into a blazing white, blue-tinged flame
spear, swooshing down near Celeste.

Then, he created a dense Fog of War, enveloping Celeste and the area
within about ten meters around this Demoness.

After completing this, Albus didn't give Celeste a chance to break free
from her corrupted state and escape the Fog of War through the mirror
world. Mustering his remaining strength, he condensed several blue
fireballs and sent them crashing into the Fog of War one after another.

*Rumble!*

Relatively violent explosions occurred, and pale blue flames rose up.
Celeste's Mirror Substitution was passively triggered.

But affected and misled by the Fog of War, her figure reappeared still
within the blast range, still covered by shock waves powerful enough to
destroy a Demoness's body.

Albus controlled the power of the fireballs, ensuring the Fog of War was
never dispersed, causing Celeste's Mirror Substitutions to shatter one
after another.

Similarly, he also controlled the frequency of fireballs bombarding that
small area of fog, not giving Celeste even a slight chance to recover
and enter the mirror world.

Finally, Celeste's shadow froze. That beautiful and seductive body
blackened and disintegrated, falling to the ground in the form of corpse
fragments.

*Plop*, the black teardrop-shaped ornament she had been wearing
on her brow fell onto a corpse.

Albus stopped maintaining the Fog of War and looked at the dead Celeste,
laughing mockingly.

"Oh, I forgot to tell you, my calmness just now was feigned. I needed to
delay for five to six minutes to wait for 0-01 to resonate with my
ancestor to the extreme, initially awaken, and break free from the
constraints of the corpse mountain.

"Why were you in such a hurry? So hurried that you forgot direct eye
contact with 0-01 would lead to corruption, and you were already
corrupted to some extent.

"Remember, being too hasty or too slow are both major taboos in war."

While mocking the dead, Albus didn't go to pick up that black
teardrop-shaped ornament which clearly possessed Beyonder power, fearing
it might trigger corresponding negative effects and impact subsequent
matters, especially since he was already considerably weakened.

At this point, his hands and feet had become powerless, running had
become difficult, so he could only transform again into a blazing white,
blue-tinged flame spear, flying back near 0-01.

He glanced at Julie's filthy blood slowly falling in mid-air, estimating
it was only about 30-40 centimeters away from the target.

Albus then threw a blue fireball at it, burning that pool of filthy
blood, causing it to slowly evaporate and dissipate without triggering
any additional changes.

After closing his eyes to sense the frequency and amplitude of 0-01's
shaking and trembling, Albus silently said to himself, *It seems to be
progressing faster than expected, two or three more minutes should be
enough.*

*Heh heh, Celeste, I lied about one thing earlier. In the end, 0-01
still can't break free on its own, it needs me to help it with Medici
family blood...*

*I didn't mock your corpse earlier because I had too much time, some
words needed to be heard by Lumian Lee, to make him overlook the part
where I lied...*

Albus Medici then turned to look at the wasteland, at Lumian who had
just completed a teleportation to change his position to avoid being
locked onto, and said loudly with a laugh, "You're very alert. In such a
pressing situation, you actually didn't follow that fool Celeste to
observe the abnormalities of 0-01."

Lumian raised his hand to scratch his right ear, telling a lie that
couldn't be more obvious,

"Sorry, I was learning, I didn't hear your conversation just now.
Alright, I admit, I was thinking Celeste would help me confirm the
current situation of 0-01."

Albus looked at this guy and said thoughtfully, "You're very calm. Your
physical combat ability should be almost depleted by now. As for me,
with my ancestor sharing the burden, I can definitely hold out longer
than you."

Lumian laughed, laughing with composure and confidence, exuding the
brilliance of a top student. "Haven't you noticed that there are other
abnormalities here?"
