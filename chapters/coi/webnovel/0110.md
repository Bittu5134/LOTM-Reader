## Chapter 110: Foreigner

*For you are dust, and to dust you shall return*---From the
Bible, Genesis 3:19

The imposing grayish-white city wall, rising to a height of three
meters, loomed before Lumian, stretching as far as the eye could see.

A multitude of private carriages, four-seaters, open tops, tandems, and
cargo carriers queued, awaiting entry through the city gate.

Blue-uniformed tax collectors and white-shirted, black-vested police
officers inspected each carriage methodically. Occasionally, they would
demand identification or order pedestrians to open their suitcases.

Lumian, clutching his brown suitcase, scanned the scene, casting furtive
glances as he sought a way to bypass the checkpoint.

Before long, a man who had observed his behavior approached.

"What's the matter, friend? You look a bit uneasy." The man was somewhat
shorter than Lumian but twice as broad. His cheeks were plump, causing
his blue eyes to appear minuscule.

As he neared, Lumian caught a whiff of sweat mingled with cheap cologne,
prompting him to wrinkle his nose in distaste.

Lumian gestured toward the gates, puzzled, and inquired, "What's all
this for? Are they searching for criminals? Why screen those entering
Trier and not the ones leaving?"

The disheveled, blond-haired man in a billowy blue shirt appraised
Lumian.

"My friend, are you from some small city or village?"

Upon seeing Lumian nod, the man sighed and explained, "They're
collecting taxes! Tariffs!"

"Tariffs for entering Trier?" Lumian asked.

The man nodded.

"Exactly. This city wall encircles Trier. There are 54 gates, each
manned by tax collectors and police. They also apprehend wanted
criminals."

"Are all goods taxed?" Lumian inquired, curiosity piqued.

The man touched his blue canvas shirt and replied, "Almost everything;
only grains and flour are exempt.

"Once upon a time they were, but after the war a few years back, the
price of bread in Trier skyrocketed, inciting riots and protests.
Eventually, the government abolished tariffs on all food.

"Ah, if only drinkers were as bold! Liquor, wine, and champagne are
taxed the most. Many people venture to the suburbs on weekends to drink
tax-free alcohol at small taverns. They call it 'town-hopping.'"

"Interesting..." Lumian nodded thoughtfully.

The man glanced around and lowered his voice.

"If you want to avoid the tariffs, I can help you into the city. All you
have to do is pay me a small fee."

"You mean bribe them?" Lumian gestured with his chin at the tax
collector and police near the city gate.

The man snorted.

"Their greed is greater than an elephant's appetite. I'll show you a
path into the city without checkpoints."

"But isn't Trier completely surrounded by walls?" Lumian didn't conceal
his bafflement.

The man grinned.

"You'll see soon enough." Then he teased, "Noble sir, do you require my
assistance?"

Lumian considered for a moment before asking, "How much will it cost?"

"Three verl d'or," the man replied with a congenial smile. "If you
agree, we can depart immediately. You can pay once we're inside the
city."

"Deal." Lumian adjusted his dark wide-brimmed hat, picked up his brown
suitcase, and followed the rotund man away from the city gate.

Fifteen minutes later, they arrived at a hill blanketed in vegetation
and soil, with grayish-white stones peeking through.

Scaffolding, decaying pillowwood, and numerous pits were scattered
about. It appeared to be an abandoned mine.

The rotund man guided Lumian through heaps of jumbled rocks to the
entrance of a mine.

"Is this the shortcut?" Lumian asked cautiously.

The portly man in the blue shirt chuckled.

"You really don't know much about Trier.

"Ever heard the saying that Underground Trier is even larger than the
Trier above ground?!"

"No." Lumian shook his head.

The man elucidated, "Trier used to be much smaller. It was surrounded by
quarries that supplied stone for building the city. As the population
swelled, the city had to expand outward, enveloping these quarries. As a
result, the ground became riddled with holes and mine tunnels.

"Add to that the portion of Trier that sank underground in the Fourth
Epoch, plus the sewers, subways, and gas pipes installed by the
government---aren't these more extensive than what's on the surface?"

Lumian's eyes widened in understanding.

"Are you taking me into the city through Underground Trier?"

"Yes." The man turned, stooped, and entered the mine. He casually
inquired, "What should I call you?"

"Ciel." Lumian brushed back the golden hair at his temples. "And you?"

"Just call me Ramayes." The burly man rummaged through a pile of stones
in the mine's corner and unearthed an iron-black lantern.

Clearly made of metal, the rusted lantern was cylindrical, with the
upper section slightly narrower than the lower. A black rubber lining
encircled its base.

At the junction of the narrow and wide cylinders, a polished
trumpet-shaped metal piece was embedded, though a few rust spots
remained.

Ramayes produced a matchbox, fiddled with it briefly, and an orange
flame tinged with blue erupted from the metal trumpet, illuminating the
mine's depths.

"What's this?" Lumian asked, puzzled.

Holding the iron-black lamp, Ramayes ventured underground, chattering.

"Carbide lamp.

"Invented by the Cave Association. Many miners use it. I don't know why
it glows, but I just need to put some rocks and water in, attach them
top and bottom, and when needed, press here and ignite the mouth with
flames."

Carbide and water react to form acetylene, which burns and emits light?
Lumian recalled the chemistry he'd studied a few months prior.

He remained silent for a time as he followed Ramayes underground along a
disused mine tunnel. Then he inquired, "The Cave Association?"

"Trier Cave Association. Formed by a group of spelunking enthusiasts.
Nowadays, they seem to be involved with the mines." Ramayes turned to
Lumian, walking beside him, and asked with a grin, "Why didn't you just
take the steam locomotive into Trier? The train station checkpoints
aren't that strict. They just do spot checks."

Lumian reminisced and replied, "I wanted to experience the last vestiges
of romance from the classical era."

"A courier carriage?" Ramayes chortled. "That's far pricier than a steam
locomotive. Your accent gives you away as from the Reem or Riston
region. The journey from the south to Trier runs about 120 verl d'or,
doesn't it? And it takes four and a half days! On a steam locomotive,
you'd pay less than 50 verl d'or for a third-class seat and arrive in
under 20 hours. So, the last bit of romance from the classical era, you
say? Sounds more like a con job for folks like you. You must've shelled
out a pretty penny, huh?"

Lumian responded candidly, "A fair amount. I've only got 267 verl d'or
left."

Ramayes glanced at him once more and averted his eyes.

*What a waste...*

Clutching the carbide lamp, he traversed an archway and veered into
another passage bathed in the orange-yellow glow cast by the lamp's
flame.

Lumian glanced up and noticed rocks nestled in the darkness overhead,
adorned with moss that wept droplets of water.

The path underfoot was pockmarked with holes, and stone pillars flanked
both sides, supporting the cave's ceiling.

Stones and various objects were heaped between the pillars, creating a
"street" wide enough for six or seven people to walk abreast.

Under the carbide lamp's illumination, a steel nameplate affixed to a
stone pillar came into view. Inscribed on it in Intis: "Rue à Droite."

"There's a street name down here?" Lumian queried, puzzled.

Gripping the carbide lamp, Ramayes chuckled and replied, "Didn't I tell
you? This is Underground Trier.

"In fact, it was constructed decades ago during city renovations. The
brass deemed the underground too chaotic, a veritable labyrinth.
Rioters, murderers, smugglers, and cultists all found refuge here, and
something had to be done. Additionally, numerous houses had crumbled and
sunk due to the underground quarries. Reinforcement was necessary. So,
City Hall spent nearly a decade repairing pillars, constructing
foundations, and connecting the previously isolated quarries,
subterranean ruins, catacombs, and sewers.

"To prevent workers from getting lost, the underground streets were
named to correspond with those above during the renovations. Roads,
squares, and alleys were recreated down here, and nameplates were hung,
marking the streets. If future repairs were needed, the names could just
be referenced."

"In other words," Lumian gestured overhead with his free hand. "The real
Rue à Droite is just above us?"

"Yes." Ramayes pressed on. "This is Underground Trier. There's an
anti-smuggling wall up ahead. Quarry police often patrol the area, but
don't fret. I'll guide you through a small tunnel. Heh, the brass, with
their phony collars and lies, believe they can manage Underground Trier
like they do above ground, but they're only aware of half the entrances
and modified routes..."

As he spoke, he led Lumian to a dead end and located a narrow crevice to
crawl through. Lumian trailed closely.

Two or three minutes later, they emerged from the small tunnel. Before
them stood a "wall" composed of stone pillars and a "street" wedged
between.

Just then, a burly figure appeared beside the stone pillar, holding a
carbide lamp, and addressed Ramayes, "Is this our customer?"

Ramayes spun around and grinned at Lumian.

"Foreigner, I've changed my mind. The price is 265 verl d'or. Wasn't I
generous to leave you enough for bread and a motel tonight?"

"What if I refuse?" Lumian's face displayed a mix of fear and defiance.

Ramayes's chubby face quivered with laughter.

"What do you think will happen? Didn't your mother warn you not to trust
strangers too easily when you're away from home?"

He and the burly man closed in on Lumian from opposite directions.

Lumian smiled, set down the suitcase, and advanced towards Ramayes and
his accomplice.

In the flickering firelight, over ten seconds swiftly ticked by, and the
carbide lamp ended up in Lumian's possession.

Lumian crouched beside the trembling Ramayes, his face battered and
swollen, and pulled all the banknotes from his wallet. In the dim orange
and blue light, he counted them with grave intent.

Gently patting Ramayes's right cheek with the wad of cash, Lumian
grinned.

"Now there's only 319 verl d'or left."

With that, he pocketed the banknotes and strolled toward a path that
appeared to lead up to the surface.

A nameplate dangled from a stone pillar, inscribed with two lines of
Intisian script: "Rue du Pot de Chambre, Le Marché du Quartier du
Gentleman."

Someone had scratched out 'Rue du Pot de Chambre' with a stone and
scrawled a new name beside it: "Rue Anarchie."
