## Chapter 1059: Zedus

Lumian had advanced too quickly and hadn't yet mastered many mystical
languages. He had only learned part of Jotun so far, but he had a
contractual connection with the Abscessed Hand, allowing him to directly
understand the meaning through the thoughts transmitted by the other
party.

At that moment, he was completely stunned by the Abscessed Hand's
reaction and words.

He had originally imagined that after thousands of years, the reunion of
brother and sister would be sad yet heartwarming, like when Hand Bro had
just become a 0-01 soldier and called out the name "Omebella" with such
depth.

Instead, there was not a trace of warmth, only bone-deep hatred.

As the Abscessed Hand's voice echoed, the area around Him lit up, as if
crimson moonlight was falling from an unknown place onto this
wilderness---evil, cold, and bloody.

Then, within the crimson moonlight, one after another illusory and
complex Doors of Summoning split open, connecting to different places,
with some indescribable horror growing behind them.

On the wilderness ground, countless plants sprouted, creeping toward the
withered trunk that had evolved from Omebella's remains.

The Gift of the Land, stimulated by this, also reacted, with the soil
below splitting apart, leaving nothing growing.

This power, rich with death and return, met the lush scene of new life.

Standing between Omebella's remains and the Abscessed Hand, Lumian was
instantly affected, uncontrollably regressing into a mirror that cracked
with a snap.

This influence continued to expand rapidly, not giving Lumian, who was
trying to redraw his silhouette, a moment's peace.

At this moment, streams of invisible flames shot up from various parts
of the wilderness, the sky above taking on the color of burning, as a
terrifying will that could conquer everything suddenly descended.

The flesh in the middle of the Abscessed Hand's brow writhed, pulling at
the skin.

The distortion of His face quickly returned to normal, and around Him,
whether it was the crimson moonlight, the numerous Doors of Summoning,
or the various newly grown plants, all instantly vanished.

The Sealed Artifact Gift of the Land also returned to silence, the
desolation no longer spreading.

As the invisible flames extinguished, this blood-stained wilderness
before the mountain of corpses was once again shrouded in darkness.

Lumian looked toward the peak of the corpse mountain and couldn't help
muttering, "Boss, aren't you being a bit too hasty?"

He had wanted to observe for a while longer before using 0-01's power
and authority to suppress the Abscessed Hand and the Gift of the Land,
but unexpectedly, 0-01 had reacted to the stress.

This left him quite helpless.

However, there was nothing he could do about it---after all, 0-01 was
the boss, and he was just the proxy.

And 0-01 was actually in a state of deep sleep, reacting purely on
instinct, not something Lumian could "persuade" even if he wanted to.

Confirming Hand Bro's reaction and hearing those words is enough. Some
of my previously unclear thoughts and speculations have either been
overturned or connected...

*Heh heh, Hand Bro, should I call you Zedus from now on?*

Lumian muttered for a while, then put away the Gift of the Land which
had been suppressed and become quiet, with no random effects likely to
appear for some time, and teleported back to the square in front of the
Church of Knowledge.

Here, wailing and groaning were everywhere, with many having already
lost their lives.

Lumian swept his gaze around, quickly left Morora, and appeared back in
the area behind the mirror, appearing beside Franca.

At this time, Jenna had just completed her advancement, her hair
slightly darker and thicker, her eyes an even more beautiful blue.

"Where's Madam Magician?" Lumian took his gaze off Jenna and asked
Franca.

Franca made a tongue-clicking sound and chuckled.

"After confirming there were no problems with Jenna's advancement, she
went back to work on her manuscript.

"She said if you have any findings or speculations, either summon her
messenger or report directly to Mr. Fool."

"This time I'll need a signed book." Lumian laughed, then said to Franca
and Jenna, "Let's go to the New City of Silver first."

___

After returning the Gift of the Land to the room at the bottom of the
spire, Lumian went to the Church of Fool headquarters and entered the
confessional that Mr. Sun had specially prepared for him and the others.

He immediately created a ball of blazing white flame, letting the light
fill every inch of space inside the confessional, then began telling
Franca, Jenna, and Mr. Sun, who had come specially to listen, about his
"brother-sister" speculation, the names Omebella and Zedus, the
Abscessed Hand's recent reaction and His spoken words.

"You mean Omebella and Zedus are both children of the Great Mother,'the
former being the elder sister who inherited the power of the Earth
pathway, and the latter being the brother on the neighboring Moon
pathway, and they were possibly twins?" Franca tried to sort out the
logic.

At this point, Jenna's face showed a grave expression. "Zedus was killed
by Omebella, for unknown reasons?"

"Perhaps with the help of Omebella's husband, the ancient god---Giant
King Aurmir. They were worried about Zedus's resurrection, so they
deliberately dismembered Him into multiple pieces and sealed them in
different places. This is also why the Sanguine never heard of such an
Angel of the Moon pathway.

"Yes, this event probably happened quite early, before that Sanguine
ancestor partially regained consciousness in the Second Epoch and became
an ancient god. I've been saying, it doesn't make sense that there was
only a Sanguine ancestor in the Second Epoch. Since one of the Sequences
in the Beyonder characteristics is called Vampire, there should have
been Vampires as creatures in the early Second Epoch, or even the First
Epoch, regardless of whether they had rationality or were completely
equivalent to monsters---this doesn't affect the essential definition,"
Lumian spoke slowly, thinking as he talked.

Mr. Sun offered an explanation on behalf of the Sanguine, "The Sanguine
don't consider such monsters as their kin."

"So it's Sanguine ancestor, not Vampire ancestor?" Lumian thought that
if Mr. Moon were present, there might be some unpleasant incidents.

After one divine assembly and one small gathering, he had gained a
preliminary understanding of Mr. Moon's personality and concerns.

Mr. Sun answered very fairly, "That's what they call it."

*But you people of the New City of Silver think vampires and the
Sanguine are essentially the same?* Lumian, Franca, and Jenna,
all three Demonesses, could hear what Mr. Sun left unsaid.

*What a considerate person...* Lumian sighed inwardly before
continuing, "Before His death, Zedus cursed His sister Omebella, cursing
Her to die by the hand of Her direct descendant, and this curse came
true."

At this point, Lumian suddenly paused, and after two seconds, said in a
low voice, "Zedus, as an Angel of the Moon pathway, was killed by
Omebella of the Earth pathway, who might have also stolen His identity,
while Omebella ultimately died at the hands of the Sanguine ancestor, an
ancient god of the Moon pathway who might no longer have had true god
status at the time, and then had Her identity stolen.

"This is an inevitability..."

Lumian felt profound emotion.

When he had stolen the power of Inevitability, he had no clear
understanding, but the more he learned, the more he felt that
inevitability was an issue that even Angels, true gods, and great beings
couldn't avoid.

After discussing for a while longer, Lumian stood up and said, "I need
to report to Mr. Fool; he might provide new revelations."

He began praying right there in the confessional.

Suddenly, thin grayish-white fog appeared before his eyes, and his ears
seemed to hear terrifying chaotic sounds.

In just the blink of an eye, Lumian saw himself sitting at the bronze
long table, in the position representing the Chariot, while at the head
of the long table, in that huge stone chair, Mr. Fool's figure, wearing
a top hat and coat, was faintly visible, hidden in the mist.

"Good morning, Mr. Fool." Lumian immediately stood up and bowed.

He had intended to report to Mr. Fool through prayer but was directly
pulled up to the gray fog instead.

The Fool nodded slightly, his voice carrying more gentleness than the
coldness of the last gathering.

"You have found the answer?"

Lumian sat down. "I have become a Demoness of Unaging, borrowed the Gift
of the Land, and went to see the Abscessed Hand in the depths of
Morora..."

After repeating Mr. Fool's previous revelation, he shared all the
information he had collected and all his speculations, finally asking,
"Mr. Fool, did Madame Pualis deliberately hide the infant Zedus in Cordu
to use the ritual that the Inevitability believers would ultimately
perform?

"Was the infant Zedus's mysterious disappearance due to that ritual?"

The Fool, shrouded in thin gray fog, nodded. "Yes."

Lumian suddenly smiled, laughing for several seconds.

Then, he sighed and asked seriously, "Mr. Fool, the infant Zedus's soul
fragments are within my body, right?"

Since the one worshiped by the Aurora Order could use that ritual and
Mr. Fool's seal to let Amon return within the barrier undetected and
steal Termiboros's power and identity, the Great Mother could do
something similar!

The infant Zedus must have also been in the destruction brought by the
ritual at that time, like other villagers of Cordu, shattered into
pieces, with only fragments of soul remaining, which were then sealed
inside my body!

That's how he mysteriously disappeared.

The Fool placed his right hand on the edge of the long table and rapped
it gently. "Yes."

Lumian gave a self-deprecating smile. "No wonder I encountered matters
related to the Great Mother as soon as I reached Trier, met the priest
who had nurtured Omebella as soon as I went to sea, and the first
contract creature I selected was the Abscessed Hand..."

He sighed softly for a few moments, then looked back at the table before
The Fool.

"Mr. Fool, can you help me remove the seal and separate the infant
Zedus's soul fragment?"

The Fool said in an even voice, "Like Aurore's soul fragments, he has
already merged with you."

Lumian was stunned for a moment, shocked yet feeling this was natural.

The special quality possessed by Aurore's soul fragment was obviously
also possessed by the infant Zedus's soul fragment.

The two of them were different from other villagers---if one had merged,
the other would certainly not be an exception.

"Will he affect Aurore's resurrection?" Lumian asked the question he
cared about most.

The Fool shook his head slightly. "He has a different gender from
Aurore; he will only replace you in the future.

"He merged with you when you obtained Omebella's bloodline."

"Zedus's soul fragment, Omebella's bloodline, heh heh, I alone am
equivalent to divine twins." Lumian exhaled and sincerely asked, "Mr.
Fool, is there a way to resolve this issue?"

The Fool looked at Lumian for several seconds, his voice suddenly
becoming somewhat drifting, as if narrating fate, "This is a hidden
danger, a risk, and also a variable, an opportunity."
