## Chapter 903: Everything's Familiar

After the platform had disappeared from view, Lumian observed the
conditions inside the train carriage.

The seats were made of wood, the windows were narrow, and the lighting
was insufficient. The other passengers seemed to be conversing, but
there was no sound, as if they were performing a silent play.

Jenna and Anthony, experiencing something like this for the first time,
were also quietly examining their surroundings. Ludwig was painfully yet
intently eating imaginary delicious snacks, while Franca was in low
spirits, leaning against the carriage and gazing at the scenery outside.

Vast pastures and lush fields were quickly receding, interspersed with
old castles and quaint villages, beautiful like an oil painting.

Gradually, Franca saw palaces formed of frost, houses flying above the
clouds, and pairs of crystal shoes dancing in a distant square...

The scenery outside the steam train began to become dreamlike, as if
various fairy tales were merging together.

Before long, the iron-black steam locomotive entered the fog, and
nothing could be seen clearly outside the windows.

Lumian, Franca, and the others instinctively gripped their lucky coins
tightly. No one spoke, maintaining silence, worried that any unnecessary
movement might prevent them from entering Mr. Fool's dream.

In the thick, dream-like fog, the iron-black steam locomotive that had
emerged from fantasy continued to race forward with a clanking sound.

At some point, Lumian felt the clanking of the train wheels hitting the
rail joints grow fainter and fainter until it disappeared.

Suddenly, they heard a female voice: "Does anyone want anything? Boxed
meals, snacks, ice cream, beverages, local specialties, beef jerky..."

Franca sat up straight, her expression both shocked and bewildered.

She abruptly stood up, turned around, and looked towards the entrance of
the carriage. She saw a woman wearing a white shirt and a purple-red
long dress, with a small purple-red soft hat, pushing a multi-layered
metal cart towards them.

The cart had colorful items arranged on different levels, beverages in
peculiar bottles, and stacked boxed meals.

*Wh---* Franca's gaze instinctively swept to both sides of the
multi-layered cart, finding that the previously shadowy passengers had
become very clear. They were wearing clothes that often appeared in her
dreams, either quietly spending time on different brands of phones or
conversing softly with companions, with occasional sounds of children
crying.

This was a scene Franca had dreamed of seeing again, but encountering it
at this moment, in this setting, made her shiver with an inexplicable
fear.

*Is this, is this Mr. Fool's dream?*

"What's wrong?" Lumian stood up as well, asking in a low voice.

He had already noticed the changes in the carriage, even the seats and
backrests had become soft, as if wrapped in thick, blue-dyed cotton.

He also noticed that the passengers' clothing, style, and way of
speaking were distinctly different from his group.

But this wasn't the reason for Franca's dramatic change in expression.

*This is a dream, after all. Nothing should be surprising!*

Franca's lips quivered a few times. She looked back at Anthony, who was
sitting in the row in front with Ludwig, then lowered her voice and said
to Lumian and Jenna, "It's exactly the same as a similar scene from my
world..."

Lumian immediately understood why Franca had reacted that way earlier.
He deliberately said in a nonchalant tone, "Have you forgotten about the
Celestial Worthy? He also comes from that world. Isn't it normal for
corresponding scenes to appear in a dream He's involved in?"

"You're right..." Franca showed a self-deprecating smile. "I was too
excited, too scared, and overlooked this point."

*Indeed, this is very normal!*

*This is also the sleeping dream of that Celestial Worthy!*

Jenna also stood up, looked around for a few seconds, and said, "So,
does this mean we've entered Mr. Fool's dream?"

As she spoke, she opened her right palm and found that beneath the shiny
lucky coin was a train ticket that read: "Ningbei---Yangdu"

Although Jenna only recognized the numbers on the ticket, it didn't
prevent her from understanding the meaning of those strange characters.
Similarly, the passengers sitting across the aisle understood her
Intisian, turning their heads to look at them curiously. However, upon
noticing their strange attire, they seemed to find it normal and turned
away.

According to Madam Magician's previous explanation, in Mr. Fool's dream,
there was no need to worry about language barriers or unfamiliar text.
This was essentially communicating with Mr. Fool's subconscious, and Mr.
Fool knew all languages.

Of course, being able to intuitively understand the meaning of
unfamiliar text didn't mean one could comprehend it deeply. Jenna had
been worried about this issue before, but Madam Magician had reassured
them. Now, Jenna finally understood why Madam Magician wasn't concerned
about this problem:

These characters were familiar to Franca, and she could serve as the
most reliable translator!

"It should be," Lumian cautiously put away the lucky coin, holding only
the train ticket.

After noticing that other passengers could understand their speech,
Jenna asked Franca in a very low voice, "What are those things the
people are holding?"

*They look very strange...*

Lumian immediately used the Bottle of Fiction to enclose their two rows
of seats, using the window as support, but keeping the barrier
transparent.

Franca suddenly became energetic, completely forgetting her previous
dejection and shock. She introduced with a smile,

"Those are cell phones, products of scientific development. They
integrate telegraph communication, theatrical performance, mirror
messaging, and other effects. They have even more functions that you
can't imagine. Later, I'll get a few and teach you how to use them in
detail. It's too difficult to explain clearly now!"

As she spoke, Franca's face was full of pride. "That's a T-shirt, those
are jeans, those are sneakers..."

Just as she said this, Ludwig started shouting, "I want a boxed meal, I
want snacks, I want ice cream, I want beverages, I want beef jerky!"

The little boy was salivating, completely forgetting the fact that food
in dreams was all imaginary.

"Uh, Madam Magician reminded us to try to obey the law," Franca looked
at Lumian. "I remember there was cash in the envelope Madam Justice gave
us."

Lumian opened the envelope and took out a stack of brand new, bright red
banknotes, and deactivated the Bottle of Fiction.

"Two thousand per person," he told his companions.

"That's okay." Franca nodded, then looked at Ludwig with a worried
expression. "This child's meal expenses for one day would probably be
over a thousand..."

And that's assuming he didn't eat anything good!

"There will always be ways to make money." Lumian spent two hundred to
get five boxed meals.

Franca hesitated for a moment and said, "Let's give them all to Ludwig.
Although I'd love to relive the taste of familiar food, we shouldn't
waste money here. There will be better choices later."

After piling all five boxed meals in front of Ludwig, Jenna asked in a
low voice, "Can we look at Mr. Fool's identity information in the dream
now?"

She noticed that many passengers around were sneaking glances at her and
Franca, so she sat back down.

Lumian considered for a moment and said, "We haven't reached our
destination yet. Let's wait a bit longer. We'll look at it after we get
off at our destination station."

*Caution is paramount!*

As he spoke, Lumian took out a mirror and tossed it into the gap between
Ludwig and the backrest.

He was using mirror illusion magic to conceal the exaggerated situation
of Ludwig being able to eat five boxed meals in one go and still only be
half full.

He had noticed earlier that someone was secretly pointing what Franca
called a phone in their direction. His spiritual intuition told him it
would be better not to let abnormal matters appear in front of the
public.

"Doesn't this train make any clanking noises?" Jenna and Franca started
chatting casually.

Franca said with a boastful tone, "Of course not, this is the latest
train model, and it's incredibly fast!"

She pointed to the display screen at the front of the carriage, which
showed the real-time speed using numbers and symbols familiar to Jenna.

*Thank you, Emperor Roselle!*

Franca enthusiastically explained all the details that confused Lumian,
Jenna, and Anthony, occasionally correcting their misconceptions, such
as:

"Is this place even more open than Trier? I see people can expose their
arms and legs..."

"No, no, no, we're far behind Trier. This is just freedom of dressing,
and it doesn't offend others in public places. It's a manifestation of
being cultured and civilized. In private, it's not as open as Trier at
all!"

"Won't our current appearance be too strange?"

"Don't worry, just say we're going to a comic convention!"

"What's a comic convention?"

"..."

During this exchange, the train finally emerged from the fog, and a
magnificent city with countless towering buildings appeared ahead. Each
of these buildings seemed to rival mountains in height, their surfaces
covered with glass curtain walls that gleamed golden in the sunlight.

Lumian and Jenna instinctively held their breath, as if approaching the
realm of gods.

It was a miracle on earth, a city on the mountain top!

Franca also stopped her explanation, her lake-blue eyes fixed on the
city, her expression a mix of nostalgia and sadness.

The train gradually slowed down, entered the city, and finally stopped
at a clean, bright, and spacious platform.

The other passengers in this carriage suddenly disappeared, as if the
dream weaver could no longer maintain them. Lumian and Franca exchanged
glances with the others, then led Ludwig off the train, followed by the
"strangely dressed" Jenna, Franca, and Anthony.

Along with the numerous passengers from other carriages, they took
self-operating escalators to leave the platform. Under the guidance of
their "guide" Franca, they made their way out of the station to the
square outside, with no one speaking along the way.

Seeing the surrounding people gradually dispersing and the area becoming
more open, Lumian took out the brownish-yellow envelope given by Madam
Justice. He extracted the documents related to Mr. Fool's dream identity
and spread them out for his companions to see.

Franca immediately saw a name written in her native language at the top
of the document: "Zhou Mingrui."
