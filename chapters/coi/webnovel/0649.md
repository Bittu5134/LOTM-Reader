## Chapter 649: Conspiracy Showcase

*Sufficient distance and a Hypnotist...* Hisoka repeated
Lumian's words as if he had realized something.

Lumian stood in front of him, looking down, and questioned, "Do you
think that, apart from Demon Hunters and higher-level Beyonders of the
corresponding pathway, Devils mainly get killed based on chance
encounters in battles?"

Hisoka regarded Lumian with indifference and remained silent.

Lumian pulled up a chair and sat down, crossing his right foot over his
left knee. Casually, he said, "I've read a mysticism book about Devils.
It's filled with numerous cases of hunting Devils.

"It's clear that Beyonders of most pathways rely on chance encounters to
kill specific Devils. That's what I believed back then. However, when I
revisited the detailed description of Devil abilities, I found a
contradiction.

"This is how the mysticism book describes your Danger Premonition:

"Danger Premonition, also known as Malicious Perception---if an enemy
can soon cause lethal harm to a Devil and takes clear action to do so, a
Devil can sense the danger in advance and grasp the source. They can
target it, kill it, take revenge, or escape, but it's impossible to know
the exact details of the plan. Different Devils have different intuition
ranges---from a few minutes to a day, from a few kilometers to as wide
as a city."

"What's the contradiction between this and a battle encounter?" Hisoka
asked, sitting upright, cold and curious.

"According to this description, Devils can indeed sense a battle
encounter," Lumian said with a smile. "For example, even though I only
intended to have a cup of coffee today and suddenly encountered a Devil,
and had no choice but to kill him. For that Devil, it's literal. He
should have sensed that my coffee-drinking at the café would pose a
fatal danger to him in advance and that it would happen, but that's not
the case in reality."

Observing Hisoka's thoughtful expression, Lumian clasped his hands
together.

"This means that a Devil's Danger Premonition doesn't stem from fate. If
it were a powerful Beyonder of the Monster pathway, there's a high
chance they would suddenly feel that coffee isn't suitable today and
avoid danger. But you can't.

"Since a Devil's Danger Premonition doesn't stem from precognition of
fate, where does it stem from?

"Once, a high-ranking Demon enlightened me about the concept of the
Abyss. According to its perspective, the Abyss holds two dimensions. The
first is physical, with an entrance hidden somewhere in the real world.
The second is in the mind, with an entrance nestled deep within
everyone's hearts.

"Considering this insight, I believe we need to tweak the foundation of
a Devil's Danger Premonition.

"It kicks in only when an adversary has a well-defined plan capable of
inflicting fatal harm on a Devil soon. That's when the Devil can sense
it beforehand.

"Got it? A more distinct thought process or intent."

Lumian adopted the cadence of Madam Magician to taunt Hisoka, weaving
the narrative of his conspiracy.

"In the beginning, I probed bit by bit and investigated step by step.
When I stumbled upon crucial information, I purposely skirted around it,
leaving me in the dark about who I was dealing with and without a rough
plan to handle the target.

"In simpler terms, I didn't have clear thoughts or intentions, and there
was no effective plan to cause lethal harm to you anytime soon.
Everything was vague, chaotic, and uncommitted, filled with variation
and accidents, ensuring you couldn't naturally sense danger.

"However, your position alerted you when I delved into the serial murder
from four years ago. Since then, you've been using a Wraith's ability
and the patrol team members under your control to keep a vigilant eye on
this matter, right?"

Hisoka listened coldly, showing no intention of responding.

Lumian smiled and continued, "After figuring out that you were hiding in
the patrol team as a Zombie Sequence Beyonder, I resisted my urges and
tried my best not to dwell on such matters. When I returned to the
hotel, I immediately teleported to Trier.

"At this distance, you won't be able to sense that I'm formulating a
plan and putting it into practice.

"After coming up with a preliminary plan, I went to Hidden Blade and my
two other companions to discuss a detailed plan. It was just past 7 p.m.
Trier time.

"The next move involved assigning tasks. Each of us had a role to play.
We underwent a Hypnotist's Hypnotism, erasing our true purpose from
memory. Only when a Devil like you emerged would we recall the specific
details.

"My mission was to use teleportation, making it seem like I left, only
to return stealthily using shadow concealment. I trailed the patrol team
member I interacted with, believing that I was checking if there was
anything problematic with him.

"Hidden Blade's mission was to tail me, providing necessary vigilance
and support. If I activated the Bottle of Fiction ability, she'd
preemptively don the Ring of Punishment and lie in wait outside. The
reason for her ambush eluded her until she laid eyes on you. With her
combat prowess and intelligence, she instinctively knew what steps to
take. No need for me to give detailed instructions.

"The Hypnotist's mission involved using Psychological Invisibility to
wander the vicinity, just aimlessly wandering.

"As for the other Demoness, her duty was to monitor the patrol team and
promptly report any issues to the authorities. Before your arrival, she
too was unaware of the real reason behind her actions. She simply
thought we had plans involving the patrol team.

"Before the Hypnotism wore off, none of us had intentions of confronting
you. Our individual actions couldn't pose lethal harm to you, ensuring
you couldn't foresee it.

"This was a premeditated encounter, a clash pitting you against multiple
adversaries."

With that final sentence, Lumian suddenly heard an illusory shattering
sound.

He sensed that his Conspirer potion had been fully digested.

He also felt Hisoka's seemingly cold expression, vexation, and regret
growing, gnawing at his heart.

Lumian's smile widened. He stood up, leaned forward, and inched his head
in front of Hisoka. He looked into Hisoka's bloodshot flaxen-colored
eyes and said, "Your biggest mistake was not leaving Port Pylos ahead of
time and sticking with the patrol team.

"Why are you so certain I won't track you down?"

"How do you know I enjoy Fermo coffee without sugar?" Hisoka inquired
instead of answering.

Sensing his intense anger and killing intent, Lumian straightened up and
replied with a smile, "My sister always says that wherever you go, you
leave a trace, and I have an expert at finding traces with me.

"Heh heh, Emperor Roselle must have said something similar. You must
know what it means."

Hisoka's hands tightened on the chair's armrests as he asked again, "Why
were you so sure I'll kill Kolobo?"

Lumian replied with a sense of satisfaction, "I wasn't certain.

"Didn't I mention I had a Demoness companion monitoring the patrol team?

"Hidden Blade and I believed that if you ultimately choose to escape,
you will definitely do something to vent your murderous desires.
Otherwise, something might happen to you, considering your Devil and
Prisoner pathways. And since you want to kill someone, it's either the
patrol team member who traded with me or Camus who gave me the
information. It's either at the Matani Shop or in the patrol team."

At this juncture, Lumian guessed with a smile, "You took the gamble of
staying in Port Pylos and the patrol team because you wanted to seize an
opportunity to kill me? Under the watchful eyes of the Tarot Club and
Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society, finding a chance to eliminate a
promising young man like me and escape unscathed can satisfy your
twisted mind to the fullest extent?"

Hisoka subconsciously licked his lips.

"I initially planned to bide my time, waiting for your patience to wear
thin and an opportune moment to present itself. But it seems you didn't
seek the assistance of the demigods; you only reached out to Hela.

"I should have struck last night."

Hisoka didn't conceal his frustration.

Lumian didn't immediately address the topic. After a few moments of
contemplation, he said,

"Waiting for an opportunity... You're quite confident in concealing your
identity. Unafraid of normal investigations,

"Is it because the higher-ups of the patrol team allowed a Sequence 6 of
the Prisoner pathway to join?"

Hisoka sealed his lips, responding with silence.

"Seems there's a significant secret lurking here." Lumian suddenly
sensed a conspiracy. "Is the opportunity you're waiting for connected to
this secret?"

Hisoka maintained silence, his eyes transformed, now bloodthirsty and
filled with a desire to kill.

"Not willing to share?" Lumian chuckled. "No problem. Let's discuss
something else first."

He bent down again, looking at Hisoka.

"In this operation, I sought only Hela. Firstly, to guard against the
Nois family Demons who had made contact with you. Secondly, to create an
environment for a quiet conversation with you."

At the mention of the Nois family's Demons, Hisoka's gaze subtly
shifted.

"How do you know?"

Lumian didn't reply. The corners of his mouth curled up even more.

"I chose Hela because I wanted to capture you alive, relying on my own
strength and that of my companions.

"Each of us is weaker than you, and each of us is someone you think you
can easily kill. However, as a team, through teamwork, we've put you in
a tight spot. You'll descend into hell."

Hisoka shattered the chair's armrest, but he couldn't attack Lumian.

Observing his bloodshot eyes, Lumian retrieved a golden straw hat from
his Traveler's Bag, pressed it to his chest, and bowed.

"I'll excuse myself for a moment," he said with a smile.

In the next moment, Lumian left the dream.

Swiftly shifting his sitting position, he leaned against a broken stone
pillar. From his Traveler's Bag, he retrieved Gardner Martin's Beyonder
characteristic, teeth, blood, Colorful Bearded Horned Lizard's venom,
hornbeam essential oil, and other items.

He had genuinely sensed Hisoka's fear, anger, and frustration. Although
it occurred in a dream, it was reflected in Hisoka's brain and body,
real and intense.

He was about to concoct the Reaper potion.
