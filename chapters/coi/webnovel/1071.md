## Chapter 1071: Fooling

The figure of The Fool, inundated with countless pieces of knowledge,
suddenly froze, his head exploding into a mass of warped maggots.

These maggots rapidly disappeared, leaving behind only a pair of black
gloves and a cane inlaid with many star fragments.

Amidst the thin mist that permeated the mountain peaks, another figure
descended---once again, The Fool, dressed in a black coat and wearing a
half top hat.

The black gloves and star-studded cane immediately returned to his
control.

Just now?

That was just a historical projection!

On the black shadow that the Hidden Sage had transformed into, the
protruding black and white distinct eyes each rotated, reflecting the
figure of The Fool once more.

At this moment, He wanted to escape.

This is not to say that He lacked the courage to destroy His current
body and revive using the backup, hidden information from other
locations---for a being of such a living Uniqueness, this would not be
too painful.

The reason restraining Him from making this choice was:

for the designated backup information to receive the Uniqueness, the
Hidden Sage had to, before death, actively choose and activate it
Himself, and this activation could potentially be traced and located. As
the embodiment of mysticism knowledge, the Hidden Sage naturally knew
the specialties of His current enemies, and what role the dark barrier
that had sealed off the entire unknown realm and the permeating gray fog
within it could play.

If He did not activate it, the Uniqueness would naturally transfer to
the nearest backup information, following the proximity principle, and
the Hidden Sage had hidden another backup within this unknown realm.

When He had initially made these arrangements, His idea was that if a
powerful enemy arrived, He could try to drive them away or outright kill
them and claim the spoils by reviving twice, and if the two revivals
failed, it would mean He could not win, so He would let Himself be
killed the third time and revive from the backup information hidden
elsewhere, fully escaping the entanglement.

In other words, the Hidden Sage was not panicked now---after dying twice
more, He could truly flee this unknown realm without being tracked, and
return to a state of hiding.

His current plan was to try counterattacking, and if that didn't work,
just wait to be killed, rather than self-destruct.

Information underwent loss, degradation, errors, and chaos in the
process of constant backups---this was a fundamental rule of the entire
world, a manifestation of error, decay, and increasing entropy. The more
times the overall information was backed up, the higher the probability
of problems arising, and the greater the latent chaos. If the Hidden
Sage were to revive using the fourth set of information, some hidden
errors might emerge, and the enemy before Him symbolized Error.

In this matter, self-destruction would lead to more significant
degradation and amplification of chaos in the information, because it
started from an internal, self-conscious negation, rather than being
killed by others.

In the black and white distinct eyes that reflected The Fool's figure,
new ethereal symbols emerged---not complex, just simple numbers.

One was "0", the other "1".

In the cognition of the Moses Ascetic Order, each number had
spirituality and its own symbolic meaning.

Of course, numbers did not directly possess power, but they could bring
corresponding occult implications.

And one of the Hidden Sage's core abilities was to imbue numbers with
power, giving them truly different, somewhat diminished symbolic force
compared to the original!

Among them, "0" represented chaos, the unknown, what existed before
everything, while "1" represented the beginning, the Oldest One, the
Creator who made this world.

The "0" and "1" within those black and white eyes suddenly underwent a
change.

They connected end-to-end, rapidly flowing through the transparent
tunnel formed by the eye orbs, shifting from "0" to "1", then from "1"
back to "0", from non-existence to existence, and then back again.

Accompanying the appearance and flow of these "0" and "1", the unknown
realm rapidly became transparent.

Whether it was the realm itself, the shrouding dark barrier, or the
diffused gray fog, all were now composed of countless "0" and "1".

They were clusters formed by just these two numbers!

The figure of The Fool also underwent similar changes---crawling over
his face, his gloves, were countless small worms, transparent or
brilliant or segmented, all woven from intertwined strings of "0" and
"1".

Under the Hidden Sage's influence, vast numbers of "1" were turning into
"0", and when "0" dominated the majority, this numeric world would
completely collapse and disappear into "nothingness", unable to impede
the Hidden Sage's escape any longer.

Even The Fool himself would be affected, unable to locate and track in
time!

Suddenly, The Fool's figure vanished.

He appeared in the sky filled with digital fog, thrusting the
star-studded cane downward from afar.

Silently, the dark barrier confining the unknown realm imploded inward,
causing the diffuse gray fog and the unknown realm itself to crumble
inch by inch, generating a series of terrifying spatial-temporal storms.

The Fool had proactively plunged this numeric world into destruction.

The raging spatial-temporal storms swept towards the Hidden Sage, the
surrounding disintegration and collapse also spreading to this evil god.

The Hidden Sage was not alarmed, but delighted.

This destruction not only caused the last backup information hidden in
the unknown realm to be destroyed, allowing Him to truly escape The
Fool's pursuit after just one more death, but also lifted the barrier,
throwing the situation into chaos---even if He fled directly or
activated the corresponding backup information in advance, He wouldn't
have to worry about being tracked!

The Hidden Sage, with His countless black and white distinct eyes, let
the world's collapse and the spatial-temporal storms' tearing ravage
fall upon Himself.

He was immediately reduced to stream after stream of transparent,
ethereal information.

This information was tinged with an imperceptible crimson.

Just as the Hidden Sage was about to fade away and revive from the
hidden backup information, the left hand of The Fool in the sky---not
holding the star-studded cane---suddenly reached forward.

*Clang!*

The ancient tolling of a bell echoed through the world on the verge of
total collapse, and the hands of the massive illusory stone clock were
pressed down by the black palm.

The raging dark storms, the collapsing mountains, chasms, and seas---all
were frozen, as if turned into a photograph.

In this scene, the only ones still able to move were The Fool and the
Hidden Sage, which had already collapsed into multiple streams of
information but not yet completely vanished.

Mr. Fool had not included the Hidden Sage within the time-freeze!

The black coat behind him billowed, and the face under the black hat
became dim and obscure.

Fooled!

In the wilderness, Lumian, having received the cue, jumped into the fog
completely filling the sunken pit with the phone in hand.

This secret passage had long been Grafted to the unknown realm where the
Hidden Sage was.

As Lumian's figure appeared within this destruction scene paused in
time, the Hidden Sage, fragmented into multiple streams of information
and instinctively wanting to flee, suddenly sensed something.

He sensed the presence of a Child of God.

*No, that is the aura of the Great Mother!*

*The Great Mother has come to save me!*

The streams of the Hidden Sage's information rushed towards the
uncloaked Lumian, whose radiant countenance was now revealed.

Not only did He feel He had been saved, but He also believed there was a
chance to turn the tide.

If the Great Mother had personally intervened, what else could not
happen?

Lumian raised his right hand, holding the phone displaying a small
program screen towards the front.

At this moment, the "freezing" had reached its limit, and the
destruction resumed its progress.

The Hidden Sage's information surged even more frantically.

Affected by this evil god's aura, personage, and current state, Lumian's
fair, smooth skin began peeling away, with chunks of flesh writhing,
about to sprout distinct black and white eyes.

This was both corruption and impact.

Lumian did not flee or abandon the phone, standing still and savoring
the physical pain and spiritual ecstasy.

The residual aura of the Blood Emperor, the seal of the Underworld
Daoist, and the pitch-black "pinhole" in his palm had all been
activated---his mind was descending into chaos, as if he had gained
knowledge he should not have.

His mouth curled up, with two distinct black and white eyes.

Looking at the frantically surging transparent information of the Hidden
Sage, he smiled brilliantly.

*I've come to find you!*

*I told you, I would come find you!*

Piece by piece, the flesh on Lumian's body began falling off, each
bearing distinct black and white eyes, but he remained motionless, still
firmly gripping the phone made by the God of Steam and Machinery.

Finally, the Hidden Sage's information reached its destination.

Lumian immediately pressed the Information Shredder app's run button.

The phone's surface suddenly turned dark, drawing in the remaining light
and the disembodied information around it.

The Hidden Sage abruptly became lucid, but it was too late---the phone
had transformed into a massive vortex, sweeping in all the transparent,
ethereal information it had fragmented into.

Seeing this, Lumian no longer held back, igniting the corrupted himself
with the Fire of Destruction.

Amid the violent burning of the black flames restraining his frenzy and
repression, he turned to ash with a brilliant yet horrifying smile.

The real him had died.

The corruption spread to the mirror, and the him in the mirror also
died.

Only the dormant mirror, hidden away beforehand by Concealment powers,
remained unaffected.

The phone's barrier lit up again, the portion of ethereal glow composed
of complex information desperately trying to break free, escaping
control.

The Fool, in the black coat and half-high hat, descended in front of the
phone and Lumian's Traveler's Bag, with the collapsing and
disintegrating unknown realm behind him.

The Hidden Sage cried out in despair and fear, "Spare me! I will pledge
loyalty to you!

"Spare me!"

The Fool's voice was coldly incisive yet somewhat gentle.

"You have harmed too many people."

He raised the star-studded cane, pushing the struggling Hidden Sage back
into the phone screen.

From the depths of the phone, a chilling sound, like a monster gnawing
on human bones, echoed out.
