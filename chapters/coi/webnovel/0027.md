## Chapter 27: Five Changes

As Lumian awoke in the gray fog, his first instinct was not to check his
physical condition. Instead, he sat up abruptly and looked at the table
by the window.

There, bathed in the soft light that filtered through the thick fog,
were the three Red Chestnut Flowers and the glass bottle of poplar leaf
powder.

*She really sent the supplementary ingredients in...* Relief
flooded Lumian. He got out of bed and stretched, delighted to discover
that the pain in his neck and back had vanished, along with the general
discomfort he had been feeling.

*Just as I hoped, I'm fine in the dream when I'm better in reality even
though the injuries on both sides aren't equal at all...* He
quickly walked over to the wardrobe with the full-length mirror, took
off his shirt, and examined himself.

The five bloody finger marks, the bruises, and the blood clots were all
gone.

This made Lumian wonder if killing the Beyonder monster had been nothing
more than a dream.

Thankfully, the crimson object in the cloth bag, the slightly larger sum
of money, and the shotgun next to his bed confirmed the reality of his
experience.

Lumian's heart eased. With the cloth bag containing the crimson item and
a large amount of money, he left the bedroom and went straight to the
first floor. Grabbing a bottle of red wine and a beer mug, he headed
back up with some basil.

He made sure to bring along a measuring cylinder and miniature scale
that his sister Aurore had purchased for his studies.

Looking at the desk filled with all the necessary items, Lumian felt
both excited and nervous.

With everything in place, all that remained was to concoct the potion!

Potions were not beverages. They were more dangerous than alcohol,
capable of killing or transforming the drinker into a monster with the
slightest mistake.

Lumian took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, his hands steady as he
used the measuring cylinder to pour 80 milliliters of red wine into the
beer mug.

Next, he added 10 grams of basil, 5 grams of poplar leaf powder, and a
single Red Chestnut Flower.

The process proceeded without incident. The red liquid in the mug had a
few more dregs and a floating flower, but otherwise looked unremarkable.

With the cloth bag of crimson substance at his side, Lumian watched
intently as the object slid into the beer mug.

Without a sound, the dark-red blob seemed to dissolve rapidly, drawing
in the surrounding liquid in the process.

Bubbles erupted, and the entire mug turned a deep shade of red. The Red
Chestnut Flower had dissolved completely.

*This is the Hunter potion?* Lumian gulped and picked up his
beer mug.

The supernatural power he had sought for so long was finally within his
grasp.

Without hesitation, he took a deep breath and steeled himself for what
was to come. Raising the mug to his lips, he drank the potion in one
swift gulp.

The pungent odor of blood filled his nostrils, and he started hearing
things.

As he set the mug down, a searing pain ripped through his body,

so intense that Lumian wondered if he had swallowed a ball of fire. The
flames seemed to burn through his esophagus, stomach, heart, lungs,
intestines, and blood vessels all at once.

At the same time, a strong scent of blood wafted up from his throat.

Lumian fought to remain conscious, remembering the lady's warning that
fainting would mean defeat. He knew the stakes were high, and the
outcome was obvious if he failed.

His head swam as he lowered it, gazing at the bright red veins
protruding from the back of his hand.

The pain and burning came in waves, but they quickly began to recede.
But just as he thought it was over, a mysterious voice echoed in his
mind, as if coming from both infinitely far away and right beside him.

The sound was like steel thorns piercing his brain, stirring it
forcefully.

Suddenly, the near-death experience he had faced before returned, and
the pain and burning flared up once more.

Lumian gritted his teeth and clenched his fists, feeling as though
something was trying to claw its way out of his flesh.

The gray fog around him seemed to thicken.

The terrifying sound that had filled his ears slowly faded away, and the
writhing of his flesh and blood vanished like an illusion.

The excruciating pain, the burning sensation, and the metallic scent of
blood dissipated, leaving Lumian gasping for cold air as he regained
control of his body.

He bent over, hands on his knees, panting heavily as he realized the
true dangers of pursuing superpowers, as his sister had warned him.

A mere Sequence 9 potion had nearly claimed his life!

Of course, it had first seemed manageable---dangerous, but manageable.
But the mysterious voice that had been brought on by the symbol on his
chest had almost caused him to collapse at the critical moment.

Each breath he took seemed to restore some of his strength, and before
long, he felt fully recovered.

*Bang! *Lumian clenched his fist and swung it hard, striking out
at the air with a force that caused a sonic boom.

He had never imagined possessing such power before, and the realization
filled him with excitement. In his small bedroom, he practiced a combat
technique his sister had taught him, each punch producing a crisp sound.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

Despite the commotion, Lumian moved with precision and control, not
touching anything as he completed the set.

To his surprise, he felt neither tired nor fatigued, but rather
energetic and alive.

He assessed his condition:

*On par with Aurore...*

*In terms of strength, speed, reaction, or body control, they've all
been greatly enhanced. It's a little inhuman...*

*I possess the strength of a bear and the agility of a cat. It's
slightly equivalent to the combination of the two...*

*Without the potion, I might never be able to reach this level of power
in my life...*

But before he could finish his inspection, Lumian caught the scent of
blood, his heart tightening with fear. Instinctively, he sniffed the air
and realized that he could determine the source of the blood---it came
from his body!

Lumian looked down and saw that the back of his hand was covered in
blood-red spots.

He came to the full-body mirror again and realized that his face was
similarly stained.

He wiped some of the blood away, but found no sign of any wounds.

After a moment's thought, Lumian came to a realization.

*Did the potion cause the capillaries Aurore talked about to burst? And
then they quickly healed after I absorbed the potion?*

The only explanation for his current condition was supernatural
influence.

Realizing he was not injured, Lumian pushed the matter aside and focused
on his sense of smell, which seemed to have undergone a significant
change.

As he concentrated, the scents around him were "decomposed" and drilled
into his nose in various forms.

*The smell of blood, the residual smell of alcohol, the fragrance of
flowers, the smell of dust...* Lumian began identifying the
scents around him one by one, even the slightest ones not escaping his
heightened senses.

Simultaneously, he "saw" invisible footprints and the distribution of
dust in the bedroom, "heard" the beating of his own heart and the breeze
outside the house...

*The second change is that my sensory abilities have increased
exponentially, surpassing the standards of ordinary humans. No wonder
the monster I had encountered was so skilled at tracking...*
Lumian was delighted.

More importantly, this improvement did not interfere with his daily life
and only appeared when he focused. It only took the form of a weaker
version.

Through experimentation and self-examination, Lumian discovered two
other changes brought on by the Hunter potion.

*The third change allows me to accurately locate certain points in his
environment, such as weak spots in a wall, enabling me to set traps more
efficiently and kill my enemies---be they humans, beasts, or
monsters---more effectively.*

*The fourth change is that I have more knowledge about wild plants and
animal organs, allowing me to survive better in the wilderness and
quickly find hemostatic medicine when injured. I can even make poison to
smear on weapons if needed...*

As he confirmed these newfound abilities, Lumian couldn't help but feel
a sense of absurdity.

*I actually managed to kill that shotgun monster?*

*The current me is much stronger than the previous me, and it was not
much weaker than the current me..*

Lumian contemplated for a while and concluded two crucial points.

*Ability is important, but brains are equally important!*

*Exploiting a good environment can effectively increase my
strength!*

After some thought, Lumian added inwardly, *Also, I can't be careless
and lose my patience at any time...*

He walked to the window and gazed at the dream ruins again.

An indescribable sense of oppression, fear, and danger surged into his
heart. This was something he had never felt before.

*Uh, the fifth change is some kind of intuition
strengthening...* Lumian nodded gently.

He went to the washroom and washed his body with clean water. He changed
into a fresh set of clothes and then lay back on the bed, with the money
close.

He wanted to get back to reality as soon as possible, eager to know if
the Hunter abilities would stay with him or if they would be weakened.

†

In the dead of night, Cordu was eerily silent. The clouds shrouded the
crimson moon and stars, leaving the darkness to reign supreme.

Lumian surveyed the night scenery and felt an overwhelming sense of
happiness.

He was now a Beyonder in the real world, and his powers hadn't weakened
at all compared to the dream realm.

As an intuition struck him, Lumian unbuttoned his shirt and gazed down
at his chest.

The black symbol resembling a thorn chain was slowly fading away.

*It also appears in reality...* Lumian muttered, feeling a
twinge of unease.

He noticed that the bluish-black symbol that had loomed over the thorny
chain existed only in his dreams.

Suddenly, Lumian's heart skipped a beat as he gazed up at the nearby elm
tree. The legendary owl of the Warlock was perched on a branch,
observing him quietly.
