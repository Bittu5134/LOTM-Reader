## Chapter 329: Metallic Creature

Simultaneously with Franca's explanation, inky flames emanated from her
right hand, melding with the mirror that belonged to Lumian's
substitute.

Jenna observed with a mixture of apprehension, her breath held
involuntarily.

†

Within the Bottle of Fiction.

Just as the wall of flames surged forth, kindling the Abyss Demon
Flowers, a pang of agony gnawed at Lumian's heart, birthing a faint
shroud of black flames upon his chest.

In response, his Spirit Body descended gradually, drawn into an abyssal
darkness, a void obliterating light.

*Curse?* Lumian, ensconced within the cradle of crimson flames,
was caught off guard.

The reasons behind this unexpected curse eluded him.

On the one hand, he had preemptively plugged his ears, blunting the
impact of the Soul Assimilation Mystic Spell. On the other, Guillaume
Bénet lay concealed among the dormant Abyss Demon Flowers, offering no
overt indications of invoking contract abilities. Furthermore, he
remained unscathed, leaving behind neither flesh nor blood. Every strand
of his discarded hair had been consumed by the encroaching flames.

As the black flames emerged, the curse lingered at a subdued level,
manifesting as a faint affliction that refrained from impeding his
movements. Instantaneously, Lumian formulated a hypothesis.

This curse came from Franca!

Employing Mirror Substitution, she sought to reach out to him!

With renewed determination, Lumian thrust his hands in the direction of
the padre's covert location.

Resounding with crackling, another barrier of crimson flames
materialized, fire enveloping the descending Abyss Demon Flowers.

Leveraging this veil to obscure Guillaume Bénet's line of sight, Lumian
pivoted and sprinted toward the entryway of the Bottle of Fiction.

His actions and his overt choice resonated with unmistakable clarity,
conveying to Guillaume Bénet: *Why should I fight you within your chosen
battleground? If my comrades are barred from entry, I'll venture outside
and unite with them!*

Emerging from his concealment behind a cluster of Abyss Demon Flowers,
Guillaume Bénet radiated a metallic gleam across his exposed skin.

Blazing tongues of fire surged toward him, yet they could only "strip
away" a fraction of fabric, unable to sear his flesh.

Through the fiery veil, the Cordu padre bestowed a smile upon Lumian's
indistinct figure.

Given the capability to freely traverse the Bottle of Fiction with
requisite conditions fulfilled, he had ingeniously laid a trap at the
entryway, awaiting Lumian's unwitting ensnarement!

Having assumed a metallic form, his utility was confined to boons
involving his body, fate, and three distinct contract abilities
untouched by his transformation. Among the latter was:

Shadow Burial!

A black mark on Guillaume Bénet's torso wavered, summoning pallid-white
and abyssal-black arms that extended from the encroaching shadows,
ensnaring Lumian, mid-sprint toward the entryway.

Lumian, with a forceful stomp, catapulted into the air, seemingly aiming
to vault over the eerie appendages emerging from the shadows, seeking
sanctuary at the hushed, inky exit.

Behind him, a crimson fireball materialized, poised to detonate at a
moment's notice, transmuting into a vessel of obliteration.

Simultaneously, fierce fireballs ignited to his left and right, as if
poised to counteract the grasp of the arms.

Guillaume Bénet's metallic visage bore a smile more discernible than
before, though it remained deprived of vitality---stern and emotionless.

He anticipated Lumian's imminent leap into the Bottle of Fiction's exit.

The strange arms accompanying the Shadow Burial served as a diversionary
tactic, forestalling any suspicions from arising!

*It's a pity that I can't use Bone Curse in my metallic state.
Otherwise, this would be a good opportunity...* Guillaume Bénet
hesitated to dispel his Steel Body and deal Lumian another blow.

That way, he wouldn't be able to transform into a metallic creature
again anytime soon. The abandoned mine now permeated with anesthetic gas
would shortly transform into an inferno. For weak humans lacking
godhood, this hostile terrain was untenable. Even Alms Monks could
sustain themselves only a brief interval longer.

In the throes of hesitation, Guillaume Bénet ultimately opted to persist
with Shadow Burial, permitting the nightmarish arms to continue their
relentless encroachment upon Lumian.

With a vigorous leap, Lumian neared the exit of the Bottle of Fiction,
almost within grasp.

At that moment, the pitch-black exit---a shadowed orifice devoid of
flame---suddenly writhed faintly, akin to a shadowy maw yearning for
sustenance.

Undetected, a suffused aura of "shadow" had enshrouded the secret door's
surface, a profundity seemingly imbued with life!

This was a trap Guillaume Bénet had meticulously laid. The mechanism lay
dormant during Lumian's initial entrance, solely activating when Lumian
attempted exit. This safeguard was devised to preempt Lumian from having
any danger premonitions when initially entering the Bottle of Fiction,
deterring him from braving its confines.

Lumian perceived the sensation of plummeting into an abyss, the final
lifeline eluding his grip.

The deceptively thin veil of darkness coiled, an amalgam of endless
shadows that converged into an abyssal maw, an aperture on the verge of
engulfing him.

Mid-flight, Lumian extended his right palm, yet just before it made
contact with the shadowy maw shrouding the hidden door, he abruptly
withdrew it, mimicking a gesture of prying open a door.

In tandem, the Decency brooch nestled upon his right chest emitted a
subdued golden glow.

Distortion!

Lumian distorted the action of opening the door with the concept of
"unsealing this confined space!"

From the outset, his intent to depart the Bottle of Fiction was absent.
Instead, he sought to find a way for his companions to infiltrate, thus
furnishing reinforcement.

This enclave laden with combustible resources stood as a haven for a
Pyromaniac!

*Boom!*

With a resounding detonation, the crimson fireball positioned to
Lumian's left erupted, issuing a horizontal thrust that exacted a
substantial toll. His attire lay rent, and his flesh bore charred
imprints, inflicted by the fiery onslaught. Gradually nearing the
shadowy vortex, the forceful explosion propelled him away from the exit
of the Bottle of Fiction and beyond the enshrouded region brimming with
appendages swathed in pallid-white and abyssal-black.

Resounding with a thud, Lumian tumbled, ensconcing himself behind a
rampart of surging flames. This maneuver forestalled the further
encroachment of the shadowy expanse, obliging the strange arms to
contend with the blistering blaze.

Outside the Bottle of Fiction.

A frigid zephyr brushed against Franca and Jenna, wafting from the
hidden door's interior.

Swiftly, the chill metamorphosed into a searing fervor. Behind the
hidden door lay a derelict mine engulfed in a sea of crimson flames, the
blazing inferno punctuated by the descent of undistorted fire dragons,
their incandescence unbridled.

The remaining black vines, the crimson flowers, and the strange arms all
succumbed to the fiery onslaught, pursued relentlessly by the raging
conflagration.

Signaling to Jenna, Franca receded into the shadows as she drew closer
to the hidden door.

Jenna understood Franca's intentions and rationally retreated into the
shadows outside the hidden door, concealing herself.

She knew that it would be difficult for her to participate in the battle
with her strength. Thus, she chose to bide her time, awaiting the
enemy's emergence through the threshold, poised to exploit a fleeting
opportunity to deliver a decisive, lethal strike.

Within the ajar Bottle of Fiction, Lumian, having concluded his
somersault, propped himself up with a single hand.

Locking his gaze onto the distant Guillaume Bénet---his form akin to
that of a metallic marionette---Lumian's lips curled wordlessly,
yielding an eruption of crimson flames that engulfed his flesh and
attire.

A familiar pang of torment reverberated across Lumian's psyche, jolting
him awake from the lethargic stupor.

*It's been some time! *Lumian's grin was tinged with distortion
as he hurtled toward the metal-encased Guillaume Bénet. His forward
momentum stirred the encompassing crimson flames, elongating behind him
like a shimmering, unfurled cape.

Wary of Lumian's earlier utilization of the harrumph spell, Guillaume
Bénet, resembling a puppet forged from steel, evaded direct
confrontation, executing artful shifts in position.

Discerning Lumian's strategy of harnessing the flames to stave off the
Abyss Demon Flowers-induced anesthetic gas, Guillaume Bénet discerned
this endeavor to be fleeting. At best, Lumian's fiery gambit would delay
his descent into unconsciousness. Certain matters couldn't be resolved
by self-harm!

Having adopted the form of a metallic entity via Steel Body, Guillaume
Bénet remained impervious to the anesthetic gas's effects, even forgoing
the need to draw breath. This form also minimized the conflagration's
impact on him. Guillaume Bénet was convinced that Steel Body's efficacy
would persist until Lumian Lee succumbed to unconsciousness.

Furthermore, his assessment revealed Lumian's substantial spirituality
expenditure, coupled with Lumian's evident abstention from Spirit World
Traversal.

This deduction led Guillaume Bénet to surmise that the harrumph spell
likely bore limitations on its frequency of use.

Of course, sustained evasion was untenable. Lumian Lee's actions hinted
at him using some unconventional means to open the Bottle of Fiction,
suggesting his companions had likely infiltrated covertly through
invisibility. Guillaume Bénet couldn't allow this duo to demonstrate the
potency of their teamwork.

Nimbly maneuvering around the plummeting tendrils of flaming vines,
Guillaume Bénet executed a sudden pivot, facing Lumian with unwavering
intent.

His metallic countenance mirrored the flaming luminance, refracting a
kaleidoscopic iridescence.

Myriads of diminutive "rainbows" coalesced, cleaving Guillaume Bénet as
though he gazed upon his mirror image.

Light Incarnation!

One of the three contractual abilities accessible in his Steel Body
state.

Its premise lay in leveraging light to forge a fleeting incarnation,
capable of channeling an individual's capabilities.

Two metallic Guillaume Bénets surged toward Lumian simultaneously.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Each stride they undertook fostered corporeal
expansion, culminating in the metamorphosis into metallic titans, which
tore asunder their white robes adorned with silver-black threads.

Elevating his right hand, Lumian summoned into being a host of crimson
Fire Ravens that swirled about him.

The Fire Ravens promptly surged toward the two Guillaume Bénets,
demonstrating no clemency.

Given the inherent challenge of distinguishing authenticity from
imitation within a short span of time, Lumian adopted a stratagem of
unleashing an onslaught indiscriminately---comprising both genuine and
illusory manifestations!

For truth could not be falsified, nor could falsity be genuine!

In an abrupt detonation, the Guillaume Bénet before him disintegrated.

*Rumble!*

Accompanied by the explosion, amid which a multitude of Fire Ravens were
prematurely engulfed in combustion, a Water Cannon sculpted from
dark-green liquid surged forth from the fake Guillaume Bénet's
fragmented remnants.

The Water Cannon, of astonishing alacrity and proximity, penetrated
Lumian's fiery shroud, impinging upon his form. As a consequence,
Lumian's physique began exhibiting telltale signs of liquefaction.

Draynere Gland Poison!

One of three contractual abilities he could use as a metallic entity!

With a brittle crack, Lumian's corporeal structure fractured,
metamorphosing into mirrors.

A mere ten meters from Guillaume Bénet, Franca, owing to the activation
of Mirror Substitution, involuntarily escaped her state of Invisibility.

Observing her emergence, Guillaume Bénet's blue irises assumed a pallor
bordering on translucence. A deft push of his right palm propagated the
emergence of an expansive river of mercurial sigils encircling Franca.

Pitting himself directly against Lumian Lee proved to be a disconcerting
engagement for Guillaume Bénet. His paramount and most formidable Fate
Appropriator ability remained inaccessible, for its utilization would
catalyze a consequential backlash from Inevitability.

Since it couldn't be used on Lumian Lee, it could be used on his
companion!
