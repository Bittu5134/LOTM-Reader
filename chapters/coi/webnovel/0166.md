## Chapter 166: In Return

Lumian had always believed that the tenant, like Charlie, had been
enchanted by Susanna Mattise in his dreams. His vitality had been
gradually drained, until he met a sudden demise in the room. Monsieur
Ive, the hotel owner, had secretly transported the lifeless body to a
secluded spot in Underground Trier. Little did he expect that the tenant
would transform into a pervert with Beyonder powers. He now roamed Le
Marché du Quartier du Gentleman, preying on attractive women.

Lumian was convinced that Hedsey's newfound abilities stemmed from a
boon granted due to the absence of Beyonder characteristics after death.
It was clear that these powers originated from the same source as
Susanna Mattise and Monsieur Ive.

In essence, not long after Susanna Mattise's portrait was plastered,
something extraordinary had occurred to Hedsey. He had become a devout
follower of the Mother Tree of Desire and received two to three boons
within a few short months. As a result, he had gained significant
strength and mastery over various mystical techniques.

For Beyonders who progressed by consuming potions, such speed was
unimaginable, unless they possessed profound understanding and were at a
remarkably low level.

However, Hedsey's boons also came with a downside. The recipient would
be influenced by the power and gradually deviate from their true self.
In certain aspects, they would become increasingly extreme, often
engaging in actions that seemed irrational to ordinary individuals and
inviting disaster upon themselves.

Both Monsieur Ive's miserliness and Hedsey's insatiable lust for women
fell into this category.

Lumian suspected that nearly all boons had similar repercussions to some
extent. Over time, they would inexorably draw the bestowed closer to the
bestower and induce corresponding mutations.

The reason Lumian remained unaffected by the powers of the Dancer and
Alms Monk was that they didn't directly come from the hidden entity
known as Inevitability, but rather the corruption within his body that
had been filtered through the seal. Additionally, Lumian had always
maintained a vigilant stance in such matters. He not only refrained from
altering his style and way of life to exploit the traits of the Dancer
and Alms Monk for greater control over his strength but at times even
went against their influence.

Furthermore, Lumian would advance in Sequence and have a preliminarily
digestion before obtaining the corresponding boon. He sought to preserve
the balance of power within his body.

Lowering his head, Lumian whispered to Jenna in a hushed voice, "How did
you discover this?"

As Jenna swayed to the rhythm, she pursed her lips and replied, "It's
quite evident that the pervert cannot exist without women. Kidnapping a
woman every day and dragging her underground simply isn't feasible, or
else he would have been apprehended long ago. Damn it, there must have
been several victims. Do those incompetent black-skinned dogs even
notice?

"Then how does he usually solve his problem? Clearly, relying on himself
isn't sufficient to satiate his desires. So, I enlisted Franca's help
and inquired with the dancers and street girls from the Savoie Mob. I
swiftly obtained an answer."

"How can that pervert, who deserves to be fucked by a donkey, possess
such virility? He can perform multiple times a day!"

"Why doesn't he pursue those wealthy old ladies? Both parties would be
satisfied!"

Jenna recounted her investigation with a sense of pride, showcasing her
intellect.

Throughout the afternoon, she had been brooding over Lumian's earlier
prank, which had made her appear foolish.

*Before embracing the beliefs of the Mother Tree of Desire and receiving
the boon, Hedsey was a regular visitor to Rue de la Muraille, Rue de
Breda, and Rue du Rossignol. However, after obtaining the boon, his mind
became consumed with thoughts of women...* Lumian couldn't help
but acknowledge that Jenna occasionally demonstrated some intelligence.

With that in mind, Lumian decided to share some information.

"That abnormal desire must be a result of his Beyonder powers'
influence."

"Beyonder powers..." Jenna glanced up at Lumian.

She had expected him to feign ignorance, just as they did in Underground
Trier, where neither side openly acknowledged Hedsey's displayed
Beyonder powers. To her surprise, he spoke candidly.

After a brief pause, Jenna, who was dancing closely with Lumian,
whispered in confusion, "Why do Beyonder powers make him so perverse?"

This was unlike the Beyonder powers she was familiar with, which at most
had a slight effect before losing control.

Lumian smirked once again. "It's an abnormal Beyonder power."

"Do you think I can't tell that it's abnormal?" Jenna grew infuriated
once more.

Lumian chuckled.

"As for why it's abnormal, go back and ask Franca. If Franca doesn't
know either, have her inquire with the Boss."

He shared this information with Jenna because he was concerned that
there might be more to the issues surrounding Monsieur Ive, Susanna
Mattise, Hedsey, and the others.

If the official Beyonders failed to uncover the truth, his only hope lay
with Mr. K's finger and the Beyonders associated with the Savoie Mob.

Jenna snorted and dropped the matter. She refocused on dancing with
Lumian.

As the music neared its end, she suddenly reached out and touched
Lumian's chest.

"Haha, nice bod!" Jenna grinned, then retreated, heading towards the
half-height wooden platform in front of the dance floor.

It seemed as though she had finally exacted her revenge for what had
transpired underground. She was filled with elation.

Lumian scoffed and left the dance floor, once again picking up his glass
of rye beer.

As he listened to the music, he swayed his body gently, all the while
observing the situation within Salle de Gristmill.

As Lumian surveyed the area, his attention was drawn to a group of
mobsters congregating near the stage. They wore a mishmash of outfits,
surrounding a towering man who stood at a staggering height of nearly
1.9 meters.

The burly man bore a striking resemblance to "Giant" Simon. His black
shirt and formal attire emphasized his bulging muscles, but the
dark-blue canvas pants and strapless black leather boots seemed out of
place, creating a peculiar ensemble.

With his tousled brown hair and slightly set-apart brown eyes, his
ordinary facial features were complemented by a chiseled jawline. His
hands and legs were longer than those of an average person.

*"Hammer" Ait...* Lumian averted his gaze, suspecting that this
man was one of his targets.

In Trier, there weren't many individuals towering at nearly 1.9 meters.

Lumian wasn't concerned about "Hammer" Ait and his subordinates
recognizing him from this distance. The ballroom was dimly lit, with
only the soft glow of gas wall lamps and a chandelier above, providing
enough illumination for dancing and discreet conversations. Unless
someone was intimately familiar with Lumian or had just seen him, they
wouldn't be able to identify him.

Furthermore, Lumian had taken precautions to disguise himself. He hadn't
anticipated Jenna recognizing him at first glance either.

After Jenna finished singing another song, "Hammer" Ait led his
subordinates off the dance floor and ascended to the second floor.

Lumian continued his observations when he suddenly spotted a familiar
figure entering the room.

It was Monsieur Ive, the proprietor of Auberge du Coq Doré, his attire
slightly faded from washing.

His anxious and worried expression was evident as his blue eyes scanned
the surroundings.

*Is he searching for Hedsey? The pervert didn't return after leaving in
the afternoon. They suspect something happened to him, so they're
scouring the dance halls, seeking clues with the street girls?*
Lumian withdrew his gaze thoughtfully and shifted his attention back to
the dancers on the floor.

Based on the characteristics exhibited by Hedsey's Spirit Body, Lumian
sensed that Monsieur Ive was much weaker in comparison. He likely
possessed the power of a Sequence 9 boon, focused on greed, possibly
with elements of appetite.

As for Hedsey, he was likely on the level of Sequence 8, with a slim
chance of being a Sequence 7. Lumian leaned more towards the former, as
the few Sequence 7 individuals he had encountered before were formidable
adversaries, difficult to overcome even with preparations and traps.

Of course, had Lumian not carefully observed and realized that Hedsey
had the ability to trigger others' desires, he might have been swiftly
dealt with.

In that environment, without Jenna's presence, Lumian would have relied
on his own strength to resist the influence and not completely forget
the existence of the enemy. With Showy Diva, it was challenging for him
to restrain himself. He had to rely on pain to awaken his senses.

From the corner of his eye, Lumian observed Monsieur Ive engaging in
conversation with the part-time street girl dancers. The way they
scolded him, wearing expressions of disdain, struck Lumian as amusing.

*Is he pretending to negotiate a price in order to gather information
about Hedsey's whereabouts?*

*In the end, he's just too stingy, always bargaining down the other
party's offer by half or more, resulting in their scolding?*

*Heh heh, Charlie was worried that Monsieur Ive, an old widower,
wouldn't be willing to spend money on a licensed prostitute and risk
contracting a disease. It seems he's overthinking it. Monsieur Ive can't
even bring himself to spend money on an unlicensed street girl!*

*The negative effects of a boon are truly potent...*

*Hmm, if there are women in that group who possess the same boons as
Hedsey and are on the same level, they should be in a constant state of
hunger and thirst. Monsieur Ive wouldn't need to seek out another street
girl. Heh heh, he would only end up despising himself for being a man.
He would be on the verge of being drained dry, with his desires forcibly
aroused.*

*The best disguises for those women would be dancers and street
girls?*

*Something doesn't add up. If there really were such women, Hedsey
wouldn't need to come out and harm others... Could it be that everyone
at this level has advanced or died, with no replacements? Or is there an
imbalance in the number of men and women? Is Hedsey the one being
ostracized?*

As Lumian contemplated these thoughts, the band struck up another lively
dance tune.

After finishing her song, Jenna leaped off the half-height wooden stage
once again and approached Lumian, inviting him to dance.

This elicited boos from the surrounding crowd.

Knowing that Jenna had something else to say, Lumian deliberately
maneuvered to provoke those who were jeering.

He stepped onto the dance floor, drew closer to Jenna, and began swaying
his hips.

Jenna looked up at him, smiling, and asked, "What brings a Savoie
mobster like you to the Salle de Gristmill?"

Lumian clicked his tongue and chuckled.

"Don't you think I'm fond of you? Of course, I'm here to listen to your
singing."

Jenna scoffed.

"Your target is 'Hammer' Ait, isn't it? You want to repeat what happened
with Margot?"

"You're quite clever," Lumian praised in a taunting tone.

Jenna smirked confidently. "I can assist you and provide important
information."

Lumian suppressed his nonchalance and asked thoughtfully, "What do you
desire in return?"

Jenna snorted and cursed, "Are you fucking underestimating me?

"Although I didn't thank you this afternoon, I won't forget that you
saved me. Coincidentally, I'm familiar with all the dance halls in the
market district. Moreover, I just had a chat with Ait about some matters
after the performance. I should be able to help you."

Without waiting for Lumian's response, she gritted her teeth and
continued, "'Hammer' resides in the innermost room on the second floor,
towards Auberge du Coq Doré. He has ten thugs by his side. Four
stationed at the door---two inside and two outside. Two by the window,
two near the sofa, and two always behind him. They're all armed.

"The security wasn't this tight before, and there weren't as many
people. It's all because of what you did to Margot.

"That room has an attached washroom. It's currently unoccupied. If the
window is fully opened, it can just about accommodate a person.

"From the ventilation pipe in the ballroom kitchen, you can climb up to
the second floor and bypass the guards stationed at the stairs. Then,
enter the adjacent room and leap from the windowsill onto a narrow ledge
outside the washroom. It requires considerable skill to pull off
successfully."
