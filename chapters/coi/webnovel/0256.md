## Chapter 256: Crack

The searing pain in Lumian's left palm from the explosion nearly caused
him to instinctively draw his pewter-black dirk, which had already been
plunged into the core trunk of the Tree of Shadow.

Drawing upon his resilience and experience with similar injuries, he
fought to control his body's reflexive reactions.

As his mind cleared from the stimulation, he managed to shake off the
two desires imposed by Susanna Mattise.

Pain and rationality entwined, engulfing his mind, followed by a
terrifying torrent of scenes.

These were the accumulated experiences of the Tree of Shadow over the
past millennium, countless fragments of desire that had nourished and
formed its trunk. They represented the potential futures of this
malevolent tree.

They converged in a mercury-colored illusory river, flooding Lumian's
thoughts like a deluge.

Not only were there an overwhelming number of scenes that could
overpower any Low-Sequence Beyonder, but some scenes compelled Lumian to
instinctively ignore or overlook them, unable to muster the courage to
look or discern.

Just when he thought his intellect would be crushed by the immense
torrent and reduced to a blank canvas, he realized that he had endured
it. It was as if there existed an additional space capable of
accommodating countless scenes beyond the limit.

Lumian wasted no time in choosing the fate he wished to exchange. Guided
by his intuition for danger and spiritual instincts, he selected a
scene:

A brownish-green root extended towards the depths of an ancient
structure, devoured by an unseen flame that silently burned in the
darkness, casting an eerie glow over the area.

With a crack, the tree root snapped and descended into the shadows.
Purple flames surfaced, swiftly transforming into a color
indistinguishable to the naked eye. In an instant, it dissipated,
leaving no trace behind.

Lumian withdrew Fallen Mercury and exerted all his strength to pry open
this fate, but it remained unresponsive.

*Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!*

Brownish-green tree trunks, not excessively thick, hurtled towards
Lumian like javelins precisely thrown by a platoon of soldiers.

Each one possessed the potential to impale and skewer a target upon the
gnarled tree roots.

In the ethereal canopy of the tree, Susanna Mattise's emerald eyes
widened as she attempted to employ various abilities related to
desires---be it for sex, food, greed, or acting---but all in vain.
Opting for the tree spirit's powers, she aimed to deliver a physical
blow.

Bound to the Tree of Shadow, the methods available to her were far more
potent than those of her counterparts who relied on ordinary trees as
companions.

Though she still doubted that the so-called Cursed Blade could harm the
Tree of Shadow, Lumian's confidence and performance left her somewhat
uneasy. Subconsciously, she believed it wiser to disrupt whatever he was
doing.

She would rather err on the side of believing it to be seriously harmful
and take excessive precautions in advance than be careless and witness
unforeseen changes and the possibility of failure.

The former would at most waste a certain amount of strength and energy,
delaying the completion of the ritual a little. The latter might bring
about changes she didn't want to see and an outcome of failure.

Even if the probability was low, she had to take preventative measures.
She couldn't wait until it happened before attempting to rectify it.

The flesh robe enveloping Lumian's body abruptly contracted, diminishing
his size and evading the majority of the javelin-like tree trunks.

Two of them landed on Lumian's left and right shoulders, leaving him
unable to dodge or evade.

The flesh and blood constituting the robe acted as disciplined soldiers
receiving an order. They surged towards the impending strike,
constructing layers of blood-colored cushions.

With a resounding impact, the layers of flesh were pierced by the two
brownish-green tree spears. More flesh surged forth, hurriedly filling
the void.

Although Mr. K's finger had transformed into a robe of flesh and blood
to mitigate the damage, Lumian's legs buckled under the force akin to
that of a sledgehammer, causing him to tumble backward.

In that moment, he felt the fate of the brownish-green tree root, which
had been burned by the invisible flames, loosen its grip.

The illusory power prying it loose didn't solely belong to Lumian, but
also to his left chest, emanating from an unknown source.

Gritting his teeth, Lumian utilized the momentum of his fall to
laboriously stir up that fate. With great difficulty, he transformed it
into a droplet of mercury and exchanged it with the fate of encountering
the Montsouris ghost, stored within the pewter-black dirk.

With a crisp crack, fractures spread across Fallen Mercury, as if it
struggled to bear the burden of fate. Some fractures were unnaturally
long, others were delicate, and some ran straight through the blade.

With a thud, Lumian collapsed onto the coiled tree roots entrenched in
the ground, freeing himself from the lingering forces of the
brownish-green tree javelins.

His shoulder throbbed with pain, but he remained physically unharmed.
The robe woven of flesh and blood began to disintegrate, trickling down,
obstructing the pale-colored flower and the brownish-green crack as they
unfurled their "mouths" in an attempt to devour Lumian. When he
collapsed, he crushed them.

With a resounding boom, crimson flames erupted, consuming the malevolent
entities. Seizing the opportunity, Lumian swiftly rolled over and
maneuvered to a relatively safe position.

Only then did Lumian recall a crucial issue. Amidst dodging attacks from
trees, branches, leaves, vines, roots, and flowers, and taking whiffs of
the Mysticism Smelling Salts, he whispered amidst sneezes,

"Encountering the Montsouris ghost... Achoo! ...doesn't necessarily mean
that the Montsouris ghost will attack immediately!"

If it took a while, what was the point of his previous efforts?

Disregarding the fact that the Montsouris ghost would assault the Tree
of Shadow every month or two, even if it attacked every four to five
minutes, Lumian found it despairing. When the time came, the
preparations for the ritual would surely be complete. The sacrificial
ceremony would have already commenced. Under the watchful eyes of the
evil god, the Mother Tree of Desire, there was a high likelihood that
the Montsouris ghost would choose to wait a while before returning,
based on its previous patterns.

Termiboros's majestic voice resonated within Lumian's body and ears once
again.

*"It approaches. It is a destined fate."*

In the ethereal canopy of the tree, Susanna ceased her attacks on
Lumian. Utilizing the Tree of Shadow, she remotely guided Charlotte in
controlling the sacrifice while delving her consciousness into the
brownish-green tree, searching for any potential issues resulting from
the pewter-black dirk's assault.

The sooner she discovered it, the sooner she could resolve it and propel
the sacrificial ritual forward!

Upon hearing Termiboros's words, Lumian couldn't help but inquire, "Can
the Montsouris ghost truly destroy the Tree of Shadow?"

Although both entities were malevolent, the giant tree that had been
rooted in Trier's soil for over a thousand years, nourished by countless
desires, and linked to a hidden evil god, appeared loftier, more
menacing, and more wicked.

Termiboros's deep voice resounded, *"No. However, it possesses the
ability to influence the Tree of Shadow to some extent, creating an
opportunity for you to escape."*

Just as Termiboros finished speaking, Lumian caught sight of a sudden
black shadow beside him.

The figure stood slightly hunched, resembling an elderly man burdened by
the weight of life.

The Montsouris ghost!

It had bypassed numerous restrictions and obstacles to arrive in the
alternate space occupied by the Tree of Shadow.

With a single stride, the stooped figure reached the edge of the
brownish-green trunk. Susanna and Charlotte noticed its presence.

They instinctively sensed a threat, yet they didn't connect the black
shadow to Trier's legend of the Montsouris ghost.

Frantically, they stirred up the various desires of the Montsouris
ghost, but their efforts were like stones cast into an unfathomable
abyss. There was no response whatsoever.

For the first time, Lumian beheld the true appearance of the Montsouris
ghost.

It was neither an elderly man nor even human. It more closely resembled
a viscous black shadow taking on a human form, hunching its back.

The Montsouris ghost fixed its gaze upon the Tree of Shadow for two
seconds before pressing itself against the brownish-green trunk.

In an instant, it transformed into a malevolent, pitch-black liquid that
corroded the layers of tree bark.

A sizable pool of moist darkness spread across the surface of the
massive tree trunk, steadily contaminating its surroundings and
expanding its reach.

Within moments, the entire lower portion of the Tree of Shadow was
overtaken by the black shadow, rendering Susanna Mattise and Charlotte
Calvino's attacks futile.

The next second, the oil-painting-like blue sky and white clouds, along
with the ground intertwined with tree roots, trembled visibly as if
experiencing a violent earthquake.

Faint illusory cracks appeared on the surface of the tree trunk, the
ground, and even in the sky. Some of them slowly widened, revealing
glimpses of the street beyond---a distorted microcosm of chaos
influenced by branches, vines, and desire.

*"Be prepared,"* Termiboros's grand voice echoed in Lumian's
ears.

Realizing that she couldn't halt the Montsouris ghost and that the
situation was rapidly deteriorating, Susanna Mattise wore a resentful
expression and recited an incantation in ancient Hermes, "Son of the God
who should never have been born, you are a cage for the imprisoning
curse, an evil that erodes history. I implore your assistance."

The instant Susanna Mattise finished speaking, the branches beneath the
ethereal tree crown began to "secrete" a viscous, pitch-black liquid.

It bore a striking resemblance to the black liquid assumed by the
Montsouris ghost, but there was a significant distinction. It possessed
a greater degree of chaos, frenzy, and wickedness.

Almost simultaneously, pale-white, malformed skulls, yellowish eyeballs
entwined with thick veins, scarlet tongues dripping with repulsive pus,
and indescribably grotesque objects that induced madness by mere sight
sprouted from the liquid secreted by the tree trunk.

In the untamed wilderness, where Madam Judgment and Lady Moon engaged in
their fierce battle, Rue Anarchie and other locations lay scattered. The
brownish-green tree swayed ominously, while tiny cracks that appeared to
pierce the very fabric of reality spread across its surface and
surroundings.

Suddenly, an illusory door materialized in the sky, layer upon layer.

From the midst of these doors emerged a lady clad in an orange dress,
her appearance exuding a languid aura. Worms emitting resplendent
starlight wriggled in and out of her visage, obscuring her true features
from discernment.

With purposeful strides, the woman approached the brownish-green tree,
extending her hands to grasp the sides of an invisible crack, as if
intent on tearing it open!
