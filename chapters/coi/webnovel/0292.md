## Chapter 292: Communion

Termiboros fell silent.

Lumian continued to listen intently to the bishop's sermon as he
recounted the general situation of the Church of The Fool. He discovered
that there existed another continent in this world called the Forsaken
Land of the Gods---a place cursed and abandoned by the gods Themselves.

Despite the gods turning their backs on the continent, Mr. Fool refused
to forsake it. He dispatched the Angel of Redemption---Gehrman
Sparrow---to lead the surviving humans from the lost city-states out of
the Forsaken Land of the Gods and guide them in rebuilding their homes
on the maritime islands.

Consequently, the Church of The Fool's headquarters were established in
the New City of Silver in the Sonia Sea.

The other two Holy Lands, New Moon City and Bayam, the capital of the
Rorsted Archipelago, were also located in the same area.

Lumian listened with fascination, gaining a fundamental understanding of
the Church of The Fool.

Following the sermon, the bishop and a few priests distributed
communion.

It consisted of a glass of transparent, colorless liquid and a large
fruit shell with charred marks covering it.

Lumian picked up the glass and took a sip. The liquid had a slight
sweetness, reminiscent of dairy products but with a more fragrant
essence.

Next, he used a wooden spoon to scoop out the food from the huge fruit
shell.

As soon as he tasted the food, Lumian's expression turned surprised.

*It's meat!*

*Isn't this a bit extravagant?*

Even the Eternal Blazing Sun Church's Communion couldn't compare to
this. They only had red wine and unfermented flatbread.

Lumian perked up and chewed the food with interest. It was delicious,
with a meaty texture and a mix of sweetness and slight sourness, like
that of a fruit. Its aroma was entirely different from the usual dishes
found in Trier.

While he ate, he listened to the bishop explain the origins of
Communion.

It turned out that this was Angel of Redemption Gehrman Sparrow's
favorite food during his travels across the land. As the bugle of the
Lord, he preached the revelations of the Lord.

The liquid was called Teana, derived from a giant fruit unique to the
Rorsted Archipelago, and it was extracted from the pulp.

Having lost most of its pulp, the Teana rind was stuffed with mashed
mutton and fish, culminating in the communion, Teativa.

However, transporting such massive fruits from the Rorsted Archipelago
to Trier for Communion was impractical. It required crossing three seas,
and no matter how unripened the fruit was, it would inevitably rot,
wasting valuable resources.

With the help of a particular botanist, the Church of The Fool had
cultivated a modified Teana tree that could grow in southern Intis,
producing a stronger milky scent.

*A delicacy with a maritime charm... If it weren't for the Church of The
Fool's inability to preach and proselytize, who knows how many people
would convert solely due to the Communion... But that could lead to
financial issues as well. Too many believers in The Fool would cause the
expenses of Communion to skyrocket...* After pondering the
Church of The Fool's finances for a moment, Lumian, who hadn't eaten
dinner yet, finished the Teativa clean and gulped down the Teana juice.

"Praise The Fool!" Lumian stood up sincerely and bowed. He slowly left
the candlelit cathedral and stepped into the night.

Under the warm glow of gas street lamps, Lumian strolled along the port
area, dressed in a linen shirt, black vest, and rolled-up sleeves. His
destination was the other side of the docks, where he intended to catch
a public carriage to Avenue du Boulevard.

Lavigny had grown quiet, with only occasional groups of sailors passing
by, singing or shouting.

All of a sudden, a commotion erupted nearby, followed by a piercing
scream.

As the sound echoed through the night, Lumian noticed a figure hurtling
towards him at an incredible speed.

Casually, he sidestepped, acting like an innocent bystander.

Yet, if the approaching person happened to be vile or had indeed
committed some wrongdoing and was now being chased, Lumian wouldn't mind
sticking out his right foot and tripping them, just for the spectacle.

Within seconds, the figure reached the edge of the street lamp's glow,
making Lumian's eyebrows twitch in surprise.

*So fast!*

*Clearly not an ordinary human!*

With the help of the gas lamps, Lumian got a good look at the figure's
appearance.

It wasn't human---it was a monster!

Though its wrinkled head resembled a human's, its dark-green scales
covered its body. Wearing a torn linen shirt and brown pants, its feet
lacked shoes, and thin, tough skin membrane grew between its fingers.
Slippery dark-green mucus oozed over its form, and its palms and mouth
were stained with blood.

Having encountered numerous monsters in Cordu's ruins, Lumian remained
unperturbed. He only frowned slightly.

It reminds me of those murlocs mentioned in mysticism magazines. Those
dark-green scales must provide formidable defense...

As Lumian pondered, the monster noticed him sidestepping and grew more
violent and crazed in its expression.

Without warning, it lunged at Lumian.

Reacting swiftly, Lumian arched his body, not backing away, but stepping
forward to face the suspected murloc.

*Bang!*

His right hand, emitting sparks, struck the creature's abdomen.

Then, he swiftly lowered his body, slipping under the armpit of the
dark-green-scaled monster, avoiding its counterattack and effectively
positioning himself behind the assailant.

Lumian spun around, his arms swinging. His fists, with flickering
flames, delivered powerful blows to the back of the suspected murloc,
knocking it to the ground.

Blows resounded until Lumian withdrew his hands, ceasing his assault. He
observed silently as the struggling body left corrosive marks on the
ground.

With a muffled explosion, crimson sparks erupted from the monster's
eyes, nose, ears, and mouth. Its body swelled before collapsing,
shedding several dark-green scales.

After a few convulsions, it lay still.

Lumian averted his gaze and looked towards the figures chasing after
him. He nonchalantly flicked his hands, alleviating the corrosive pain
caused by the dark-green liquid.

His injuries were minor. After all, he had delivered a barrage of
powerful punches, and his contact with the dark-green scales and viscous
liquid had been brief.

Soon, the figures reached the lamp pole.

They were sailors, led by a mixed-blood man from the Southern Continent,
sporting braided hair and brownish-red skin.

He appeared to be in his thirties, with thick lips. His eyes first
scanned the murloc-like monster lying motionless on the ground, then he
looked at Lumian with surprise, suspicion, and fear.

After a few seconds of silence, the sailor with the braided hair spoke
with a solemn voice, "This is the murloc we captured at sea. It injured
one of our crewmates and managed to escape."

It is indeed a murloc... Did they truly capture it? Why didn't they turn
it into various materials and transport it to Trier? Why risk keeping it
alive? Lumian silently mused as he asked with a smile, "Are you planning
to apologize on its behalf and compensate me for my mental distress to
soothe my terrified mind?"

The sailor and his companions exchanged glances, unable to decipher the
lad's true intentions.

In the distance, the sound of regimental-like running resonated,
accompanied by gunfire.

Patrol soldiers had rushed over upon hearing the scream.

The sailor's heart tightened as he unconsciously grabbed the monster's
corpse, closely observing Lumian's reaction. He intended to stop once
the other party showed any dissatisfaction.

Simultaneously, he continued, "No problem. We have no problem."

What he meant was that they would provide compensation for Lumian's
mental distress.

Lumian sensed that they mainly wanted the Beyonder characteristic
produced by the murloc, but the monster was too weak. He wasn't in the
mood to discuss how the prize would be divided with them.

It was not worthy of the Shadow Branch at all!

If these individuals, who acted recklessly without concern for covering
their tracks, managed to evade pursuit and crossed paths with him again,
he could simply demand compensation from them for his mental distress.

As Lumian watched the sailors carry the murloc away, he continued on his
way as if nothing had happened.

Before long, several patrolling soldiers caught up with him, examining
his condition and inquiring if he had witnessed anything unusual.

Lumian candidly pointed in the direction the sailors had fled.

"I heard a scream and saw a group of people running that way. They were
dressed like sailors."

The officer leading the patrol nodded approvingly.

"Thank you for your cooperation."

"No need to thank me. It's what any responsible citizen should do,"
Lumian replied with a smile.

Soon, the other soldiers discovered traces of corrosion and scales on
the ground, along with sticky liquid that hadn't entirely evaporated.
They followed the trail towards the docks.

Lumian clicked his tongue and continued on his way towards the public
carriage stop.

*Clap! Clap! Clap! *He heard a soft applause.

Feeling uneasy, Lumian turned his head and saw someone sitting on a
nearby cargo box, seemingly having appeared out of nowhere.

The man's eyebrows were charred yellow, and his hair shared the same
color. His eyes were dark blue yet radiant. He wore a linen shirt, a
brown vest, and a pair of black leather boots hung from his dark brown
pants.

Lumian recognized the man and felt alarmed.

Blazing Danitz, a great pirate second only to a few Pirate Kings!

But Lumian calmed down when he recalled the man's other identity: He was
no longer a pirate; he was now Mr. Fool's Oracle!

As the holder of a Minor Arcana card, Lumian believed that as long as he
revealed his identity, Blazing Danitz wouldn't give him trouble.

Blazing Danitz gazed at Lumian for a few seconds before effortlessly
leaping down from the top of the wooden crates.

He chuckled and spoke leisurely, "To be able to swiftly choose the most
effective, targeted, and efficient attack method against your prey,
perfectly evading the enemy's enhanced scale defense---your combat
intelligence is quite impressive. I admire it.

"So, how about it? Are you interested in joining my team and becoming my
subordinate?"
