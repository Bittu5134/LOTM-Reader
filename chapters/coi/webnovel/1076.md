## Chapter 1076: Savant

"3: Every three minutes, this mask drains life force from its wearer;

"When the mask's life force drops below a certain threshold, it will
drain life force from living beings within a five-kilometer radius to
replenish itself;

"The rate at which the mask's life force decreases depends on frequency
of use. If left unused, it can last up to seven days. If used frequently
and unable to replenish life force from the wearer, it can only last 45
minutes;

"The mask possesses living characteristics. Even when in use, it must be
closely monitored, otherwise it will attack the wearer and their
companions;

"The mask yearns for a complete body. It will entice the wearer and
those around them to gradually replace their bodies with mechanical
constructs;

"Those enticed by it will not have their life force drained, nor will
they be attacked by it.

"4: The method of sealing is to let it sleep, replenishing its life
force at regular intervals, with specific timing depending on usage
conditions;

"It can be persuaded."

A Sealed Artifact that can be persuaded and possesses living
characteristics? After hearing Franca's relay of information, Lumian
extended his right hand toward the Face of the Arcane that she was
holding.

During this process, he had already activated the residual aura of the
Blood Emperor in his palm, along with the Underworld Daoist's seal and
that terrifying black pinhole appearing.

On the mechanical mask that only covered the left half of the face, the
springs, mainsprings, rivets, gears, and other components suddenly
appeared to lose their elasticity, gradually relaxing.

It was like watching a snarling puppy quickly lying down, legs up in the
air, exposing its belly.

Lumian stroked it a couple of times with his finger and said with a
smile, "It can indeed be persuaded."

At this moment, Ludwig came over, staring eagerly at the Face of the
Arcane, and asked, "Can I eat it?"

He wasn't asking if the mechanical mask was edible, but rather if he
himself was allowed to eat it.

On the Face of the Arcane, whether springs, mainsprings, gears, or
bearings, everything suddenly tightened with a swoosh, making the sound
of machinery starting up.

"No," Lumian answered Ludwig's question.

After becoming a Sea Monster, Ludwig seemed able to directly consume
Beyonder characteristics and mystical items, then use their
corresponding powers through some method.

He wouldn't lose control from this, but it would accumulate madness and
appetite.

Disappointed, Ludwig pulled out a lollipop, comforting himself with the
sweet treat.

"Being able to be persuaded means it can be reasoned with. Isn't
sleeping once a day a normal living habit?" Lumian said with a smile as
he withdrew his finger. "Before long, Anthony should be able to become a
Sequence 4 Manipulator. When that time comes, if the child doesn't want
to sleep, we can Hypnotize it to sleep. Children who don't sleep will be
eaten by Ludwig."

As for the requirement of regularly replenishing life force, Lumian
thought it was easily solved---he now had to take Ludwig out to sea for
a feast every day.

After confirming that the Face of the Arcane had lulled itself to sleep,
Franca handed this Grade 1 Sealed Artifact to Jenna. "You keep it safe.
Whoever needs it between us can use it."

Jenna didn't refuse, and while placing the Face of the Arcane into the
Traveler's Bag, she thoughtfully said, "I know which pathway Julien
should take."

"Which one?" Franca had a vague guess at the answer.

Jenna let out a sigh and explained, "Savant."

She explained earnestly, seemingly trying to convince herself, "The
Savant pathway primarily focuses on mastering scientific knowledge,
enhancing memory, intelligence, and logical reasoning abilities. Unlike
the Mystery Pryer and many other pathways, it doesn't involve high
spirituality, seeing things that shouldn't be seen, or hearing voices
that shouldn't be heard. It also doesn't attract disasters, making it
relatively safe for daily life.

"Moreover, Julien is already a technical worker who loves machinery.
With just one or two months of additional knowledge, he should be able
to fully digest the potion. The subsequent Archaeologist Sequence is
equally straightforward---we can find relatively safe ruins for him to
explore, provide him with carefully selected historical artifacts and
corresponding documentation to guide his research.

"Given these conditions, plus the approaching apocalypse as a
prerequisite, he could become a Sequence 7 Appraiser in a short time.
While an Appraiser isn't particularly strong on their own, they can
identify mystical items and maximize risk avoidance when using them. At
that point, by giving him Sequence 5 Sealed Artifacts, we can provide
him with basic self-protection abilities, essentially making him
equivalent to a quickly-molded Sequence 5 Beyonder.

"Additionally, among the Mid- to Low-Sequence Beyonder characteristics
and potion formulas I obtained from the Moses Ascetic Order this time,
the Savant pathway ingredients are the most numerous after the Warlock
pathway."

There was no shortage of ingredients and formulas.

"When you think about it, the Savant pathway is indeed the most
suitable. It can effectively leverage external power without reckless
archaeology, while avoiding too deep an involvement in the mystical
world," Franca agreed with Jenna's reasoning.

Lumian then said to Jenna, "You can modify your previous plan now. The
key is how to naturally and reasonably get your brother to encounter and
choose the Savant pathway."

"Yes," Jenna nodded seriously.

†

Thursday afternoon, Northern Trier Train Station.

Julien, wearing a gray-blue worker's uniform, a flat cap, and carrying a
suitcase, stood in the crowded second-class carriage aisle, slowly
moving forward amid the whistling arrival announcement.

Standing nearly 1.75 meters tall, with flaxen hair and regular features,
his half-year exchange study had greatly boosted his confidence in his
technical abilities. His entire demeanor, from temperament to behavior,
exuded ambition.

He believed he would soon be valued highly, receive promotions in rank
and salary, and before long become the kind of senior worker who could
take on apprentices.

*Once my salary increases, we can move away from Rue Pasteur to a better
neighborhood, and Celia wouldn't need to work part-time anymore---she
could focus on studying dramatic performance...* Thinking of the
bright future, Julien walked with straight posture, each step in his
gait firm and steady.

Following the flow of people, Julien exited the steam train and the
relatively clean platform, entered the Northern Train Station, and
passed through the turnstiles.

He looked around, searching for his sister who had promised to meet him.

As he searched, he noticed many travelers unconsciously gazing toward
one corner, reluctant to look away, with some even walking in that
direction.

Though curious, Julien didn't go to see what the commotion was about.

Meeting up with Celia was the most important thing right now!

After walking several more steps, he finally spotted the familiar
figure.

She was also the person drawing all those gazes.

Julien saw that his sister Celia Bello's flaxen hair had darkened
considerably and was tied in a simple bun. Her face wore no makeup yet
appeared fresh and clean, like a flower newly washed by rain.

*Celia seems to have grown even prettier, more beautiful than Mom's
photos when she was young...* Julien quickly squeezed through,
blocking a man who was trying to chat up his sister.

"Welcome home!" Jenna gave her brother a hug.

Meanwhile, she grumbled inwardly, *It's really inconvenient for a
Demoness to go out without concealing her appearance. Even with using
Lie to adjust my features to look more like before and having suppressed
my charm, I still draw attention, though not as drastically...*

"Let's go," Julien glanced at the eager men around them and protectively
guided his sister quickly out of the Northern Train Station.

Jenna pointed to a double-decker public horse carriage. "This one's
already full, let's wait for the next one."

Julien looked around and pointed to the rental carriage lane. "Let's
take one of those back. I've saved some money during this time."

He had expected his frugal sister to object and need convincing, but to
his surprise, Jenna immediately nodded in agreement.

Julien felt that his sister must have changed quite a bit over these six
months.

After settling into the two-wheeled, two-seater rental carriage, Jenna
asked with a smile, "How did your studies go? Your letters weren't very
detailed about it."

Julien instinctively straightened his back. "I think I'm about at the
same level as the master who taught me before."

He went on to explain many technical details, though Jenna couldn't
understand them.

Jenna offered some complimentary remarks before changing the subject, "I
recently met an outstanding technical expert. She says she's a technical
expert---I don't understand much about it, but when she repairs
machines, she's really incredible, the kind of incredible that even I
can recognize.

"She said when you return, everyone could get together to exchange
ideas."

*She?* Julien relaxed.

With a smile, he said, "Sure, you can arrange a time with her."

He was very confident in his technical skills now.

"Let's go right after you put away your luggage---we'll have dinner
together!" Jenna quickly decided, as if her previous words had been
leading up to this.

Julien gave his sister a suspicious look, suspecting she was trying to
set him up.

However, after their long separation, he didn't want to refuse.

After dropping off his luggage at their rental place on Rue Pasteur,
Jenna led Julien to a newly built factory on the south side of Quartier
du Jardin Botanique.

Inside the factory, a young woman with short hair and goggles was using
a hammer, pliers, and other tools to work on a giant machine,
continuously installing rivets, levers, bearings, and other components.

Her movements were fluid and unassuming, but every detail was perfect,
not a fraction off, without the slightest error.

As Julien watched, he became transfixed, his previously high confidence
gradually crumbling.

*Is this even humanly possible?*

*Even machines manufacturing machines can't achieve this level of
precision!*

*Could this be the blessing of the God of Technology that the Church of
Steam preaches about?*

When the woman finished her work, Jenna stepped forward and called out
with a smile, "Good afternoon, Miss Bella."

Bella's body instinctively trembled slightly, then she turned around and
said with a smile,

"Celia, is this your brother?"

"Yes, my brother Julien." Jenna made the introduction.

Julien nodded bewilderedly, his previous confidence completely gone.
