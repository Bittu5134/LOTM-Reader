## Chapter 985: I Don't Believe It

Hearing Luo Shan's question, Jenna was stunned.

*Why would she suddenly ask such a question?*

*How did she suddenly think this was a dream?*

*How did she know? Who told her?*

After coming to her senses, Jenna carefully asked in return, "What
dream?"

Luo Shan looked at her for several seconds. "A Reporter has an ability
to observe the truth, to see different scenes within a certain area, but
it can't be maintained for too long. I've been using it often lately to
check if anyone is hiding in my home or if there are any traps.

"When I came back in the evening, I used it once and saw you and Luo Fu
talking. I heard Luo Fu asking about being kicked out of the dream."

*So that's how it is... So that's what observing the truth
means...* Jenna's first reaction was "Don't panic, I'll make up
a reason on the spot," but after seeing Luo Shan's eyes filled with deep
sadness, confusion, and pain, she closed her mouth and remained silent.

Luo Shan took a moment before saying, "So, when Luo Fu suddenly became
like a different person last time, it was because the consciousness from
outside the dream was kicked out?

"So... this really is a dream?"

Jenna remained silent for several seconds, her tone becoming somber.
"This is Zhou Mingrui's dream."

Luo Shan opened her mouth, but couldn't say anything. Her expression
gradually became vacant.

Jenna continued, "Some people want Zhou Mingrui to continue sleeping
until the apocalypse comes, while others want to wake him up so he can
lead everyone to resist the apocalypse."

As she said these words, Jenna felt sympathy for Luo Shan while keeping
her mind highly focused, waiting for the possible dream rejection that
might come.

She had almost revealed the essence of the matter.

With Lumina already kicked out of the dream, Franca ill, and the police
department highly focused on the horrible case of Zaratulstra's
shooting, Jenna wasn't prepared to conduct further experiments.

Even if she wanted to experiment, the target would be Peng Deng or Zhou
Mingrui. It was unlikely to reveal the truth to Luo Shan now. That would
require a gradual, step-by-step approach.

No one would accept that they were fake, that their existence was
meaningless. This would cause unpredictable shock to Luo Shan. Jenna
could hardly imagine what kind of changes this would cause in Luo Shan.

Compared to this, being kicked out of the dream wasn't a particularly
serious problem. After all, she could enter again.

Of course, it would be best not to be kicked out. Otherwise, the weak
and sick Franca might not be able to control Lumina and prevent her from
secretly going to Mushu Hospital.

Luo Shan's lips trembled for a while before she finally said, "So, I'm
just an illusory figure in someone else's dream?"

Before Jenna could respond, Luo Shan raised her hand to touch her own
face, then suddenly shook her head. "I don't believe it... I don't
believe it... I don't believe it! This isn't a dream, and I'm not fake!"

At this moment, Jenna wanted to persuade her to shift her attention, to
find new meaning, but the words caught in her throat and she couldn't
form a sentence.

Luo Shan cried out for a while before finally calming down.

She looked at Jenna again and said, "Every time, every time I observe
the truth, I see grayish-white fog. It's in every scene. Wh-what is it?"

Jenna pondered for a moment and then said, "It might be, it might be the
boundaries of the dream."

Luo Shan fell silent again, staring intently at Jenna's eyes as if
grasping at the last straw.

She slowly lowered her head, turning her body while mumbling, "No, it's
not like this... I don't believe it...

"I don't believe it..."

She completely turned her back on Jenna, facing the translucent barrier
and the monsters hiding in the deep darkness beyond it alone.

___

Trier, beside the Srenzo River, in a café with outdoor seating.

Lumian wore sunglasses and had long hair draped over his shoulders.
Basking in the bright sunlight, he held a cup of Intis coffee, his mind
wandering as he gazed at the wide river, the classical buildings on the
opposite shore, the steam-belching iron ships, the bustling and lively
river island, and the occasional airship passing by, enjoying a rare
moment of leisure.

He temporarily had nothing that needed to be done.

He had originally planned to take advantage of his return to the real
world to visit Bansy Island, seeking special scenes that could maximize
the effectiveness of the corpse wax candle. But after careful
consideration, he abandoned this plan.

There were uncertain risks in Bansy Harbor. If it led to him being
trapped there, unable to enter Mr. Fool's true dream, or directly
resulting in his death, it would significantly affect the subsequent
progress of the awakening plan.

Lumian was clear about which of these two matters was more important.

He had also considered whether to go to the New City of Silver, enter
the underground, and borrow the Grade 0 Sealed Artifact---Gift of the
Land---to bring it into the dream city, enhancing the team's power.
After all, for him, he could return to Mr. Fool's dream using the lucky
coin regardless of where he fell asleep, and the New City of Silver was
also a safe place.

In the end, Lumian erred on the side of caution and didn't make this
risky attempt.

He carried Omebella's bloodline, and in the dream city, those blessed by
the Great Mother like Grimm viewed him as the Great Mother's Child of
God. The underground of Mushu Hospital still concealed the Great
Mother's influence and erosion of the dream city. If he added the Gift
of the Land transformed from the real Omebella's remains on top of that,
Lumian dared not imagine what problems might arise.

He worried that as soon as he brought the Gift of the Land into the
dream city, he might find his dream manifestation appearing in basement
one of Mushu Hospital, with the Gift of the Land fusing with his body,
allowing Omebella to be fully reborn.

And such an Omebella might be able to withstand the divine descent of
the Great Mother.

Unable to do this or that, Lumian could only give himself a day off. As
for making new Ice Mirror Charms, he had to wait a bit longer, because
his misfortune had not completely dissipated.

Yes, although he had used Circle Inhabitant within the dream city, after
returning to reality, he still bore the negative effect of misfortune.

Correspondingly, he could only use the Circle of Binding effect of his
Circle Inhabitant seven more times, and using Circle Inhabitant twice
had stacked his misfortune to six hours, which didn't take effect
immediately.

The types of Circle Inhabitant he used on Zaratulstra's mirror
projection and Historical Void image were not the same. One was to
recreate the scene, the other was to fix the position.

*Is the essence of negative effects reflecting in reality that using
Beyonder items in dreams causes Beyonder items in reality to be
activated as well, thus producing corresponding negative
effects?* Lumian took a sip of coffee, allowing his body and
mind to relax.

He silently sighed. *A rare moment of leisure in this fleeting
life...*

After a while, Lumian gazed at the gently rippling, relatively clean
water surface, breathing in the cool breeze from the river, and
spontaneously thought, *Is the other 'me' also daydreaming like this
now?*

He had considered the problem of identity conflict corresponding to his
female form being kicked out of the dream, but he hadn't reminded Jenna
and Franca about it, only telling them to be careful of the influence
brought by Omebella's bloodline.

He felt that this situation might gradually awaken some of Aurore's
qualities in his dream self.

___

At 8 am, Dechuang Garden.

Franca had just groggily woken up when she saw Lumina standing by the
bay window, looking at the already brilliant sunlight outside, lost in
thought.

After a night's rest, Franca's condition had improved considerably. She
was no longer weak all over, and walking was no longer a problem.

"What... are you looking at?" she tentatively asked Lumina.

Lumina didn't turn around, her tone slightly distant as she said, "I
really want to go for a walk. It's not too hot at this time."

"Let's wait for things to blow over," Franca suggested. "How about we
play computer games?"

"What games?" Lumina turned around.

"..." Franca suddenly fell silent.

Without a computer, what computer games could they play?

They didn't even have a gaming console!

They had to save every penny for when they needed to rent useful items
from the Star Dream Provisions Store or complete crucial tasks. In daily
life, non-essential expenses were always cut wherever possible.

"Mobile games then..." As she spoke, Franca stopped again.

What games wouldn't lag on their cheap phones?

"Let's play Fighting the Landlord!" That was all she could say.

At this moment, Jenna walked in, supporting Franca to the bathroom to
wash up.

After closing the bathroom door, Jenna kept an ear out for any movement
outside, worried that Lumina might suddenly run out, while lowering her
voice to tell Franca about Luo Shan's situation.

Franca sat on the toilet, her mouth half-open, completely stunned.

After hearing Jenna's full explanation, she sighed deeply.

"We still don't understand enough about the abilities of the Reporter
Sequence..."

She could understand how Luo Shan felt now. If someone with authority
told her that her life since transmigrating was fake, that her past was
also fake, that she was just an illusory character existing in a dream,
she would certainly suffer a huge blow. Not having a breakdown on the
spot was already quite good.

Even though they had thought about using Luo Shan to awaken Mr. Fool,
Franca had previously hoped to persuade her with fabricated stories, not
to tell her the truth.

Some truths were best never known.

They represented despair.

Franca pondered for a moment, then said desperately, "Can we find an
excuse to cover it up? Not saying we lied to her, but designing some
events to let everyone 'discover' together that the dream theory is just
another layer of disguise, not the final truth. I think Luo Shan could
accept such a development. People can deceive themselves about certain
things. Hasn't she been saying she doesn't believe this is a dream?

"Moreover, we can't provide strong enough evidence to prove this is a
dream!"

Jenna fell silent for a moment before saying, "We can only handle it
this way for now. During this period, we need to find a way for Anthony
to placate Luo Shan, or have him provide treatment directly."

Franca nodded lightly, suddenly showing a thoughtful expression.

She looked at Jenna and said slowly, "Based on our previous speculation,
Luo Shan is a dream character shaped by Mr. Fool's divided subconscious,
combined with corresponding images from memory. In a broad sense, she is
equivalent to a part of Mr. Fool.

"After hearing the truth about the dream, the dream city didn't show any
unusual changes, and you weren't kicked out of the dream..."
