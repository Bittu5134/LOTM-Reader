## Chapter 705: Past

After the waiter left their secluded table with the order, Lumian picked
up his tri-colored liqueur---a vibrant mix of red, white, and blue---and
clinked glasses with Franca before taking a sip.

Glancing around to ensure no one could overhear, he quietly recounted
the detailed fate fragments of Moran Avigny. As Franca listened, her
expression gradually morphed, a frown creasing her lovely brow.

"That white, thin fog you described... it reminds me of something," she
said. "Does it have a mercurial, ever-shifting nature?"

Lumian considered briefly before nodding. "Yes, it does."

Franca let out a soft sigh. "It must be the same phenomenon then. You
know how I told you about Jenna and I getting tailed by that entrustee
of the vanished Deep Valley Cloister gatekeeper at the mysticism
gathering? The one we ended up fighting?

"Well, when I channeled the guy's spirit and asked about his
organizational ties, his physical form and spirit abruptly detonated. My
mirror cracked from the blast, but right before shattering, it filled
with that same thin, mercurial white mist."

Franca paused, collecting her thoughts.

"According to the intel I passed along, 007 ran into a similar fog
during their investigation of Deep Valley Town. Albert Goncourt, the
Carbonari's leader, was spotted there too.

"As you're aware, the Carbonari played a role in stoking the riots
during the Hostel plan. Their other leader, operating under the alias
General Philip, spearheaded that particular scheme."

Lumian swiftly connected the dots Franca was laying out.

"So you suspect the Carbonari is in league with multiple evil god cults,
this peculiar white fog being tied to one of them---and that Moran
Avigny is also entangled with this group. Meaning our supposedly chance
encounter with him in the West Lognes Forest was anything but."

"Precisely." Franca took another sip of her liqueur. "And what's the
ultimate endgame for these Mirror People? Surely not mere replacement of
their originals."

The mirror version of Gardner Martin had failed to succeed the real one,
understandably using the Hostel plan to deal with his counterpart. But
Moran Avigny, also a Mirror Person, had quietly replaced the original
for decades, even fathering an illegitimate daughter and living a cushy
life. Why collaborate with cults?

Smiling, Lumian replied, "The goals of Mirror People as a whole versus
as individuals are bound to differ. Investigating should reveal the
former. Back in Fourth Epoch Trier, Mirror Gardner Martin mentioned
their loyalty and service to someone who holds all the answers. Learning
that person's identity should tell us the Mirror People's endgame."

Franca concurred succinctly, "We can plan our next moves around this
strange fog. Deal with Moran Avigny to get more info on the Mirror
People, which is already a lead. And capturing him or channeling his
spirit could present other opportunities."

Franca smiled. "Looks like 007 will be busy again."

Their discussion of Moran Avigny complete, Lumian picked up some roasted
pre-meal bread, chewing as he recounted his encounter with Courtesan
Perle and the coffee ground divination he'd witnessed.

"She's unlikely to be a Demoness," Franca concluded, a hint of
disappointment in her voice.

Based on Lumian's description and reaction to Perle's appearance, she
could tell the courtesan wasn't a Demoness.

Unless deliberately feigning ugliness, a Demoness's charms were
impossible to conceal. Even gay men couldn't resist sneaking a few extra
glances.

"Definitely not..." Lumian suddenly paused, remembering something.

Shifting to casual conversation, he asked, "Does coffee ground
divination actually hold mystical significance? Can it truly provide
revelation?"

Franca finished her bread, took another sip of the colorful liqueur, and
smiled. "Of course mysticism is involved."

Noting Lumian's lack of divination knowledge compared to his skill in
reading fate, Franca explained with a smug grin.

"You don't need to put divination on some holy, unattainable pedestal.

"Our Astral Projections constantly interact with the spirit world,
obtaining information and receiving revelations. These get reflected in
reality through various forms.

"It's true for both Beyonders and ordinary people. But those unskilled
in divination struggle to proactively obtain revelations or effectively
interpret them.

"For example, if a Beyonder chokes on a fishbone while eating, they'll
quickly realize it's a warning from their spirit, containing a
revelation needing interpretation. But if regular folks have the same
experience, they'll just think they were unlucky or careless. It won't
stand out enough to warrant deeper consideration or deciphering.

"Of course, getting a stuck fishbone doesn't always indicate a spiritual
warning. Usually it's just lack of care. Skilled diviners can tell the
difference between a true revelation and a random occurrence. The
unskilled tend to overthink, scaring themselves while ignoring what's
truly concerning."

Given their upcoming fish course, Franca had used a relatable example.

Lumian nodded, gaining a clearer understanding of divination.

He asked thoughtfully, "So without deliberate control over the drinking
method, coffee ground patterns can reveal something---but ordinary
people's interpretations may be inaccurate?"

"Precisely!" Franca said excitedly. "In the most rational environment,
the decades-popular coffee ground divination can come extremely close to
reality. Each divination session can refine the standard interpretations
until the meaning of every ground formation is definitively established.
Then even regular people could interpret with reasonable accuracy.

"Sadly, reality is no bastion of pure rationality. Believers in coffee
divination subconsciously work to make even mistaken interpretations
come true. Non-believers plainly see the interpretations don't match up.
These conflicting approaches get all tangled together, preventing the
codification of standard, reliable answers. In the end, it's just a
game."

As they conversed, the waiter served the various dishes, clearing used
plates as part of the set procedure.

The fried Fürth fish arrived as a later main course.

Lumian cut a piece and tasted it---tender flesh with an intriguing blend
of charred and oily notes, the pepper and salt seasoning just right.

"Delicious," Franca praised. "And warming too."

Lumian also felt a current of warmth spread through him as the Fürth
fish reached his stomach.

"Some special ingredients indeed," he concluded, teasing Franca. "Just
don't eat too fast---wouldn't want you choking on a bone."

Franca laughed. "You think a few bones can choke me?"

Glancing around to confirm the waiter's departure, she asked,

"I've been pondering something the last couple days. I still can't grasp
the difference between using rituals and curses to influence a target's
future fate versus directly compelling a fate change.

"I get the ritual part---it relies on the target's blood, close
relatives, certain items, and mystically significant contact to alter
their future fate. But how is that different from a curse?"

Lumian organized his thoughts before explaining.

"In the mysticism knowledge of Fate Appropriators, a curse is a curse of
fate. Compared to rituals, curses are simpler, with fewer required
conditions. But that significantly limits the ultimate effect. Nothing
too outlandish can be achieved.

"Many bestowed of Inevitability like to call this type of curse
Magnified Fate.

"It can only target fate tributaries within the next ten seconds, and
must align with the current environment and circumstances. Meeting those
prerequisites enables the fate curse to succeed. And the targeted fate
tributary needs a certain probability of manifesting in the first place,
or the success rate plummets.

"Simply put, one first uses or alters the environment to enable certain
possibilities, then magnifies those possibilities---assuming they
weren't extremely unlikely to begin with."

Lumian looked at Franca, raising his right palm to gesture as he
mischievously provided an example.

"For instance, while you're eating fish, I could use a curse to magnify
the chance of you choking on a bone. But I couldn't magnify the chance
of your chair suddenly collapsing, impaling you with wood splinters."

The moment he finished speaking, Franca froze, gasping twice as her
throat worked. Within seconds, she spat out a bloody fishbone.

"You actually did it?" Franca grumbled. "Luckily my Sequence grants
strong throat control. I handled it myself. Uh..." Franca suddenly
paused. After a few seconds, she said, "Otherwise we'd be seeking a
doctor's aid. How embarrassing would that be!"

Lumian chuckled. "I could've helped pull it out, magnifying the fate
tributary of successful extraction."

Franca was briefly speechless.

After eating another bite of Fürth fish, she nodded.

"I understand the differences now.

"Curses, or Magnify, suit combat. They're mainly for interfering with
and influencing enemies, not accomplishing anything too exaggerated.

"Rituals are done in advance. With the right items, they can largely
steer a target's fate as desired."

"But only in a general direction," Lumian added. "No real precision. I
could make someone have a bad day, but not dictate the exact flavor of
misfortune."

Franca nodded.

"So compelling fate is like a streamlined ritual for live combat that
still packs a punch?"

"Perhaps even stronger and more precise effects," Lumian mused. "Plus,
many abilities transformed in unique ways when Fate Appropriator and
Reaper fused, bringing with them the relevant mystical knowledge. I
can't fully distinguish the inherent from the individualized---I only
know the Eye of Calamity and Compelling Fate came from Reaper."

They enjoyed the rest of their lunch. As the meal concluded, Lumian
pointed to the half-eaten Fürth fish, instructing the waiter, "I'd like
this wrapped up to go."

The waiter complied respectfully without question. Franca smiled
teasingly. "How frugal of you."

Lumian chuckled. "This is expected of a godfather. Besides, I'm curious
what makes this fish so special."
