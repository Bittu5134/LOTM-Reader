## Chapter 259: Awe

Hugues Artois's initial reaction was one of surprise and confusion as he
beheld the glimmering silver light emanating from the long-handled fork,
thrusting menacingly towards him.

He found it hard to fathom that someone would attempt to assassinate
him, a well-protected member of parliament, under these circumstances.

The assassin didn't appear particularly formidable.

Despite being a retired veteran, he had left military service five years
ago to pursue a career in politics. His combat skills were no longer
honed. With the adversary a mere step apart, evading the attack
effectively seemed impossible.

Disregarding him, even a Sequence 9 or even a Sequence 8 Beyonder would
likely struggle to dodge a Mighty Blow from an Assassin, especially one
who had stealthily approached them. It all depended on whether their
abilities could help them avoid vital areas or reduce the damage, thus
preventing instant death.

Naturally, some Sequence 8 or 9 Beyonders possessed the ability to sense
danger or hostility ahead of time, thwarting the approach and attack of
Assassins.

In an instant, Hugues Artois cast his gaze upon the red-haired
Cassandra, the three official Beyonders, and his subordinates Rhône,
Margaret, and Boduva, feeling intense fear grip him.

However, what met his eyes was Cassandra's red hair---her body and line
of sight obscured by the mixed-blood Imre---as well as the calm and
indifferent gazes of the official Beyonders, Imre and Antoine. Valentine
had reacted immediately but restrained himself, and Rhône, Margaret, and
Boduva, though eager to use their Beyonder powers to save him, dared not
expose their boons obtained from the evil gods.

At that moment, Hugues Artois was overwhelmed by a profound sense of
despair.

*You all, save me!*

*Save me!*

With a squelching sound, the long-handled silver fork plunged
mercilessly into Hugues Artois's right eye, propelled with all the force
Jenna could muster. It pierced through the eye socket, penetrating the
brain, with only a small portion of the handle protruding outside.

Hugues Artois's thoughts became hazy.

He yearned to reach out and grasp something, but his arm wouldn't even
rise.

*I haven't become president... I haven't witnessed the arrival of great
existences... I haven't received the boon of godhood... I cannot die
like this... Slain by a feeble Assassin... I-I don't wish to
perish...* A barrage of thoughts flashed through Hugues Artois's
mind as gunshots resounded in his ears.

His body slumped to the ground, and darkness enveloped his vision once
more.

Thud. Hugues Artois, member of parliament for Le Marché du Quartier du
Gentleman, collapsed onto the ground, his heart ceasing to beat.

Jenna, her eyes shut and a smile adorning her face, was struck by
bullets fired by nearby Bureau 7 agents.

One bullet struck her shoulder, and another pierced her ribs from the
opposite side.

The pain contorted her expression instinctively. Her body involuntarily
recoiled, as if she wished to curl up into a protective ball.

She opened her eyes and beheld Rhône and the other devotees of the evil
gods glaring at her with hatred and an unnatural panic, yet refraining
from attacking.

In the next instant, a golden revolver, its chamber loaded, pressed
against Jenna's head. Imre surveyed the room and declared, "I have
already subdued the assassin. Verify if Monsieur Member of Parliament
can be saved and maintain order. No one should leave for the time
being."

He made it clear that he intended to escort Jenna back to Église
Saint-Robert or inquire on the spot about the motive behind the
assassination and the mastermind, preventing Cassandra and the others
from venting their rage.

As the Tree of Shadow descended, the various streets reverted to their
original state, yet they remained engulfed in wilderness.

Lumian perceived that Susanna Mattise could no longer stir his desires
from a distance as she did before. So, he turned around, intending to
confront Charlotte first.

The crimson flames enveloping his body burned with intensity, scorching
his garments and searing his skin and flesh to varying degrees,
inflicting constant pain.

This torment stimulated his mind, allowing him to maintain a certain
level of clarity. He could also rely on the endurance bestowed by the
Alms Monk boon to sustain his thoughts and actions, instead of merely
focusing on enduring the agony.

Even for Pyromaniacs, such incineration posed a threat. Moreover, as
time passed, the damage would worsen, eventually endangering their
lives.

Of course, long before that point, Lumian's spirituality would likely
crumble. He could only allow the flames to extinguish on their own.

Were it not for the Alms Monk boon and the internal struggle within the
Tree of Shadow, his spirituality would have been strained by the
self-immolation.

Upon seeing Lumian turn and observe "Red Boots" Franca dashing toward
her with a brass classic revolver, sliding across a layer of frost
formed beneath her feet, Charlotte abandoned her plans for a surprise
attack. Instead, she readied herself to return to the Tree of Shadow,
where she could exploit the environment and enhance her abilities to
confront the enemy.

Her body instantaneously grew pliable, as though secreting a slimy
substance.

She "acted" as a serpent-like creature, utilizing the intertwining vines
and branches to swiftly retreat toward the brownish-green tree.

At that moment, Charlotte's body froze.

It was akin to facing a dragon head-on, confronting a predator at the
apex of the biological hierarchy. She couldn't help but tremble with
fear and overwhelming panic.

She circled her immediate vicinity and ran haphazardly, as if fleeing
from an unseen adversary.

Not far from her, Anthony Reid, the information broker, emerged from
behind an iron-black gas street lamp post, suspended by the vines and
branches of the Auberge du Coq Doré.

At some point, his dark brown eyes had transformed into a pale golden
hue, adopting a vertical orientation.

He was a Psychiatrist, a Sequence 7 Psychiatrist of the Spectator
pathway.

He had just employed Awe!

In ancient times, it was referred to as Dragon Might!

The brownish-green vines and branches surrounding Anthony Reid,
manipulated by Susanna rather than the Tree of Shadow, cowered and
retreated from him.

Observing Charlotte's descent into madness and confusion, rendering her
unable to evade Lumian's attacks, Susanna, who desperately absorbed
vitality, narrowed her eyes and cursed, unable to conceal her
deep-seated hatred.

"You shall all perish. Today, you shall all meet your demise!"

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! On the Tree of Shadow, new tree trunks distinct
from the main body shot forth like javelins, aimed at impaling Lumian in
the midst of the wilderness.

Apart from utilizing the abilities of the Fallen Tree Spirit, Susanna
Mattise had not yet regained sufficient strength to affect targets
dozens or even nearly a hundred meters away.

Lumian had foreseen this. With a roll, he positioned himself within the
area where Charlotte aimlessly fled.

*Thud! Thud! Thud! *The tree trunk javelins impaled the ground
nearby, pounding the wilderness like hammers.

Lumian rose to his feet, engulfed in crimson flames. He extended his
arms slightly and let out a boisterous laugh.

"Bring it on, kill me!"

If Susanna were to blanket the area with relentless assaults once again,
he could still find a way to evade them. However, Charlotte, lost in her
state of confusion, would undoubtedly meet her demise!

As he bellowed, half-illusory crimson Fire Ravens materialized behind
Lumian. They circled and traced multiple trajectories, fixating their
sights on Charlotte Calvino.

The branches and vines on the ground surged wildly, swiftly ensnaring
Charlotte, shielding her from harm.

A series of thunderous sounds resounded as the crimson Fire Ravens
descended upon Charlotte, shattering tree branches and igniting vines,
systematically stripping away layer after layer of the Actor's outer
shell.

*Bang!*

Franca, who had closed the distance, stepped in and extended her right
hand, firmly squeezing the trigger.

An iron-black bullet flew from the classic brass revolver and struck
Charlotte's head with precision, piercing through the gap created by the
Fire Ravens.

The enchanting, pure, and delicate visage instantly shattered, with red
and white fluids splattering forth from her eyes, nose, and mouth.

With only its severed head remaining, the lifeless body stumbled a few
steps in confusion before finally collapsing to the ground.

"Go to hell!" Susanna roared.

With that cry, brown branches, green vines, thick limbs, and
pale-colored blossoms surged forth in a multitude of forms, converging
upon Lumian, Franca, and Anthony.

Despite the nightmarish scene unfolding before them, Lumian sensed no
immediate peril.

Until Susanna Mattise regained a certain level of strength, an attack
that consumed a significant amount of spirituality posed no true threat.

Lumian charged forward once more, carrying the crimson flames that
devoured his flesh, venturing deeper into the primordial forest-like
setting.

Vines ignited, flowers turned to ash, branches charred, yet none impeded
the enemy's advance toward the Tree of Shadow.

Suddenly, the objects recoiled, drawing the suspended human captives
back into the embrace of the Tree of Shadow.

Susanna had thought it through. There was no need to squander energy
merely to vent her rage. It was wiser to await the approach of the three
prey, luring them into the range where desire could take hold, before
employing her most formidable abilities to deal with them.

She could not accept her current weakness. That was one of the reasons
why she refrained from invoking the incantation to seek assistance
initially.

Before dragging the offering into the Tree of Shadow, the Son of God
dared not reveal Himself in Trier. In the future, Susanna possessed a
measure of confidence and needed to push the offering to a certain
extent, securing the protection of the ritual. Only then could she
utilize her fusion with the Tree of Shadow to confront the Son of God.

The Son of God was astonishingly deranged. He would never restrain the
corruption He might inflict upon His subordinates.

As for Lady Moon, she had merely pledged to intercept potential
saboteurs temporarily. Susanna dared not permit devotees of other
deities to enter the Tree of Shadow.

*Thud, thud, thud.* Lumian raced through the abruptly vacated
wilderness and dilapidated streets, sprinting toward the brownish-green
tree. Franca and Anthony each selected their respective angles of attack
and followed suit from different directions.

The fortunate vendors, pedestrians, and tenants who had yet to be
ensnared by the branches and vines seized the opportunity to flee the
wilderness, making their way towards the outskirts.
