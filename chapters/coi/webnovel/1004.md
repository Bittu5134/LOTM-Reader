## Chapter 1004: The Solution

Seeing Zhou Mingrui looking at her, waiting for an answer, Luo Shan said
uncertainly, "It seems like things are back to normal..."

She had thought Zhou Mingrui wouldn't believe her judgment. After all,
they hadn't encountered anything or seen any signs of danger, and they
still didn't know if Luo Fu had been rescued. How could she say
everything was "back to normal"?

To her surprise, Zhou Mingrui nodded thoughtfully. "I think so too."

After a couple of seconds, Zhou Mingrui asked, "Do we still need to look
for Luo Fu?"

"I-I'll take another look..." Luo Shan cautiously walked to the edge of
the elevator lobby and peeked out.

She looked around and felt that aside from being too quiet with no one
passing through, there wasn't much difference between this underground
area and any other hospital basement.

Emergency Center, in a shadowy corner.

Lumian and Franca simultaneously saw Jenna, dressed in a nightgown, her
eyes dazed and unsure of what to do.

*She's been kicked out of the dream...* Both Lumian and Franca
quickly came to the same conclusion.

At that moment, Jenna also spotted Franca and Lumian. The tension and
worry in her heart suddenly eased.

Without saying much, Lumian grabbed Jenna's arm with his other hand and
disappeared with her into the edge of the shadows.

The three of them soon returned to Room 2303 in Dechuang Garden.

After checking the room's condition, Lumian said to Jenna, "Everything's
fine now. Get some rest."

He wasn't sure how the dream Jenna would "rationalize" what had just
happened, so he kept his explanation vague to avoid any cognitive
conflict.

As for the teleportation, it was impossible to hide it any longer. After
all, Zhou Mingrui had already become deeply aware of the supernatural
powers at play, and there were indeed quite a few Beyonders active in
the dream city.

Jenna, surprised, glanced around the familiar environment and obediently
replied, "Okay."

After she entered the room and lay down on the bed, Lumian closed the
bedroom door for her, then turned to Franca and said,

"Let's go back to Mushu Hospital now. We'll talk about what happened
once we're there."

Franca didn't ask why and slowly nodded.

Using teleportation, Lumian took Franca to the greenery outside Mushu
Hospital and turned his gaze towards the emergency center and the
hospital building.

Seeing the shattered glass and the scorched parts of the walls, Lumian
finally said to Franca, "I think what happened today was too much of a
coincidence. Zhou Mingrui came to investigate the situation at Mushu
Hospital, and at the same time, you ended up in the underground area."

"What exactly happened?"

Hearing the word "coincidence," Franca's emotions wavered slightly.

She pulled herself together and recounted how she and Jenna had found
themselves in the underground of Mushu Hospital after falling asleep,
how they encountered Luo Shan, her suspicions, and the psychological
traumas they later encountered.

"At the time, the corridor started collapsing." Franca stopped speaking
and fell silent again.

Lumian glanced at her but didn't press for details. Instead, he mused
aloud, "It really was a coincidence. If you look at the events
separately, it's logical that Zhou Mingrui, prompted by my warning
during the day and his own initiative, chose tonight to investigate
Mushu Hospital. Similarly, it's plausible that the force lurking in Luo
Shan's room or nearby, taking advantage of her psychological traumas and
the dream's nature, 'brought' you into the hospital's underground. Both
seem reasonable and could have happened naturally."

"But the fact that these two things happened at the same time and
influenced each other makes it obvious that something was off."

"And at the same time, I received a tipoff from Lu Yong'an and followed
Zhou Mingrui to sneak into Mushu Hospital."

Franca instinctively said, "But who could set up an arrangement for Zhou
Mingrui?"

"They didn't need to arrange him. Arranging us was enough." Lumian,
still in his Demoness of Despair state, let out a cold laugh. "When Zhou
Mingrui would investigate Mushu Hospital was uncertain, but once he was
spotted, they could trigger the other side."

"The force lurking in or near Luo Shan's room must have been there for a
while. Why didn't it act sooner or later? Why tonight?"

Franca fell silent for a moment, as if she had finally regained her
ability to think, and said, "Was Lu Yong'an arranged as well?"

"Not necessarily. It's possible they discovered my problem as a Child of
God and knew something would happen tonight, so they lured me in, using
your predicament to force me to become the true Child of God." After
thinking for a few seconds, Lumian added, "It's also likely that Lu
Yong'an isn't like Grimm, a dream persona influenced by the Great
Mother. She has an external consciousness."

At this point, Lumian paused, his gaze cold as he muttered to himself,
"A guardian for women and children..."

†

Inside Mushu Hospital, the power system of the building hadn't been
affected by the lightning strike. Only the ground separating the upper
and lower floors showed a very obvious charred area, and one of the
elevators had stopped functioning.

Lu Yong'an walked down the dimly lit corridor and reached a certain
room.

A wooden sign hung outside the door, with Chinese characters written on
it: "Dean's Office."

She knocked and entered, speaking to the person beside the shattered
glass window.

"She still didn't choose the Mother's help."

"I see," a voice responded.

Trier, inside a luxurious villa.

Jenna observed Franca's "sleeping state" while recounting their ordeal
and Franca's decisions to Madam Judgment, Madam Magician, and Madam
Justice.

After she finished, Madam Magician nodded thoughtfully and said, "It's
still unclear what exactly we were supposed to gain from tonight's
events, or what the true purpose was..."

Before she could finish her sentence, Madam Justice, looking at the
sleeping Franca, said,

"Two of Cups has left the underground area of Mushu Hospital. I can now
sense her and her surroundings."

Upon hearing this, Jenna's body swayed slightly, as if she had lost the
strength to even keep herself upright due to a sudden sense of relief.

Her breathing became heavy, and after a few seconds, she asked, "It's
over?"

"Not entirely," Madam Magician said, taking her gaze off the sleeping
Franca.

Jenna seemed to realize something and asked, with deep concern, "Right,
she held the ritual in the dream, cleverly advancing to Sequence 4 and
becoming a Demoness of Despair. It's unknown how long it will take her
to fully digest the Despair potion, and..."

Jenna suddenly stopped, unable to finish her sentence.

What she had been about to say was, "And our goal is to awaken Mr. Fool
as soon as possible, to end this dream, but that would conflict with the
conditions for Franca's survival."

In front of the Tarot Club's Major Arcana card holders, she dared not
utter those words, fearing the brutal answer she might receive.

Madam Justice gave a gentle smile, one with a bit of playful charm.

"I understand your concern, but that's not really an issue. Or, to put
it another way, it's not as serious as you think."

"Huh?" Jenna was surprised, both delighted and bewildered.

Madam Justice maintained her soft smile and explained, "First, Two of
Cups has already made considerable progress in digesting the Despair
potion. She's completed the part about 'making herself despair.' The
next step is to find opportunities to make others despair. If she can
refine her acting principles further during this process, the digestion
will go even faster."

Jenna blinked, confused.

"She's already digested nearly half of the Despair potion, right after
advancing?"

"Yes," Madam Magician agreed, her tone carrying an understanding note.
"It's quite similar to Lumian's situation at the time. Except Lumian
quickly made two boon demigods despair..."

"Exactly," Madam Magician continued, nodding knowingly. "Given the
nature of your circumstances and how things unfolded, it was almost
inevitable that people would fall into a state of despair. Mr. Fool's
psychological traumas may also contain elements that push Franca into
complete despair---things that sever her hopes and desires entirely."

Jenna's eyes moved slightly, and she muttered, "Quite the
coincidence..."

Madam Justice sighed with a smile. "Yes, that's one reason. But the
other reason why I said that Two of Cups' dream advancement isn't too
serious is because, given a little time---just a few minutes---she could
return to reality without dying, though there would be other costs."

"Really?" Jenna was both surprised and confused.

Madam Justice chuckled lightly and explained, "While we're limited in
what we can do, there are still many things we're capable of.

"For example, a Sun pathway Unshadowed can extract Beyonder
characteristics, even from a Beyonder, layer by layer, from high to low.
Though Two of Cups advanced in the dream, her reality also advanced,
which is why she can't leave the dream before fully digesting her
potion."

"In other words, we could have Mr. Sun extract the Demoness of Despair's
Beyonder characteristic from Two of Cups in reality, and I would
stabilize her mental state during the process. Once her body in reality
regresses to the level of a Demoness of Affliction, there would be no
more concern about her losing control upon leaving the dream."

"Of course, this solution would leave some problems behind, some quite
serious ones, which is why we didn't mention it as a solution before.
But compared to losing her life in the dream, these issues are
manageable."

Jenna stood there, dazed.

*The dream advancement affected reality, and regressing in reality would
cause a similar effect in the dream?*

*If you can't influence the dream, then change the state of
reality?*

Outside Mushu Hospital, in the greenery.

Hidden in the shadows, Lumian observed the hospital building, the
patients coming and going, and the emergency response personnel who had
just arrived, but he didn't spot any targets of note.

After a long silence, Franca finally spoke. "They might have already
left. Maybe they never showed up in the first place."

"Yeah, you could check some short videos. With the glass shattered and
the building struck by lightning, I'm sure a lot of people recorded it.
Maybe we'll find something."

"Right." Lumian took out his phone and began scrolling through local
news, not missing a single video.

When he reached a video titled "Oh my god, all the glass shattered," he
suddenly spotted a familiar figure in the corner of the frame, near the
edge of the emergency center.

That figure had messy blonde hair, blue eyes, short eyebrows, and a
clear stubble on his face. He was wearing a black shirt.

Lumian's gaze instantly froze.

It was Grisha.

Grisha, Peng Deng's co-renter!
