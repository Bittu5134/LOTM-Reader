## Chapter 86: Another Idea

The pewter-black dirk clattered to the ground, bouncing a few times
before coming to rest.

Lumian heaved a sigh of relief and muttered to himself, *Without the
protection of the half-activated black thorn symbol, this thing's a
ticking time bomb...*

Luckily, he already knew how to avoid the sinister dirk's adverse
effects.

Lumian approached the grayish-white remains and picked up the black robe
left behind by the monstrous 'blacksmith.'

He tore off several strips of cloth and wrapped them tightly around his
right hand, as if applying a thorough bandage.

Then, Lumian grasped the Fate Appropriator Dirk.

The pewter-black dirk remained unresponsive the entire time.

Prepared to discard the item in his hand at any moment, Lumian relaxed
and whispered, "I need to find a scabbard to carry it around safely.

"Do I have to permanently bandage my left or right hand just to have
time to protect myself when I need to draw the blade in an emergency?

"This thing is dangerous, but it's also incredibly powerful. Besides its
short lifespan, it outclasses all the Beyonder weapons Aurore mentioned.
Many Level 3 Sealed Artifacts might not even compare."

While muttering to himself, Lumian swaddled the Fate Appropriator Dirk
in layers of black cloth.

Once wrapped securely in three layers, he slid the evil dirk into his
left belt with a sense of relief.

Having done this, Lumian rubbed his temples and, despite his physical
and mental exhaustion, entered the room from which the 'blacksmith'
monster had emerged. He searched the room meticulously.

Aside from the smoldering furnace, he found nothing.

Lumian's investigation concluded cautiously and carefully as he retraced
his steps.

Unhindered by fate, he successfully left the ruins, crossed the desolate
wasteland, and entered his semi-subterranean two-story building.

Not in a rush to sleep, Lumian left the room, stowed the Fate
Appropriator Dirk, and rested briefly. Once his spirituality recovered
and his needs were met, he performed the bizarre dance---alternating
between madness and distortion---in his bedroom.

He aimed to attract the peculiar creatures in the vicinity and let one
of them possess him to test the negative effects.

Having sensed the fear and reverence of the flaming monster, the
three-faced monster, and the Fate Appropriator Dirk towards the black
thorn symbol, he was no longer as terrified of allowing certain entities
to possess him.

His corruption was far more powerful!

Moreover, he was quite exhausted and would soon fall asleep. When the
time came, even if the strange being he harbored was reluctant to leave
or caused severe negative effects, he would recover after resting in the
real world for a day.

*Is this what Aurore often calls cheating and exploiting loopholes?
*Lumian mused as he danced.

As the dance intensified, his spirituality expanded, merging with a
certain force of nature that radiated in all directions.

Gradually, Lumian, seemingly fused with his surroundings, sensed
something entering the area.

He lifted his leg, took a step, and spun around. Without activating his
Spirit Vision, he saw three translucent figures materialize at the
bedroom's glass window.

They were the familiar skinless monster, shotgun monster, and
mouth-orifice monster.

*Seems like my spiritual perception isn't strong enough, or my level is
too low. I can only 'summon' them... *Lumian didn't mind. He
drew the ritual silver dagger Aurore had given him and sliced a wound on
the back of his left hand.

A drop of crimson blood quickly welled up but didn't spread.

On the spot, it congealed and took on a demonic hue.

The three ghostly figures outside the window instantly stirred.

Lumian deftly used the ritual silver dagger to pick up the congealed
drop of blood. With a final flourish of his dance moves, he pointed the
blade towards the mouth-orifice monster.

He was inviting the entity to latch onto him.

The monster, bearing three black marks on its upper body, opened its
vortex-shaped mouth as if responding to Lumian's call, but it hesitated
to take further action.

*That's right. The window is still closed, and the monsters in the dream
ruins don't dare enter my house...* Lumian swiftly grasped the
situation. In sync with his dance rhythm, he leapt, landing gracefully
on the desk before the window.

With his left hand, he slid the tightly shut glass window open. Then, he
extended the ritual silver dagger, bloodied tip first, outside the
house.

Instead of devouring the drop of blood and entering Lumian's body
through the ritual silver dagger, the maw-like creature retreated seven
or eight meters, floating amidst the howling wind, still mesmerized by
the dance.

"Hey, come over!" Lumian, on the verge of completing his final dance
step, couldn't help but urge anxiously.

The three hazy, translucent figures outside the house drifted further
away. As Lumian's dance came to a halt, they vanished entirely.

"..." Lumian stared at the scene, baffled by the mouth-orifice monster's
refusal to possess him.

He carefully reviewed the dance and the bloodletting process, certain he
had made no mistakes.

*Could it be that its fixation remembers that I killed it, so it's
unwilling to attach itself to me?*

*But the knowledge that came with Dancer didn't mention this. Logically,
it should be more eager to possess me and take revenge...*
Lumian pondered.

Recalling the three-faced monster's flight upon seeing him, he
formulated a new hypothesis.

*I'm corrupted by an evil god and sealed by a greater being. Are these
strange creatures terrified and unwilling to attach themselves to
me?*

This was an extremely rare circumstance. It made sense that Dancer's
corresponding mystical knowledge wouldn't cover such anomalies.

The more Lumian considered it, the more he believed this was the cause,
and the angrier he became.

"So you guys just watch me dance, but aren't willing to possess me?

"What's this called? In Aurore's words, freeloading!"

Lumian's disappointment grew as he realized that, before reaching
Contractee, one of Dancer's abilities was rendered useless. He couldn't
attract strange creatures and exploit their traits or powers.

He consoled himself, hoping that only the dream ruins' creatures behaved
like this. After all, they were closely tied to the owner of the black
thorn symbol.

*I wonder what I can attract in reality. Will they dare to attach
themselves to me...* Lumian mused, walking to his bed and lying
down.

His mood lifted as he glanced at the Fate Appropriator Dirk, ensconced
in layers of black cloth, on the cabinet beside him.

This powerful Beyonder weapon would aid him in delving deeper into the
dream ruins and uncovering their secrets. The only drawback was its
inability to be brought into the real world.

*I wonder if that mysterious lady can help bring it out, just like how
she brought the potion and ritual ingredients into the dream
ruins...*

*But the next time I explore the dream ruins, I'll have to trouble her
to bring the Fate Appropriator Dirk back in...*

*She's definitely unwilling to keep providing help. She's clearly averse
to hassle and prefers slacking off...*

With these thoughts, Lumian drifted into a deep sleep.

†

When Lumian woke up, the sky was an unnatural shade of inky black. Only
a smoldering crimson smear of sunset remained in the distance, filling
him with a bleak melancholy as if the entire world had abandoned him.

Adjusting his emotions, Lumian left the room and descended to the first
floor.

Aurore was busy cooking dinner.

"Are your eyes okay?" Lumian went over to help.

"Pretty much." Aurore tucked a stray lock of blonde hair behind her ear
and widened her eyes at him.

Lumian peered into their light blue depths but saw nothing amiss beyond
a hint of blood.

Aurore continued frying the lamb chops and casually asked, "Discovered
anything interesting in the dream ruins this time?"

Lumian began chopping ingredients for the last dish, recounting his
encounters.

"That blade is powerful indeed." Seeing her brother was unharmed, Aurore
stifled her concern with a laugh. "If it were me, I'd never call it Fate
Appropriator Dirk. Too straightforward, lacking charm."

Lumian asked curiously, "What would you name it then?"

Aurore smiled and said, "Fallen Mercury!"

"Fallen Mercury it is!" Lumian nodded immediately.

He had to use the name his sister gave!

Aurore burst out laughing.

"Actually, it's not the best name, but that's all I could think of on
short notice.

"Hmm, the monsters' behavior confirms our theory. The black thorn symbol
on your chest, or rather, the corruption in your body isn't simple. It
can suppress something powerful to an extent and relates closely to that
hidden existence.

"Perhaps the key to the loop lies with you."

"Yes." Lumian nodded. "Let's see what secrets the dream ruins hold. Then
we'll wait patiently for the twelfth night."

So far, they had investigated almost all abnormalities. Only the tomb
where the owl was had not been explored.

It was far too dangerous. Aurore didn't believe she, Lumian and the
three foreigners could face it. Her only hope was asking Madame Pualis
for help, but she clearly didn't intend to interfere, merely waiting for
the opportune moment.

Lumian didn't hold much hope recounting how the strange creatures his
dance attracted were hindered by the two symbols on his body, preventing
success.

"Grande Soeur, any ideas to circumvent this restriction?"

Aurore scooped up the lamb chops, pondering a moment.

"Since it's impossible to invite a 'god' to possess you, why not try
giving an order?"

"Order?" Lumian's eyes lit up.

Aurore nodded slightly.

"Since those strange creatures fear the corruption in your body and the
seal of that great existence, use their fear like a fox assuming the
authority of a tiger. Order them to attach themselves to you. Right, use
ancient Hermes when you try."

"That's an idea..." Lumian understood what his sister meant by "a fox
assuming the authority of a tiger."
