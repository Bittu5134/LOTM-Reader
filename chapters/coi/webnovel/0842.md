## Chapter 842: Departure

"Omebella..."

Hearing the voice of the Abscessed Hand and the name it shouted, a chill
ran up Lumian's spine, making his hair stand on end and cold sweat break
out.

He didn't know when the Abscessed Hand had regrown bones and flesh from
the ashes, returning to its original form, but he was prepared for any
abnormalities when it passed by him, given the contract stemming from
the Inevitability pathway's powers between them.

Lumian wasn't overly worried; they were "colleagues" now, and the
situation shouldn't turn dangerous. What he didn't expect was that the
Abscessed Hand would call out "Omebella."

It was like a horror story!

For a moment, Lumian couldn't help but wonder if he had already been
subtly eroded by the Great Mother's Child of God, Omebella, to the
extent that he was gradually being replaced.

Standing in the pure darkness, the unseen Abscessed Hand paused for a
few seconds, then continued moving forward with the group of iron
puppets and undead soldiers, marching mechanically.

Only then did Lumian snap back to reality, pondering the reason for what
had just happened.

*According to Ludwig, some beings created directly by the Great Mother
or granted her boon, lacking necessary intelligence, can sense the trace
of Omebella's bloodline in me and regard me as the Great Mother's Child
of God...*

*Hand Bro was first revived and interrupted by divine descent, then
controlled by 0-01, becoming its puppet. The feminine transformation
trend seemed to have stopped, meaning it hasn't fully revived and lost
its self-awareness, truly lacking necessary intelligence.*

*Was it directly created by the Great Mother, or did it receive Her
boon? The corruption turning it into a woman and pushing it to the limit
of beauty likely originated from the Great Mother...*

*That does seem plausible. Even a single drop of blood can regrow a
complete body, evoking a sense of rebirth...*

*But something's off. By this logic, the Abscessed Hand should call me
an Honorable Child of God and show some subservience. Heh heh, to
directly call the Child of God's name is blasphemy!*

Lumian grumbled to himself, growing more puzzled.

*Also, if Omebella itself is a title, the Abscessed Hand should only
know I'm a Child of God, not a specific name. The Great Mother likely
has multiple Children of God, perhaps continuously created. How could
the unwise Hand Bro distinguish who is who and what their name
is...*

*Unless, Omebella is the most special Child of God, or Hand Bro knew
Omebella---the Giant Queen---in its previous life?*

Lumian raised his right hand, rubbing his chin, thinking he should
quickly report this to Madam Magician after leaving and see if they
could uncover the Abscessed Hand's original identity. Perhaps the
ancient records in the New City of Silver contained some clues.

After a few seconds, Lumian vanished from the spot, teleporting back
near the top of the corpse mountain.

Distracted by the Abscessed Hand incident, he remembered he still had
spoils to collect.

That was the Beyonder characteristic of the Demoness of Affliction from
Celeste, which could later be used by Jenna.

As for Julie's characteristic, after the divine descent and filthy blood
incident, Lumian had no idea where it was.

In the deathly silent darkness, Lumian stored the shapeless Demoness of
Affliction Beyonder characteristic in his Traveler's Bag.

He even placed two chunks of Celeste's corpse inside.

*Maybe they can be used as supplementary ingredients. If not, I can give
them to Ludwig. With me as godfather away for so long; I should bring
him a gift. But will he consider this dirty...* Lumian mumbled
and teleported to the edge of the wasteland, leaving the area steeped in
deathly darkness.

As 0-01's proxy, he quickly and smoothly exited the underground
mausoleum, returning to the entrance area.

Lumian then opened his eyes, seeing the blue sky.

At that moment, the morning sun was bright but not harsh, the air fresh
and carrying a slight burnt scent after the rain.

Having spent over ten hours in the eternal darkness of the underground
tomb, Lumian felt as if a lifetime had passed.

Then, he saw numerous heads, each trailing a bloodstained, pale spine,
hovering in the air.

They were countless, thousands, all staring at the entrance of the tomb,
at Lumian.

Among them were faces Lumian recognized, regulars at the Carnivore bar.

*The aftermath of 0-01's activation?*

*There must be thousands, if not tens of thousands...*

*Is this a form of sacrifice?*

*Red Priest...*

Thoughts flashing through his mind, Lumian raised his hands.

His forehead became hot, with a slight prickling pain.

*Ooo!*

A violent gale suddenly blew, scattering the thousands of heads with
trailing spines back into the city.

The flying heads seemed to sense Lumian's will, drifting with the wind,
and landed back on their headless bodies.

*So this is the special power of a proxy? Unfortunately, it can only be
used in Morora...* Lumian lowered his hands, feeling regretful,
and walked out of the cemetery.

At the cemetery gate, an exile was twisting his own returned head back
in place.

*Crack!*

His head turned from facing his spine back to the front.

Seeing Lumian watching him, he smiled and spoke normally, "Today's...
weather... is really nice..."

"Yeah," Lumian responded with a relaxed smile.

He teleported directly to the Carnivore bar, appearing at the door of
Julie's room.

The corpse of Lez was gone from the bed, along with Julie's collections.

*The enforcers have been here... Did they bury Lez's body in the
cemetery?* Lumian mused and vanished from the spot.

This time, he appeared at the door of the Knowledge Cathedral.

He walked inside, up to Heraberg in his plain white robe with brass
threads, and smiling, took out the books he had borrowed from the
Traveler's Bag.

"Archbishop, I've finished them all."

As he spoke, Lumian felt Heraberg looked slightly older.

"Finished them all, really?" Heraberg asked with a smile.

Lumian made a sound and honestly replied, "There are two books I didn't
listen to, but I can't continue anymore."

Heraberg nodded approvingly. "If you know, you know. If you don't know,
you don't know; there's no need to pretend."

As he took the books, he said, "There's indeed no need to read these
anymore. I must remind you, these books are infected with a disease, as
are the other items in your bag. You need to handle them properly, burn
or purify them to prevent the disease from spreading."

"Celeste's Grade 1 Sealed Artifact is so potent? It continues to produce
a Disease even inside the Traveler's Bag..." Lumian said sincerely,
"I'll be careful. Thank you, Archbishop. Archbishop, how do I seal an
object that spreads a deadly disease?"

Heraberg looked at Lumian for a few seconds, then laughed.

He pointed to another brass bookshelf. "That one, that one, and that
one, take a look and learn."

*Indeed, teachers never give direct answers...* Lumian didn't
resist continuing his studies. He pulled out the books and placed them
in his Traveler's Bag.

Then he smiled and asked, "Your Grace, what should I do to leave
Morora?"

The white-haired Heraberg said meaningfully, "No one has ever forbidden
the residents here from leaving Morora, they simply don't want to
leave."

Lumian was momentarily stunned, then asked with sudden realization,
"Leave the way you came?"

Heraberg showed a look of approval, then pointed to Lumian's clothes.
"Do you want a change of clothes?"

Lumian looked down and saw his clothes, pants, and shoes had become
tattered from the previous intense battle.

He was about to take out spare clothes from the Traveler's Bag but
remembered they were also infected with the mystical disease.

Heraberg pointed to a room near the stairs.

"There are clothes you can change into."

"Thank you, Your Grace." Lumian sighed in relief and quickly entered the
room, finding several plain white robes with brass threads hanging
inside.

These were the vestments of the Church of Knowledge clergy.

Lumian glanced back thoughtfully at Heraberg, who had resumed reading,
and swiftly changed into a robe that fit his size.

He then opened the cathedral's heavy, ajar wooden door and descended the
stone steps layer by layer, deep into the underground.

The passageway hadn't changed since he came; the glowing gems embedded
in the walls still provided some illumination.

That indescribable terrifying sound echoed in Lumian's ears again.

Lumian walked at a steady pace towards the exit. As 0-01's proxy, the
more he walked, the more he felt this might indeed be a long esophagus.

*What kind of creature would have such an esophagus?* Lumian
pondered but couldn't find an answer.

Alert to this possibility, he neither transformed into a flaming spear
nor teleported, instead walking obediently for several hours until he
reached the double bronze doors.

He extended his hands and pulled, making the door emit a heavy sound as
it slowly opened.

Outside, no one was guarding it.

Lumian sneered silently and stepped out.

He didn't forget to close the door behind him.

Wearing the plain white robe with brass threads, he walked back, feeling
unseen, unknown gazes upon him.

Reaching the prison where he had been held, Lumian activated the black
mark on his right shoulder.

He chose to teleport back to Trier, to the apartment he rented.

His body and spirit were in decent shape, but he felt a strong sense of
fatigue, wanting to rest.

Just as his figure materialized, he saw Ludwig enjoying afternoon tea.

Ludwig looked up and froze.

*Clang!*

The silver fork in the boy's hand fell onto the dessert plate.
