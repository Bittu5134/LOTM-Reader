## Chapter 202: Analysis

"Of course," came Susie's gentle voice, reaching Lumian's ears.

Almost simultaneously, Lumian felt a weight pulling at his
consciousness, dragging him down swiftly into deeper depths.

Within a matter of seconds, his eyelids grew heavy, and he could not
resist the urge to close them. His thoughts became muddled and
indistinct.

In his dazed state, Lumian appeared to transform into a spectral figure,
floating through the familiar village of Cordu in the cloak of night.

After an unknown duration, he caught sight of the onion-shaped
cathedral, though his perception remained hazy. A concentrated beam of
light emerged near its main entrance, while the rest of the darkness
loomed like an ominous shadow.

Lumian meandered aimlessly toward the adjacent cemetery.

In the darkness, tombstones stood in silent formation, and trees assumed
an eerie presence.

A group of men were hauling a lifeless body toward a deep pit, preparing
to cast it down.

Beneath the faint glow of the crimson moon, one of the men lifted his
head and surveyed his surroundings.

His face, with black hair and piercing blue eyes, bore deep creases, as
if shrouded in shadows.

*Pons Bénet!*

Lumian snapped out of his reverie.

The distance between them diminished instantly. Lumian lowered his gaze
and beheld the corpse.

The face of the lifeless body appeared swollen from water, drained of
color. The brown hair clung damply to the head, while the brown eyes
remained wide open, reflecting agony, indignation, and resentment.

*Reimund!*

A surge of intense hatred filled Lumian's heart as he hurled accusations
at Pons Bénet and his companions, giving vent to his emotions.

It felt as if he had unleashed a torrent of curses, as if he had pounced
on Pons Bénet, the villain. It felt as if he was digging a profound pit
with his bare hands.

Dirt pierced his nails, uncovering another corpse at the pit's bottom.

The girl's eyes, a shade of lake-blue, bulged fiercely. Her face bore a
bluish-purple hue, her mouth agape, and her neck showed evident signs of
strangulation. She wore an expression of excruciating pain.

*Ava!*

Lumian shot up from his seat, propelled by intense emotions, and his
eyes flew open.

*Huff. Puff.* Lumian stared at the vacant sofa opposite him in
the booth, gasping heavily.

The intense anger and hatred from his dream lingered, causing him to
tremble uncontrollably.

After a few moments, Susie's gentle voice broke the silence. "What did
you see?" she asked.

Lumian's face twisted slightly as he replied, his voice filled with
pain.

"I saw them. I saw Reimund and Ava's bodies. One of them drowned, and
the other appeared to have been strangled to death... Pons Bénet and his
gang were burying their bodies in the cemetery next to the cathedral...
I shouted at them, wanted to do something... and then I woke up."

Susie listened attentively and spoke calmly.

"This time, I didn't allow you to have a lucid dream. Instead, I let you
experience certain subconscious scenes in the form of a dream.

"While it may not present the complete truth, it combines fragments of
what actually happened. There might be overlaps in time or space, but
the essential details remain intact. It provides us with a basis for
interpretation."

Lumian asked, his voice filled with anguish, "So you're saying that I
really witnessed Pons Bénet and the others burying Reimund and Ava's
bodies in the cemetery?"

"I'm not entirely certain," Susie analyzed. "What we can conclude so far
is that Reimund was drowned by Pons Bénet and his companions, and Ava
was strangled to death by them. Their bodies were eventually buried
somewhere in the cemetery, and you may or may not have been present at
the scene. It's possible that you discovered it later and attempted to
unearth their corpses as well as seek revenge on Pons Bénet and his
gang, but the outcome wasn't favorable. Otherwise, your recent dream
would have reflected some of that content."

Lumian fell silent for a moment before speaking again.

"So that's what happened... I was wondering why Pons Bénet and the
others didn't kill me and toss me into the deep pit if I was truly
there..."

Part of his anguish stemmed from a fear deep within him---a suspicion
that he might have been in league with Pons and his gang.

"We cannot dismiss the possibility that you were present at the scene
and witnessed the entire incident, but there are numerous explanations.
It may not be as you imagine it to be. They spared your life because
they needed a vessel with exceptional physical attributes." Susie
understood Lumian's doubts and resistance. Her words aimed to soothe him
gently. "What I can affirm is that the anger, hatred, and desire for
revenge you experienced in your dream were genuine. Those were your true
emotions at that time. In other words, regardless of the circumstances,
the deaths of Ava and Reimund have nothing to do with you."

Upon hearing Susie's words, Lumian felt as if a weight had been lifted
off his shoulders. He slumped against the sofa, his strength draining
away.

His mind was now much calmer than before, and he no longer needed to
maintain a facade of bravery.

In the blink of an eye, an invisible warm breeze swept through his body
and mind, soothing him completely.

Susie's encouraging voice filled the air, her smile evident.

"Compared to our last session, you're in a much better state now. You
showed courage sooner than I anticipated, facing the doubts and
questions you were reluctant to confront.

"In the realm of psychology, this is a crucial indication that you're
breaking free from the puzzle. Only by directly confronting the problem
can you find a resolution.

"Alright, that concludes today's treatment. You're ready to face Louis
Lund, Madame Pualis, and the others."

In that very instant, the composed Lumian pondered the words of Madam
Magician, recalling her earnest advice.

"There is yet another matter.

"I may be compelled to believe in another entity at some point, but
ordinarily, I am forbidden to recollect His honorific name. Do
you---either of you---possess a means to prevent such recollection?"

The cheerful female voice responded, her words carrying a gentle smile,
"That is quite simple. I shall provide you with a psychological trigger.
When your spiritual intuition feels devoid of protection, your
subconscious will replace the honorific name with 'That Being' to
safeguard against its impact.

"While under protection, you may freely remember and speak His name in
its entirety..."

Lumian's mind turned adrift briefly upon hearing the other person
declare, "The psychological cue has been planted."

"Thank you, Madam. And thank you too, Madam Susie," Lumian nodded toward
the empty space across from the booth.

"You're welcome. See you in two weeks," the gentle female voice replied,
and Susie added, "See you in two weeks."

Lumian wasn't sure when they departed, but the area around Booth D grew
still. Only the chirping of birds in the botanical garden, the clopping
of hooves on the road, and the distant hum of machinery resonated.

He lifted his cup, finishing the remainder of his Intis coffee in one
gulp, adjusting his mental state.

Seizing the moment, he replayed the entire treatment process in his
mind, and an inexplicable feeling settled upon him. Madam Susie's last
statement seemed somewhat peculiar.

*She said I can face Louis Lund, Madame Pualis, and the others now...
Does that imply that the answers I might receive from Madame Pualis
could shatter me?*

*It's understandable, but what if my condition doesn't improve as
expected? Will she advise me to give up the opportunity to meet Louis
Lund? But what if Louis Lund emerged yesterday? Wouldn't it be a major
problem if I hadn't had my follow up?*

*If that's the case, shouldn't Madam Susie have warned me against
approaching Madame Pualis or confronting the padre before the follow-up
session?*

*How can she be so certain that I won't encounter Louis Lund in the past
two weeks, or that he'll elude capture if I do?*

*Spectator...*

Lumian's senses snapped back to full alertness. He exited Booth D and
hailed a public carriage back to Le Marché du Quartier du Gentleman.

Lumian didn't rush to send a messenger to Auberge du Coq Doré or the
safe house on Rue des Blouses Blanches to inform Madam Magician about
Termiboros. Instead, he made his way straight to 126 Avenue du Marché to
check if his subordinates, Anthony Reid, or Franca had discovered
anything.

With a dark brown wide-brimmed hat atop his head, Lumian strolled to a
spot diagonally across from "Black Scorpion" Roger's house, roughly 20
meters away. He settled into a gap between two buildings, leaning
against the wall.

Several vagrants occupied the area.

One of them shuffled closer to Lumian and whispered, "Nothing yet."

Lumian nodded and directed his gaze toward the three-story building with
a garden, keeping an eye on passersby.

As time ticked by, the sun descended on the horizon, casting a dwindling
light. The lamplighters commenced their task, igniting the gas lamps one
by one.

At that moment, Lumian spotted a man clad in a grayish-blue worker's
uniform.

Underneath his cap, light-yellow hair peeked out, and his slightly
chubby face exuded an air of simplicity and honesty.

*Anthony Reid? Why is he out and about?* Lumian recognized the
information broker, perplexed by his actions.

Resembling a worker finishing his shift, Anthony Reid hurried toward the
end of Avenue du Marché.

Lumian's pupils contracted when he realized that Anthony Reid wasn't
merely passing by; he was approaching someone.

The man sported a blue gown adorned with yellow buttons, a waxed hat, a
white tie, and a red vest. He sat inside a rental carriage bearing a
yellow plate, clearly a driver affiliated with the Imperial Carriage
Company. Carriage drivers from different companies donned distinct
uniforms.

The carriage driver tipped his hat, keeping his head lowered as if
waiting for a customer.

Lumian's heart stirred. He rose to his feet, taking a few steps in that
direction.

As Anthony Reid brushed past the carriage, he stumbled and collided with
the horse pulling it.

Startled, the horse attempted to raise its forelegs, but the carriage
driver swiftly tugged on the reins, firmly restraining the animal.

Yet, as the carriage driver lifted his head, his face was revealed.

In his forties, with black hair, Lumian couldn't discern his features
clearly due to the distance. Nonetheless, a faint sense of familiarity
washed over him.

Lumian narrowed his eyes as he profusely apologized to Anthony Reid and
left the carriage behind. A valet emerged from 126 Avenue du Marché.

Approaching the carriage, the valet addressed the driver,

"My master wishes to hire your carriage. Proceed inside and assist with
moving some items."

The carriage driver nodded, replying in a deep voice, "Okay."

Following the valet, he entered the residence belonging to "Black
Scorpion" Roger.

Lumian, who had witnessed the entire sequence of events without catching
their conversation, smirked.

He was now utterly certain that the carriage driver was Louis Lund!

*At long last, you've arrived!*
