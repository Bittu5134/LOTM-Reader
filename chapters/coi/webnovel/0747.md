## Chapter 747: Pact Experience

*Ding-ding.*

The object resembling a steam train whizzed past Lumian, its presence
nearly obscured by the thick, dark mist. Yet, Lumian managed to discern
some details: both carriages were blue and seemed to be crammed with
passengers standing and facing the street, their expressions blurred and
their forms lacking clear outlines.

*This is more than what I had witnessed in Fourth Epoch Trier---it isn't
powered by steam.* As these thoughts flashed through his mind,
Lumian noticed someone at the other end of the street, hunched over,
pulling a black, two-wheeled cart with a canopy.

A lady sitting in the cart, holding a round fan and dressed in a long
skirt, was hidden by the thick mist, which obscured the finer details of
her and the puller's attire.

Lumian found himself staring as the black cart approached.

At that moment, the lady in the cart lifted her fan to her face, turned
slowly, and looked back at Lumian.

As if the mist had thinned, Lumian could see the back of the lady's hand
holding the fan: swollen and shiny with dark, bluish patches.

The puller, with a towel around his neck, stopped, and the lady, who
seemed about to step down from the peculiar cart, looked towards Lumian.

A wave of fear washed over him, instinctively repelling any contact with
the lady.

Then, he heard a panicked whisper---it was his own voice, although he
harbored no such thoughts!

Standing on the edge of the street, enveloped in the dark mist, Lumian
felt a sharp tension as if his true self wasn't entirely present.

Lumian's heart tightened as he attempted to step back.

He suddenly found himself floating up, soaring into midair.

He saw the core of the dense mist, a vast city with a bizarre, shadowy
high tower beneath which lay unspeakable horrors and gloom.

Unwillingly, he flew towards it.

Almost at the same time, he saw specks of starlight appear.

Lumian abruptly exited his Cogitative state; the city and tower wrapped
in the dark mist, the segmented train, and the lady with the floral fan
vanished from his "vision."

He opened his eyes to see Madam Magician and Mr. Hanged Man.

"You were a bit off just now, showing signs of losing control, so I had
to wake you," Madam Magician briefly explained.

Lumian thanked her, extinguished the enticingly fragrant corpse wax
candle, and detailed the scenes and characters he had witnessed during
his meditation.

Madam Magician nodded thoughtfully and remarked, "It's similar to a
pact-making ritual.

"This has established a connection between you and some unknown entity,
progressively aligning with it. However, unlike a true pact ritual that
is directed towards deities, angels, demons, or evil spirits, your pact
seems to be with a city.

"If I hadn't interrupted the process earlier, you might have accessed
some higher knowledge or power through this pact experience, though it
likely wouldn't have been something positive."

Lumian, no novice in mysticism, understood the nature and implications
of such rituals. He pondered and then countered, "So, you're saying that
the city in the fog, closely related to Fourth Epoch Trier and very
special, has formed a connection with me through this corpse wax candle,
despite the vast distances and the layers of seals between us?"

"Yes, it's not an illusion," Madam Magician replied, looking towards the
candle encased in a small glass vial with a light yellow and red hue.
"Besides the corpse oils of the Iron-blooded Knight and Demoness of
Despair, this candle likely contains some special materials to which its
origins I'm not aware of. There are two other locations where it could
be more effective, allowing you to see and experience more. But those
are far too dangerous; you already showed signs of losing control, so I
wouldn't recommend trying it now."

"The other two locations..." Lumian's curiosity piqued. "Is one of them
Fourth Epoch Trier?"

In Fourth Epoch Trier, he could already partially see that misty city.
Lighting the candle and entering a Cogitative state would surely reveal
much more sights and experiences!

"Yes," Madam Magician affirmed Lumian's guess.

"And where is the other place?" Lumian inquired further.

Unless the School of Truth's vortex project could unlock Fourth Epoch
Trier's seals, it would be a long time before he could re-enter that
version of Trier.

Madam Magician eyed Lumian for a few seconds before simply stating,
"Bansy."

*Bansy... Bansy Harbor? The harbor that had been destroyed by the Church
of Storms due to some corruption, where no one had escaped? That was
also the former home of Red Angel Medici...* Lumian nodded
almost imperceptibly.

Considering the Red Angel's gains in Fourth Epoch Trier and the pathways
He took, Lumian had no doubts about the special nature of Bansy Harbor
being akin to that of Fourth Epoch Trier.

"Of course, it must be a specific place in Bansy Harbor, not just
anywhere," Madam Magician added, then continued, "There's another place
I'm not sure about for the candle's efficacy."

"Which place?" Lumian asked, then had a sudden insight, "City of Exiles,
Morora?"

"Correct, you're now clearly seeing the connections between things,"
Madam Magician praised him, sternly advising, "If you do decide to
venture to those places and use the corpse wax candle to aid your
Cogitation and complete the pact, make sure someone is with you at all
times to monitor your condition and wake you immediately if anything
unusual occurs."

"I'll remember that," Lumian promised earnestly.

As Madam Magician gestured for Lumian to pack away the candle, she
thought for a moment and said, "Use the Sword of Courage as a Sealed
Artifact for now. When it's time to concoct the Iron-blooded Knight
potion, I'll revert it into a Beyonder characteristic.

"By the way, the Sealed Artifact crafted by Hisoka's Beyonder
characteristics should be completed in a few days."

"Thank you, Madam Magician," Lumian expressed his gratitude sincerely.

Although obtaining the Iron-blooded Knight main ingredient so easily
felt somewhat unreal, when he thought about how the Blood Emperor's
residual aura came to be, which played a key role in it, and the issue
of the Underworld Daoist's seal, he realized it wasn't that "easy" after
all.

Lumian then discussed the remains of Omebella's umbilical cord and
Ludwig's three processing methods, finally asking, "Can I consume that
piece of umbilical cord to gain some of the Great Mother's Child of
God's bloodline?"

Madam Magician's expression turned slightly strange as she looked
towards The Hanged Man Alger, seemingly seeking his opinion on the
matter.

The Hanged Man looked at Lumian and asked seriously, "This will indeed
bring you some opportunities, but with them, corresponding risks as
well. We can help you, but we can't be there every moment. You need to
consider whether you're willing to take this risk and if it's worth it."

Madam Magician added, "While the Great Mother's attention might sound
nebulous and not tangible enough to have a real effect---after all,
you're already under the scrutiny of the being known as
Inevitability---having one more such entity's attention might not seem
like a big deal. However, remember, the Great Mother's interference and
permeation in our world far exceed those of the Inevitability entity. If
you do consume Omebella's umbilical cord remnants, you might face
unknown influences or attract special enemies without even realizing it.

"Of course, there's only a potential risk, not a certainty."

What concerned Lumian more was another point.

"Madam Magician, Mr. Hanged Man, it seems you've already confirmed that
consuming Omebella's umbilical cord will bring some opportunities?"

This must be a significantly useful opportunity; otherwise, Madam
Magician's expression wouldn't have become strange, nor would she have
consulted Mr. Hanged Man.

There's no need to hesitate on matters with only downsides; it's the
presence of significant potential benefits that causes Madam Magician to
pause!

Madam Magician weighed her words carefully before responding, "The
vortex project might involve a location tainted by the Great Mother's
power, teeming with monsters spawned from this corruption. If you
possess the bloodline of the Great Mother's Child of God, theoretically,
you wouldn't need to worry about attacks from them, and you might even
be able to command them simply.

"That's one aspect. Another is that once you meet two other prerequisite
conditions, you should be able to touch and briefly use a Grade 0 Sealed
Artifact."

*Grade 0 Sealed Artifact... Extremely Dangerous. Not to be inquired,
disseminated, described, or spied; capable of destroying a country or
even the whole world...* Lumian's spirit lifted at the mention.

So far, he had indirectly encountered two Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts: 0-01
and 0-05.

"What's the number of that Grade 0 Sealed Artifact?" Lumian curiously
asked. "Why would having the Great Mother's Child of God bloodline allow
me to touch and briefly use it?"

Madam Magician glanced at Lumian and said, "I can't tell you the details
yet. All I can say is, it's not the Child of God bloodline of the Great
Mother that allows you to touch it, but rather the integration of
Omebella's umbilical cord remnants with you that helps you access it
without facing severe danger, because it originated from Omebella's
remains."

*Omebella's remains... Omebella had remains before being born? No,
that's normal, as there are already remnants of the umbilical cord
before She was born... Ah, the one that shares the same name? No,
obviously, it's more than just sharing names...* Lumian pondered
and then asked, "Are you referring to the remnants of the Goddess of
Harvest from ancient times?"
