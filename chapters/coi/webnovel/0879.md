## Chapter 879: Demoness of Despair

In the next two to three minutes, a large number of exiles poured into
the square in front of the Knowledge Cathedral. Some, accidentally
bumped into, chose to duel on the spot. Others quietly straightened
their necks so they wouldn't be too crooked. Some sang loudly out of
boredom, while others played a game of slapping each other...

Lumian stood on the steps, holding the Beyonder characteristic of the
Demoness of Despair, expressionless as he watched these exiled felons.

*Time is running out...* Lumian silently whispered to himself,
turning to look at the Knowledge Cathedral once more, but still did not
see Archbishop Heraberg of Morora.

Finally resigned, he turned his gaze back to the exiles, who almost
filled the square.

There were definitely more than thirty thousand.

Lumian suddenly started laughing, his body trembling with mirth.

Though he seemed to have many choices, considering environmental
factors, time constraints, the current situation, and his own
obsessions, only one path remained.

The only road before him.

After laughing for over ten seconds, Lumian, dressed in a white shirt,
black vest, dark trousers, and laced shoes, stepped down from the steps
and walked into the crowd.

The exiles near the Knowledge Cathedral began to feel something was
wrong. Their bodies weakened, and when they tried to slap their
opponents, it felt more like caressing their faces.

Some instinctively wanted to flee but found their legs powerless, their
bodies heavy, moving only slowly.

*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.* White-blue fireballs shot out from
around Lumian, flying over the exiles infected with mystical diseases
and landing at the edges of the square, which the exiles strangely
ignored.

*Rumble!*

The fireballs exploded simultaneously, surrounding the square in a hell
of white flames. The temperature soared, and thick smoke billowed.

*Thud, thud, thud.* Countless exiles, whose conditions had
worsened, fell to the ground, watching as other felons with some
strength left trampled over them. They stared at the white flames
lighting up the sky, inching closer to them.

Pain and despair quickly filled their hearts, consuming their sanity.

Some wanted to call for help but could only make weak sounds.

*Rumble!*

Amid continuous explosions, Lumian walked out of the square, into the
spreading sea of flames, and into the nearest street.

*Rumble!*

The houses on both sides of the street either collapsed under the
white-blue fireballs or were directly ignited, rising into fierce flames
like torches.

The felons in the square fell one by one, feeling helpless against the
disease, experiencing pain and despair, waiting for death.

Lumian took out a glass bottle, placing the Beyonder characteristic of
the Demoness of Despair, Plague Mother Serpent's bile, fragments of a
Silver Hunter, blood of various plague victims, and fresh mistletoe into
it one by one.

Bubbles gurgled up, and the dark purple potion shimmered with a rosy
light.

Lumian gazed at the potion, laughing hoarsely. "Don't worry, I already
know my insignificance. I will embrace despair and the path of the
Demoness.

"But this is to avoid being manipulated in the future, to choose my own
ending!"

With that, he walked forward, raising the bottle to his lips and tilting
his head back to drink.

The exiles still standing in the square suddenly felt their pain and
despair condense into something tangible, turning into invisible threads
extending toward the burning street, toward the figure with his back to
them.

They finally "awoke," but were too sick to fight the perpetrator. Some
were even already engulfed by flames, burning their bodies.

They saw the figure walking step by step among the burning buildings,
walking through the hellish streets, under the bright red sky. His hair
floated up, growing longer, blacker, and thicker.

In the air, two stars seemed to light up, and the white-blue flames in
the area suddenly turned pitch black.

This blackness spread like a flood, quickly drowning all light, making
the fiery hell quiet, deep, and dark.

†

In the special mirror world, in the dark scene of the abandoned park
where Franca and others fought against Higdon of the Order of All
Extinction.

Covered in greenish-yellow mucus, Higdon had split into four, each
seeking different targets, while black flames of the Demoness burned
quietly around Franca and Jenna.

The black flames burned the spirituality of the disease but were dimmed
by the decaying power, eventually extinguishing.

If it weren't for discovering that Higdon's disease, having some
spirituality, could be ignited by the Demoness's black flames to slow
its spread and intensity, Franca believed she and Jenna would have
already exhausted their Mirror Substitutes and awaited death.

Meanwhile, the Pride Armor played a crucial role, almost unaffected by
Higdon's diseases, and not corroded by the decaying power. It remained
energetic, chasing down Higdon whenever he dared to attack from behind,
occasionally unleashing a Hurricane of Light.

During the battle, Franca and Jenna noticed another problem.

They couldn't tell if it was because Higdon had no brain or if the
demigod was just unlucky, but his Certain Death attacks often missed.

Combined, the two Demonesses and Anthony, who used his Psychological
Invisibility to stay out of the decaying range, barely managed to hold
on for nearly nine minutes before Higdon---a demigod. Occasionally, they
even felt that Higdon lacked the oppressive presence of a true demigod,
seeming like a poor-quality product.

But even so, they couldn't find an opportunity to escape and discovered
that their enemies were multiplying---from two at the start to four now,
with one splitting off to find Ludwig.

Moreover, although individual Higdon fragments seemed weaker than a true
demigod, each fragment retained the same level of power, making them
collectively terrifying. Franca guessed the number of splits should have
a limit, but not too many.

*I have two Mirror Substitutes left. Jenna probably has one... Anthony,
although attacked less and outside the range, only had two to begin with
and has used one...* Franca analyzed the situation quickly while
constantly repositioning to avoid Higdon's sudden Sure Hit attacks.

As for Lugano, when Higdon blocked him at the start, Franca signaled him
to run as far as he could and hide.

It proved to be the right call. Higdon's targets were Ludwig and the two
Demonesses, making no effort to stop Lugano from fleeing and not
splitting more Higdons to chase him.

*Continuous use of black flames is also draining our spirituality. Jenna
and I can't hold on much longer...* Franca considered whether to
use the last Mirror Traversal of the Ice Amulet now to delay for a while
and see if there would be a turning point.

It could also give Anthony a chance to survive.

The Hypnotist was also not Higdon's target and had Psychological
Invisibility.

Just as Franca was about to signal Jenna to approach, she suddenly saw
greenish-yellow drops forming behind Jenna, quickly condensing into
Higdon.

Almost simultaneously, Franca noticed from Jenna's worried expression
that something was happening behind her too.

Without hesitation, both Demonesses activated Mirror Substitution.

The next second, two Higdons spread out like dirty, slimy "blankets,"
wrapping Franca and Jenna in a Sure Hit.

A cracking sound followed.

Meanwhile, Anthony, quietly lurking at the edge of the park, leaning
against a half-wall, suddenly saw a greenish-yellow mucus-covered Higdon
appear beside him.

He had been discovered after all.

Higdon pushed with both hands, sending a greenish-black light ball
towards Anthony.

*Crack!*

Anthony used his last Mirror Substitution, his figure appearing behind
this Higdon.

Seeing this, Anthony had an epiphany.

*An opportunity!*

He didn't flee but raised his Winter is Coming revolver, aimed at
Higdon, and pulled the trigger.

Certain Death!

A yellowish bullet, tinged with dim green, crossed the short distance,
hitting Higdon.

Covered in greenish-yellow mucus, Higdon froze, his body quickly
disintegrating into small drops, falling to the ground without any
spirituality.

This Higdon was dead.

But the other three Higdons remained unaffected.

After confirming this, Franca and Jenna felt utter despair.

Their previous plan involved the two Demonesses as bait, giving Anthony
a chance to shoot one Higdon with the Certain Death bullet, hoping to
kill all Higdons.

Unexpectedly, the Certain Death effect only worked on the one hit.

Moments later, they saw the Pride Armor hit by a Certain Death attack,
metal fragments falling from its chest, standing still.

Jenna gritted her teeth, ready to forgo the ritual and gamble on
forcibly advancing by consuming the ingredients of the Demoness of
Affliction.

At least it would restore her spirituality.

Even if she failed, she could turn into a monster, giving Franca a
chance to escape.

Before Jenna could reach into her Traveler's Bag, another figure
appeared at the edge of the area.

It was Voisin Sanson, with his blond hair turning white, who had chased
them here!

Jenna and Franca's hearts sank rapidly. Jenna no longer hesitated.

At this moment, above one of the Higdons, a black iron sword, burning
with white-blue flames, suddenly fell from the sky, accurately piercing
the top of this Higdon's head.

*Boom!*

This Higdon exploded into fragments, the spreading white-blue flames
turning into silent blackness, engulfing each piece.

The fragments never reappeared, and a figure quickly appeared in the
eyes of Franca, Jenna, and Anthony.
