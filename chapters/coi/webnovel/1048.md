## Chapter 1048: Information Revealed by 007

After sending the meeting request through the skull-headed messenger,
Franca turned on the wireless telegraph transceiver and small analyzer
machine.

*Click-clack*, messages were typed onto paper by the mechanical
typewriter one after another.

Franca read for a while before joining the group chat.

"I'm the group's early sleep assistant. Those members who haven't gone
to rest yet must pay a fine---only gold accepted!"

As she sent out the telegraph, she recalled life in the dream city.

Group chatting over long distances in the real world is so difficult!
Franca felt inexplicably melancholic and nostalgic, suddenly losing the
desire to show off her honorific name.

*What about Sequence 3? Even Sequence 3 can't solve the problem of
real-time long-distance group chat!*

*If we ultimately survive the apocalypse, I hope the God of Steam and
Machinery---no, the God of Electric Power and Information Technology
will bring about a new industrial revolution.*

*I am a Demoness of Unaging, I can wait!*

Moon King was the first to reply to Franca: "Look at my
nickname---obviously the type who's only active late at night!

"By the way, Hidden Blade, you haven't been online for almost a month.
What kind of mission doesn't even leave you time in the evenings?"

"Look at you, not even knowing that secret missions require turning off
phones and cutting off all contact with the outside world. You clearly
haven't dealt with such things before. 007, am I right?" Franca
suspected Moon King was joking with her, but had no proof.

007 replied: "I was also locked away for a while."

Franca immediately perked up. "You... advanced to Sequence 4?"

"Yes, I got the qualification." 007 didn't hide it.

The other group members exploded:

"A demigod?"

"The first Saint among us!"

"Besides Hela and Gandalf, this is the Research Society's third demigod,
right?"

"007, didn't you say that even with the qualifications, you'd have to
queue and wait for a long time?"

After the rapidly spitting paper slowed down, 007 explained: "I also
thought I'd have to wait longer, but recently, the Church not only
brought out many stored Sequence 4 and Sequence 3 Beyonder
characteristics, but also crushed some Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts. Most
candidates who currently qualify and meet all prerequisites have been
scheduled for advancement, though some failed.

"This situation makes me suspect major events will occur within the next
year or two, which is why the Church is mass 'producing' demigods
regardless of consequences and costs."

*This matches the speculation about the apocalypse coming early---the
Eternal Blazing Sun Church thinks so too?* Franca noticed the
other group members suddenly fell silent, clearly also thinking about
the major crisis, wondering if they would be affected and whether they
could handle it.

Franca could tell that 007 probably knew part of why the Eternal Blazing
Sun Church was doing this, given that he was now a Saint, but he
couldn't say directly and could only hint at it.

"Did you become an Unshadowed?" Franca changed the subject.

She actually didn't want 007 to continue advancing on the Sun pathway,
feeling that the Unshadowed were too pure, and being within the Church,
would inevitably become fanatical. If so, the 007 who would complain
about her always finding things to keep him too busy to rest might never
speak such words again.

This gave Franca the feeling of watching a friend gradually slip away
before her eyes.

However, she had never tried to persuade 007, only pointing out the
possible changes that becoming an Unshadowed might bring, letting 007
make his own decision with full knowledge.

Everyone's life should be their own to control---she had always believed
this.

She was also grateful that when she was hesitating between becoming a
War Bishop or advancing to Demoness of Unaging; Lumian and Jenna only
presented options without trying to persuade her. Although they probably
had their own thoughts and preferences, they never showed them, never
manipulated, never pressured. Judge actions, not thoughts---that was
very, very good, since everyone inevitably had dark and selfish
thoughts, but ultimately not acting on them showed they'd overcome
themselves, proving they're not that kind of person.

An Unshadowed might not have dark, selfish thoughts, but I actually hope
007 does... Franca silently sighed.

007 quickly replied to her: "Yes."

Staring at this word on the telegraph paper, Franca let out a long sigh.
"Ah..."

007 continued: "Some colleagues have switched to other pathways, and
some colleagues not in neighboring pathways have also gained
advancement."

At this point, Franca quickly adjusted her mindset.

She kept telling herself, *007 just deliberately hinted and reminded
everyone to prepare for major events and disasters, showing he still
retains his positive emotions and humanity!*

*As people age, everyone changes and becomes somewhat different from
before. 007 has just changed a bit more, but in terms of friendship,
he's still that same 007.*

"What major events will happen in the next year or two?" Another
telegraph group member Wind Sound pressed.

"I'm not sure," 007 answered concisely.

"Stop asking, stop asking." Franca forcefully inserted herself into the
conversation to prevent 007 from being put in a difficult position.
"What we can do is take opportunities to improve ourselves and enjoy
life in the meantime."

"Hidden Blade, you seem to know something?" Moon King telegraphed.

Franca wasn't bound by secrecy restrictions, but she didn't dare speak
too clearly, fearing some group members might become too desperate and
turn to extremes.

After careful consideration, she said: "If I tell you that the
apocalypse is approaching, but there's hope of surviving if tall figures
shield us and everyone is prepared, would you believe me?"

The previously constant incoming telegraphs suddenly stopped.

After a long while, 007 replied: "I believe you."

"Dammit, I'm panicking."

"Great Lord Hidden Blade, introduce me to a Demoness, I'm going all in!"

"Damn, I hope it won't be a case of dying before spending all my money."

"I need to buy land and dig a bunker..."

With 007's endorsement, Wind Sound and others truly believed Franca's
words.

Those who could join this telegraph group were either laid-back,
good-natured, or decent people. Although they were all quite nervous and
worried at the moment, they could still express their inner emotions in
rather lively and playful language, with no one particularly depressed
or desperate.

Seeing her initial purpose achieved, Franca seized the opportunity to
say: "I've actually become a demigod too."

"...Now I really believe something big is going to happen."

"Good heavens, Hidden Blade has become a demigod?"

"Still a Demoness, or did you switch to the Hunter pathway?"

"..."

The group members immediately burst into chatter.

Don't you know how to chat! Franca snorted and responded: "Still a
Demoness."

"Demoness of Despair?" 007 suddenly inquired.

*What does 007 mean? Right, he's already an Unshadowed, a church
higher-up, and while Demonesses mainly operate in Intis and the Southern
Continent, even if he doesn't know the exact Despair potion formula, he
must know the corresponding advancement ritual to detect anomalies and
stamp out plague outbreaks early...* Franca replied with
understanding: "Don't worry, I didn't harm any innocent people, and I
used a shortcut method."

"Shortcut? Rituals can have shortcuts?" Moon King's words revealed
surprise.

Wind Sound sighed: "Hidden Blade, how can you advance so quickly, are
you even human anymore? Oh right, not human, half-god half-human..."

Franca considered carefully before saying: "Actually, we transmigrators
all possess certain special qualities. When conditions are met and the
pathway is suitable, these qualities manifest, helping us make
tremendous progress at certain stages.

"In a sense, we are chosen ones."

Chosen by the Celestial Worthy!

Afraid the group members would become arrogant, she quickly added: "This
isn't entirely a good thing."

"What special qualities?" 007, Moon King, and others telegraphed almost
simultaneously.

Franca chuckled and typed quickly: "Can't say, if you know, you know.
You'll know when you encounter it."

Not giving the group members a chance to ask follow-up questions, she
quickly changed the subject: "007, are you still in Trier?"

Now that he was an Unshadowed, an archbishop or senior deacon, he would
need to guard a diocese, and the Eternal Blazing Sun Church had
sufficient forces in Trier, even with Angels hidden there.

"Still in Trier," 007 replied. "Many of the Saints who advanced this
time have stayed in Trier as mobile forces."

*Many stayed in Trier?* Franca suddenly became alert.

*Does the Eternal Blazing Sun Church think Trier is where problems are
most likely to erupt?*

Franca couldn't help but lower her head to look at the floor.

What she was really looking at was the Fourth Epoch Trier and the
special mirror world sealed beneath Trier.

Will the apocalypse's outbreak start from beneath Trier rather than the
high-altitude barrier? Franca slightly furrowed her brows as this
thought flashed through her mind.

At this moment, Madame Hela's silver skull-headed messenger returned,
letting a paper held between its teeth float down before her.

Franca caught and read it: "Tomorrow morning at ten, Rue Ancienne,
Little Dairy Cow Café."

†

Quartier de l'Observatoire, Rue Ancienne.

Franca, who only dared go out after using Lie to lower her looks and
suppress her charm, arrived at the Little Dairy Cow Café fifteen minutes
early.

She sat by the window, watching with interest as people came and went
outside, as bicycles, bionic mechanical devices, and steam robots
hurried past.

Soon after, Hela, dressed as a black widow, appeared at the door.

The moment she saw this lady, Franca suddenly had a strange feeling that
she walked between darkness and sunlight, death and life.

Hela's complexion had grown slightly paler, the sense of being alive
seemingly fainter.

*Has Madame Hela advanced again? Indeed, if the Eternal Blazing Sun
Church is mass-producing demigods, how could the Evernight Goddess
Church not do the same? She switched back to the Death pathway, Sequence
3 Ferryman? Wonder what special abilities come from combining the
Darkness and Death pathways...* Franca now had very rich
mystical knowledge.

"Good morning." She stood up, smiling in greeting.

After Hela replied, she said to the café waiter, "A glass of absinthe,
and a triple espresso shot."

After they both sat down, Franca fiddled with the veiled hat placed
beside her and said with a smile,

"I went to a place recently with skyscrapers, electric cars, mobile
phones, and the Internet. Unfortunately, it was just a dream."

Madame Hela listened carefully before nodding slightly. "I know you went
there."

"Uh..." Franca was stunned.
