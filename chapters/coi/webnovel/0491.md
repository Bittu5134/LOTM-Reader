## Chapter 491: Unexpected "Helper"

The gray fog encircling Fourth Epoch Trier extended into the wilderness,
as if intercepting and obstructing an unseen force.

In the midst of the tempest, Snarner, Diest, and the other formidable
beings felt a high and formidable aura. An instinctive urge to bow in
submission washed over them. It was as if the Blood Emperor Alista
Tudor, who had met His end deep in Fourth Epoch Trier, had returned from
the abyss. However, He wasn't as unhinged or violent as before. Instead,
a veiled sense of danger and calamity lingered.

Fighting the impulse to surrender while stepping back, Their eyes
fixated on the figure of a young man clad in blood-stained black armor,
adorned with long red hair and a conspicuous red mark between his brows.

Their nerves tensed as a name echoed in their minds:

*Medici!*

*Red Angel Medici!*

He was a king from ancient times. As early as the Fourth Epoch, or even
during the catastrophic demise of the Third Epoch, he held the title of
King of Angels.

Kings of Angels were Archangels beyond Sequence 1, yet They hadn't
attained the level of a Sequence 0 true god. Through the consumption of
multiple Sequence 1 potions or the possession of the key to deity
status, However, having something missing prevented Them from taking
that crucial step.

The Red Angel was among the eight Kings of Angels who had once served
the Ancient Sun God. Though He met his end at the hands of Alista Tudor
during the Fourth Epoch, leading to the latter's ascent as Blood
Emperor, the King of Angels hadn't completely perished. Transformed into
an evil spirit in a hidden sanctuary, He survived and reemerged a few
years ago, resuming His activities.

As Angels of the Hunter pathway, Snarner and Diest grew increasingly
apprehensive about the situation. They suspected that Medici might have
already acquired a Conqueror Beyonder characteristic, ascending once
again to a Sequence 1 Archangel.

While devising a plan to obtain Vermonda Sauron's Conqueror Beyonder
characteristic, Snarner and Diest remained cautious of the possible
involvement of the ancient king. When Albus Medici disclosed his name,
Their vigilance heightened, and They kept a constant watch on him. Only
when the operation was unexpectedly hastened, and the Red Angel showed
no signs of breaching the seal, nor did Albus Medici display any
abnormal behavior, did they finally ease up.

But just at that critical juncture, Red Angel Medici appeared!

With a terror-inducing aura that subjugated everything, He soared
majestically from the depths of Fourth Epoch Trier. Seizing the
opportunity, he dealt a severe blow to Vermonda Sauron with a single
strike.

Medici's disdainful gaze swept across Snarner and Diest as He casually
tossed an item to the struggling Calamity Giant, Vermonda Sauron.

It was a blood-stained umbilical cord.

The moment the umbilical cord left Medici's hand, it burst into flames,
emitting a golden light resembling a miniature sun.

Above surface Trier, the sun, engulfed by hurricanes, lightning, and
torrential rain, suddenly emitted a blinding light, tearing through the
calamitous scene.

A chubby baby, seemingly crafted from pure sunlight, soared out of the
tear, transforming into a golden sun hurtling towards Red Swan Castle in
Quartier Éraste.

The scorching sun tore through the sky, liquefying the spires, walls,
and floor of the ancient castle. It plunged into the depths of the
underground maze and into the bronze coffin.

Wherever it passed, darkness dissipated, and the withered hearts turned
to ashes. Elros Einhorn, stationed outside the underground palace,
instinctively shut her eyes, her body trembling uncontrollably.

High in the sky, The Hanged Man didn't pursue the self-destructing sun.
Instead, he hovered above the storm, his gaze fixed on Red Swan Castle,
which bore a massive wound. It remained unknown what he contemplated.

Danitz, leading his team in Quartier Éraste's battle against the mutated
soldiers and the monstrous Carbonari army, couldn't help but curse under
the intense sunlight.

The people around him and the mutants shared a similar reaction.

In the outer seal of Fourth Epoch Trier, an invisible flame burning
silently in the sky formed a massive vortex, tainted with a golden hue.

The sun descended from the vortex, illuminating the entire wilderness
and Fourth Epoch Trier as if it were daytime.

It caught up to the burning umbilical cord and enveloped the severely
injured Archangel, Vermonda Sauron.

Sunlight erupted, and darkness vanished. The Calamity Giant, formed by a
Conqueror's loss of control, emitted a tragic cry and swiftly
dissipated, undergoing profound purification.

The infant that had transformed into a sun ceased to exist. Only the
remnants of its power burned fiercely, emitting light and warmth.

Snarner, Diest, and the other powerhouses turned sideways, steeling
themselves to withstand the impact of the sunlight.

†

In the brilliantly lit Fourth Epoch Trier,

Voisin Sanson and Madame Pualis, entangled in intense combat,
simultaneously closed their eyes, as if unaccustomed to the direct
sunlight.

Upon reopening their eyes, they found themselves separated, no longer
able to see each other. One stood in a square adorned with stone
pillars, while the other perched on a collapsed black building.

"Wh..." The two bestowed, who had already tasted the power of godhood,
were momentarily taken aback before realizing that Fourth Epoch Trier
had undergone a transformation due to the impact of the golden sunlight,
leading to a shift in direction and spatial disarray.

†

Gardner Martin, donned in a full-body silver armor, could already
discern the dense grayish-white fog ahead, resembling an impenetrable
wall. A surge of joy coursed through him.

What he desired, what he sought, was within reach.

Suddenly, sunlight pierced through, illuminating the nocturnal
environment.

Instinctively, Gardner Martin shut his eyes and decelerated.

Then, a cracking sound reverberated.

It emanated from his neck.

In surprise, Gardner Martin lowered his head, acclimating to the
sunlight.

Accompanied by an intense and peculiar pain, he witnessed the widening
gap between his head and chest. Blood spurted from the stump of his
neck, staining the area crimson.

He also beheld his white, bloody spine.

*How could this be...* This thought flashed through Gardner
Martin's mind, a mix of shock and fear.

He had always believed himself to be the favored one, the special one.
Hence, under the watchful eyes of the great will deep within Fourth
Epoch Trier, even upon entering 13 Avenue du Marché, he assumed he would
only suffer minor corruption. He could wield a certain power from Fourth
Epoch Trier to a limited extent without transforming into a terrifying
monster like Olson, whose head and body had been severed.

Yet now, his head had detached from his body, dragging along his spine.
Just as he was on the verge of approaching the great will!

†

Lady Moon, adorned with brown wings and bird-like claws, crumpled amidst
cascading silver lightning.

Initially, she descended into madness, morphing into a bewildered
monster. This marked the onset of the Plague Storm from the Spectator
pathway, succeeded by Magician's nine attacks from nine directions.

As sunlight bathed the scene, Magician instinctively closed her eyes.
With a sweep of her right hand, the void contorted, shaping into a
sealed dark sphere that encased her, Justice, and the swiftly fading
Lady Moon. Together, they withstood the ensuing anomalies as a unified
entity.

†

Within the sphere woven from thick black hair, Jenna, Franca, and
Anthony felt the tumultuous storm and various catastrophes outside,
causing the ground to quake and the sphere to sway.

In an instant, time slowed, and the snake-like black hair composing the
dark sphere swiftly split open, revealing a beam of sunlight above.

In the sunlight, Jenna and Franca seemed to discern an ethereal female
voice.

"Reconcile with your mirror self..."

With these words, the snake-like black hair disintegrated entirely, no
longer coalescing into a sphere. It retreated into the void.

Franca and the others found themselves surrounded by a layer of dark
glass, silently shattering and falling under the sunlight.

The lights and figures in the nearby buildings vanished, and Jenna and
the others returned to the dead silence reminiscent of when they first
entered the ruins.

After adjusting to the sunlight, Anthony immediately looked at Lumian
and noticed that the blood vessels on his companion's face had faded.
His contorted expression gradually eased.

"Are you alright?" Anthony inquired, employing Placate.

Upon hearing the roars, Lumian's mind was filled by the man's sighs in
the dark room. The overwhelming knowledge that gripped him in corruption
had subsided. He no longer felt like his head was about to burst or lose
his rationality.

He quickly returned to normal, no longer hearing the sigh or seeing the
withered man in strange attire.

"I survived," Lumian replied to Anthony's question.

Simultaneously, he thought, *Is that the Celestial Master the Armored
Shadow mentioned?*

*Using the Eye of Truth here is even more dangerous than the outside
world.*

Franca gathered the items, picked up Flog and other belongings, and
threw out the Arrow of the Bloodthirsty.

"What happened to you just now?"

"The aftereffects of using the Eye of Truth." Lumian took the Arrow of
the Bloodthirsty and stabbed it into his chest. Surveying the area, he
said, "Let's quickly collect our items and relocate."

Previously, he had used Flog, hoping to attract the attention of
dangerous entities, thereby creating chaos to find an opportunity. Now
that Mirror Gardner had been dealt with, it was crucial to move to avoid
new threats.

Jenna, with no time to ponder the meaning of reconciling with her mirror
self, placed the bone flute, wooden box, and other items in the
blood-stained cloak. Following Lumian, Franca, and Anthony, she sprinted
in a random direction around the black pillar.

†

Beneath the blistering sunlight, the purple flames constituting Vermonda
Sauron's flesh and blood flickered out one by one. The anguished faces
representing the diverse Sauron family members disappeared sequentially.

The Red Angel's form abruptly expanded, resembling a diminutive mountain
peak.

Brandishing a broadsword condensed from purple flames, He advanced with
a step and swung it at the dying Vermonda Sauron.

Having regained their composure, Snarner, Diest, and the other
formidable beings were not inclined to yield. They acted in unison,
intervening to impede Him.
