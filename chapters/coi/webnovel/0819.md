## Chapter 819: Subteam Operation

In the evening, in Trier, at 35 Rue Saint-Nornez in Quartier 20, known
for its public cemetery.

In different states of invisibility, Franca, Jenna, and Anthony stood
outside Room 6 on the fifth floor, checking the details of the
environment and making final preparations for their operation.

According to the information provided by Periodic Table, Nikila, a
suspected member of the Moses Ascetic Order and possibly a Mirror
Person, was an ordinary employee of a grain company, living a very
regular life, leaving home punctually every day and returning on time.

The only unusual thing about Nikila was that, despite being in his
mid-thirties, he was still unmarried, citing severe intermittent
migraines as the reason why women found him unappealing.

When Franca read this information, she immediately thought, *This
matches the characteristic of Mystery Pryers continuously influenced by
the evil god, Hidden Sage... Could it be that Mirror People of the
Mystery Pryer pathway are also infused with knowledge by the Hidden
Sage?*

Recalling the content of the dossier, Franca emerged from her
invisibility state and created a layer of frost, making it seep into the
keyhole and freeze solid.

As a result, she produced a crystalline key and easily opened Nikila's
door.

Taking advantage of the fact that this ordinary employee hadn't yet
returned home from work, Franca took out a mirror and began divination
to avoid any traps or warning setups that might be in the apartment.

"Bedroom, living room, and guest room all have full-length mirrors, and
there are up to fifteen or sixteen portable mirrors. If you're not a
Mirror Person, who would believe that?" Franca mumbled to herself,
checking the room twice.

She was also conveying the collected information to Jenna and Anthony
outside the door.

Of course, there was another possibility for so many mirrors, which was
that Nikila was a Demoness. However, it was obvious that this individual
was not an exceptionally attractive female, nor even a female at all.

Franca went to the full-length mirror in the living room, looked at
Jenna and Anthony's figures in the hallway, and said, "I'll ambush
behind this mirror. Follow the plan to force the target into this
mirror. If he can use the mirror world, we can confirm he's the Mirror
Person, Griffith."

As she spoke, black flames quietly burned around the room, erasing
traces left by the previous search.

Jenna nodded slightly and specifically reminded, "Be careful of an
ambush behind the mirror, like the one Lumian encountered before."

"Don't worry. Magic Mirror Divination told me there's no ambush. Of
course, I won't fully trust and rely on divination. I'll stay vigilant."
Franca felt Jenna's concern, smiling as she took out the Seven-Stone
Bracelet from the Traveler's Bag, now with only two diamonds left, and
tossed it outside.

As she threw it, she couldn't help but mutter in her heart, *Out with
the old, in with the new, out with the old, in with the new...*

Once Jenna caught the Seven-Stone Bracelet, Franca reiterated, "After
confirming Nikila enters this mirror, you both immediately teleport
away, using that fixed entrance to the mirror world to assist me."

"No problem," Anthony replied, wearing gloves, closing the apartment
door, and warming the lock area, which had become icy from the cold key.

This was to prevent Nikila from sensing the residual cold and suspecting
anything amiss when he opened the door.

Once Jenna and Anthony left, Franca took out the Ice Amulet, hanging it
around her neck.

Then she placed her palm against the full-length mirror in the living
room.

With a flash of cold light, she silently passed through the glass.

Behind the mirror was void, a spider-web-like deep dark tunnel filled
Franca's vision.

Keeping a close watch on the surroundings, Franca breathed a sigh of
relief and murmured, *No ambush.*

Confirming this, she leaned closer to the mirror, peering through the
glass into the apartment's living room:

Nikila had not yet returned, and outside, the dusk was eerily quiet.

Franca's nerves instinctively tightened. She raised her right hand,
rubbed her temples, and sighed.

*It would be great if Lumian were here...*

This operation was proposed and perfected by her, killing many of her
brain cells and making her responsible for achieving the goal without
severely harming Jenna and Anthony. She couldn't relax at all.

In the past, Lumian bore these burdens and responsibilities. She only
needed to question and use her imagination to complete her part of the
task.

*Sigh, being a team leader is exhausting, no chance to slack
off...* Franca composed herself and patiently waited.

In the café diagonally across from 35 Rue Saint-Nornez.

Jenna, now a girl in a black dress with her hood removed, sat by the
window, chatting with Anthony about various Trier anecdotes.

Suddenly, she propped her left elbow on the table, using her palm to
press down her original flaxen hair, her voice dropping slightly. "The
target is back."

Anthony, while acting attracted to the beautiful woman opposite, glanced
with his peripheral vision at the apartment building.

A double-decker public carriage had stopped by the roadside, and a man
in his thirties wearing a black wool coat and a half-high silk top hat
got off.

The man was nearly six feet tall, walked steadily, had a thin face with
distinct features, and rare deep black eyes.

*It's definitely Nikila...* Anthony nodded slightly to Jenna,
confirming she hadn't mistaken the target.

Jenna then straightened her head, withdrew her left hand, and glanced at
the cuckoo clock on the café wall.

She smiled lightly at Anthony and said, "Three minutes to go."

She meant that in three minutes, the operation would officially start.

The reason for waiting three more minutes in the café was to avoid
Nikila's instinctual investigation as a Mystery Pryer after returning
home.

This was a detail discussed and decided by Franca, Jenna, and Anthony.

†

Nikila, wearing a half-high silk top hat, walked step by step up to the
fifth floor and stopped outside Room 6.

He didn't open the door immediately but raised his right hand and rubbed
his temples.

Then he closed his eyes briefly and reopened them, his pupils now a deep
purple with a mysterious aura.

Eye of Mystery Prying!

Usually, Nikila used special Warlock spells to weaken the effect of the
Eye of Mystery Prying to avoid sudden death, but it couldn't be
completely sealed. Now, he was using it to its full potential to observe
the surroundings inside and outside the room.

Bugs on the ceiling, hairs in the cracks, the neighbor cooking in front
of the coal stove, dust floating in the air, children running up and
down the stairs, rats hiding in the shadows, pedestrians passing by on
the streets---all these scenes overlapped in Nikila's deep purple eyes.

At the same time, he saw shadowy curtains around him and dark aqueous
light on the surfaces of all mirrors.

Before the gaze behind the shadowy curtain could become more pronounced,
Nikila ended his observation abruptly, closing his eyes.

He knew if he continued looking, something unpredictable might happen,
filling him with fear.

*Phew... The Eye of Mystery Prying is truly dangerous. Listeners on the
Secrets Suppliant pathway hear things, we see things, and both are
equally likely to encounter the forbidden and die
mysteriously...* Nikila muttered, pulling out a brown leather
scroll from an inner pocket of his black wool coat, softly chanting a
word in Hermes---"Myopia."

The scroll immediately ignited with black flames, quickly turning to
ash.

The mysterious deep purple in Nikila's eyes faded into the black depths
of his pupils.

After doing this, Nikila took out his key and opened the door.

He had confirmed there were no suspicious individuals or enemies hiding
in the shadows, nor were there any signs of abnormalities around the
apartment or the street.

Entering the living room, closing the door behind him, Nikila unbuttoned
the top of his wool coat and white shirt, relaxing on the sofa with his
arms stretched out.

Franca, watching from behind the full-length mirror, took advantage of
Nikila's forward movement to grab a beer from the coffee table,
extending her right hand slightly through the mirror, pressing it
tightly against the glass.

When Nikila sat back on the sofa, Franca immediately withdrew her hand.

Gulping beer, Nikila read the newspapers he had brought back, behaving
like any ordinary employee.

Time passed slowly, and as three minutes elapsed, Jenna and Anthony left
the café, turning into a nearby secluded alley, preparing both their
shadow hiding and Psychological Invisibility techniques.

They quickly returned to the target apartment and hid in their
prearranged positions.

At this time, Nikila was still reading the newspapers, considering
whether to go out for dinner or cook something simple.

Suddenly, Nikila's throat felt dry and itchy, as if he hadn't drunk
water for a long time.

He coughed once and thought, *I drank half a bottle of beer, why is my
throat so dry?*

As this thought crossed his mind, he couldn't help but cough again.

Immediately, a strong sense of unease washed over him.

*Something's wrong!*

Just as Nikila became alert, Jenna, hearing two consecutive coughs from
the target through the wall, emerged from the shadows without
hesitation. With her hood still on, she inserted the Arrow of the
Bloodthirsty into her own heart.

Her flaxen hair seemed to lengthen slightly, her contours became more
refined, and her facial features more stunning.

Previously, Jenna's beauty highlighted her feminine charm, an expression
of femininity. Now, her beauty seemed to become a more independent
concept, alluring by sheer virtue of its existence.

Through the door, she made the shadows beneath Nikila's feet and the
surrounding darkness coalesce into illusory yet solid black chains,
wrapping around the target.
