## Chapter 964: A Bit Special

Across from the building where Peng Deng worked.

Jenna walked up to the gray sedan and watched as the door opened and
Ludwig got out by himself.

She nodded to Anthony in the driver's seat, then led Ludwig towards a
nearby café.

Based on Peng Deng's occupation, they had already formulated a plan for
making contact:

If they had money, they could buy a house, then go to the design company
where Peng Deng worked for a consultation, using abilities like Hypnosis
or Instigation to "designate" Peng Deng as their designer.

Then, they could discuss design ideas, concepts and styles with Peng
Deng, and sign a contract, allowing them to repeatedly contact the
target through follow-up activities like reviewing plans and visiting
sites, gradually becoming familiar, and ultimately figuring out if he
had any issues and what those issues were.

But unfortunately, they didn't have that much money.

If they really had money to buy a house, wouldn't it be simpler and more
convenient to just rent the magic mirror Arrodes and ask it for detailed
information about Peng Deng?

So Anthony only planned to execute the first half of the
plan---fabricating the fact that he owned a house, using home renovation
as an excuse to go for a consultation, using his Hypnosis ability to get
the company boss to assign Peng Deng to talk to him, and finally leaving
with the excuse of needing to think it over, without signing a contract.

If Anthony's operation failed, encountering a situation where Peng Deng
was unavailable or happened to be meeting a client, and he was assigned
to a different designer, then Jenna would execute the second plan.

After entering the café with Ludwig, choosing a window seat, and
ordering a cappuccino, a fruit juice, a small cake and a bunch of bread,
Jenna looked at the little boy across from her and fell into deep
thought, *Every time we need to carry out a probing mission, we have to
switch who takes him along. It feels so troublesome...*

*He can certainly be very useful, but a child's appearance, mentality
and cognition mean he can't act independently, and we're not comfortable
with that... not comfortable with the ordinary people of the dream
city...*

*Should we find a way to get him into some elementary school, so he can
attend classes? That way, we wouldn't have to worry about him during the
day, just pick him up when it's time.*

In Jenna's silence, Ludwig suddenly had a bit of a bad premonition. At
that moment, the small cake was brought over, and he immediately smiled,
picking up the fork and spoon.

Jenna thought for a while, but still gave up on the idea of sending
Ludwig to elementary school.

That wasn't like going to cram school, which only took an hour and a
half with breaks in between and parents waiting outside. He'd have to
stay at school all day, and unless they gave Ludwig the Traveler's Bag,
there was really no way for him to carry enough food.

*What would happen then, a classmate every two periods?*

Meanwhile, Anthony saw Peng Deng enter the building.

After 9 o'clock, confirming that Peng Deng hadn't left, he got out of
the car, entered the building, took the elevator, and arrived at the
design company called "Shengwei".

Anthony said to the receptionist, "I called earlier to inquire and made
an appointment."

The receptionist checked the record book and led Anthony to a meeting
room.

Soon after, the person in charge of the design company came over and
chatted with Anthony for a bit, confirming the style he wanted.

During this process, Anthony deliberately mentioned Peng Deng, saying he
had seen this designer's works and actual results on the company's
public account and felt they matched his ideas well.

Undoubtedly, while saying this, Anthony looked into the eyes of the
person in charge, using Hypnosis lightly. Earlier during the phone
communication, he had also used psychological methods for guidance,
though he couldn't directly apply Hypnosis then.

"Please wait here, I'll go get the designer," the person in charge stood
up and left the meeting room, while a staff member poured Anthony a
glass of water and put out some fruit.

About ten minutes later, Anthony saw Peng Deng appear at the door.

Peng Deng had black hair and brown eyes, with an ordinary appearance.
His hair was styled with some parts fluffed up, and he wore a black
T-shirt with a trendy brand feel, carrying a laptop.

Anthony stood up calmly, not showing any unusual behavior.

After the company manager's introduction, Anthony began chatting with
Peng Deng, mainly describing his needs while Peng Deng listened and
occasionally asked more in-depth questions to understand the details.

After Anthony finished speaking, Peng Deng operated a laptop and
projector, saying, "I found a few images earlier, see if they match the
feeling you want."

Soon, Anthony saw an image: a modern-style living room, bright and clean
with golden sunlight shining through the windows, a vase placed in just
the right position with a bouquet of fresh flowers, and two oil
paintings hanging on either side, depicting sparse, beautiful forests
and lush green fields...

Anthony suddenly felt this was exactly what he wanted.

Peng Deng continued to show several more images, with styles similar to
the previous one, and each seemed to perfectly match Anthony's
requirements.

*He accurately grasped the vision I had in mind just based on the
description over the phone and our face-to-face conversation? Isn't this
a bit special?* Anthony didn't immediately express his thoughts,
but continued discussing with Peng Deng how these images could be
combined into a whole and the specific costs for the designer's fee.

After chatting for a while longer, Anthony stood up and said, "I'll
think about it some more."

"Alright." Peng Deng didn't try hard to persuade him, and escorted
Anthony to the company entrance.

Anthony went downstairs, crossed the street, and passed by the café
where Jenna and Ludwig were.

When the two parties met through the glass window, Anthony nodded
slightly.

Then, he walked straight towards the rented gray sedan.

Jenna withdrew her gaze and continued watching Ludwig eat.

According to their prior agreement, she easily understood without
needing to guess what Anthony's nod just now meant: *I've met Peng Deng
and made contact. Now, I need to self-isolate until dawn tomorrow to see
if any abnormalities occur.*

Tech Building, Intis Group, Administration Department.

After being busy for a while, Luo Shan started to slack off.

She picked up her phone and sent a message to True Hidden Blade: "Do I
need to go hint at Zhou Mingrui about his own specialness?"

Franca, sitting in the workstation diagonally in front of Luo Shan,
hesitated for a while before replying: "Not for now. Wait until my
companion and I can no longer act, then you can do it."

Franca was worried that if Luo Shan hinted too deeply, she would also
encounter abnormalities. While she and her companions might be kicked
out of the dream, dream characters might just die suddenly, or get hit
and run over by a bus after work.

She preferred Luo Shan to only act as her assistant for now, cooperating
with her to hint at Zhou Mingrui.

Luo Shan was about to say something more when Deputy Director Zhang Qing
came out of his office, clapped his hands and said, "Mr. Huang will be
coming over shortly, bringing that VIP from last time to continue
touring the company..."

A rustling sound suddenly arose as many employees took out their makeup
bags and makeup mirrors.

*That VIP from last time?* Franca used her phone to ask Luo
Shan: "Is it Zaratulstra?"

"It should be, he's the only VIP recently, involved in the integration
and merger of certain subsidiaries, as well as a big deal," Luo Shan
replied quickly. "What should we do next?"

She meant, should they let Zaratulstra come into contact with Zhou
Mingrui?

*Didn't Lumian report Zaratulstra yesterday? The police station has no
evidence and can't restrict the foreign guest's freedom for now?
Zaratulstra just went to see Zhou Mingrui at the cram school yesterday,
and now he's coming to the company again today. What does he want to do?
Ah, Lumian was right, passively dealing with things can easily lead to
problems. It's better to actively eliminate hidden dangers...*
Franca looked at her phone, her thoughts racing quickly.

After nearly a minute, she replied to Luo Shan: "Stay calm; let me see
the specific situation before deciding. You just need to cooperate with
me.

"Don't worry, with so many people in the company watching, Zaratulstra
can't do anything."

If worse comes to worst, I'll risk losing my job and pour a glass of
water on Zaratulstra's or Mr. Huang's crotch!

Seeing that Luo Fu didn't take out mirrors or put on makeup, several
nearby employees withdrew their observing gazes, feeling relieved and
focusing on themselves.

Soon after, the group chat reported Mr. Huang's itinerary: "Mr. Huang
has brought the VIP to the 16th floor!"

Tech Building, 16th floor.

Huang Tao, dressed casually, sat down with the formally dressed
Zaratulstra in a room filled with various classical objects and opened a
bottle of Aurmir red wine.

"You said you bought a very peculiar mirror?" Huang Tao continued their
previous topic.

Zaratulstra smiled and said, "Yes, it possesses a kind of magic. It can
let us see our inner selves."

As he spoke, the old man's deep blue, almost black eyes moved slightly,
and he took out a small mirror with a classical design, luxurious style,
and inlaid with gems from his suit pocket.

At this time, his and Huang Tao's entourage had all been left outside
the current room, with only a few security personnel guarding at the
door, not approaching them.

"Look, this is how I appear in the mirror," Zaratulstra placed the
mirror in front of his face.

Huang Tao leaned in and saw that the reflection in the mirror was not
the elderly Zaratulstra, but a man in his thirties with deep black hair
and ordinary features.

*Could it be a high-tech mirror with artificial intelligence?*
Huang Tao mumbled based on his experience and understanding.

"Would you like to try?" Zaratulstra asked him.

"Sure." Huang Tao took the mirror with interest, quietly checking if the
item had any hidden switches and what material the mirror surface was
made of.

He didn't find any issues, so he brought the mirror up to his face with
curiosity.

He then saw himself in the mirror.

It was completely different from what he had imagined.

The him in the mirror was a woman, wearing an ornate golden crown, with
slightly curly chestnut hair, blue eyes, a high nose bridge, thin lips,
and an alluring appearance with an indescribable charm.

Huang Tao was stunned, as if he had seen the anima in his heart.

Lumian, who started his middle shift today, only needed to arrive at the
company before 4:30 p.m.

Since late last night, he had been using the mirror world to sneak into
a hospital called "Crimson Moon", where Li Keji was currently being
held.
