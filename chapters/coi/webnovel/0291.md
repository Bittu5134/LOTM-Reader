## Chapter 291: Important Figure

Lumian set his glass down and flashed a smile, speaking in Intisian but
with the accent of the Riston Province.

"I arrived in Trier just two days ago. Came to Lavigne in search of
work."

Thanks to Aurore's help, he could speak like a local from Trier,
shedding his Riston Province Dariège accent. Having spent six years in
Cordu, he had a knack for learning, imitating, and adapting to new
dialects effortlessly.

The tired bartender looked around as if he hadn't slept well and spoke
cautiously, "That's the famous Blazing Danitz, a significant figure at
sea!"

"I've never heard of him," Lumian replied bluntly.

The bartender cleared his throat, reminding Lumian to watch his tone and
attitude.

"Have you heard about the six Pirate Kings and nine Pirate Admirals?"

"A little," Lumian honestly admitted.

His knowledge about the Pirate Kings and Pirate Admirals came from
newspapers and adventure novels, and he was aware of Gehrman Sparrow
hunting down a few. He knew that the great adventurer's servant, Dubois,
had once served as a pirate on Vice Admiral Iceberg's ship. He knew of
Ailment Maiden or Vice Admiral Ailment, and the frequent change of
Pirate Admirals. As for the Pirate Kings, they were well-established and
had held their positions for so long that no one could remember when
they first came to power.

Realizing Lumian wasn't completely ignorant, the bartender breathed a
sigh of relief.

"That individual used to be a pirate, acknowledged to be stronger than
all the Pirate Admirals, second only to the six Pirate Kings."

*Quite impressive...* Lumian couldn't determine the exact
Sequences of the Pirate Admirals and Pirate Kings, but their survival
despite constant pursuit by the authorities showed they weren't weak.

Blazing Danitz ranked seventh among the pirates, almost reaching the
level of a quasi-Pirate King. He was undeniably formidable!

*A Saint? If he's one, the same can be said for the Pirate Kings... The
strongest among Sequence 5s?* Lumian quickly grasped the
bartender's words.

"Used to be?"

"Yes, used to be. He's no longer a pirate or a Treasure Hunter. Look,
there's no wanted poster of him on the wall." The bartender gestured
around.

*But there's my wanted poster... Thankfully, the bounty is low. It's
tucked away in a corner where no one pays attention...* Lumian
asked curiously, "He can just stop being a pirate because he wants to?
Did the authorities cooperate and revoke his wanted poster?"

*Which country or orthodox Church did he surrender to?*

The bartender lowered his voice even further.

"He's now a member of the Church of The Fool, the envoy of that deity."

*Mr. Fool's Oracle? Perhaps that one and only Oracle?* Lumian
was taken aback.

The bartender assumed Lumian wasn't familiar with the Church of The
Fool, so he explained, "That's a deity recognized by all orthodox
Churches. Heh heh, why would a deity choose such a name?

"The Fool's faith is very popular at sea. Many sea merchants and sailors
believe in Him. They even pooled money to build The Fool cathedral in
Lavigny."

"The cathedral's bishop is that Oracle?" Lumian deliberately lowered his
voice.

"No." The bartender shook his head. "But Blazing Danitz often comes to
Trier. He likes it here. Yes, he's from Intis. There isn't an Intisian
who doesn't long for Trier."

Just as Lumian was about to say something, the important figure at sea,
the Oracle of The Fool's Church, Blazing Danitz, finished his remaining
wheat beer and stood up, heading towards Sea Breeze's entrance.

Almost simultaneously, the sailors---playing cards, drinking, boasting,
and making out with street girls---stood up in an unusually orderly
fashion.

They didn't cause any commotion as they silently and orderly followed
Blazing Danitz out of the bar.

If he hadn't witnessed this scene, Lumian wouldn't have realized that
all the sailors in the bar were subordinates of The Fool's Oracle.

*Blazing Danitz... From his nickname, he deals with fire... Could he
also be from the Hunter pathway?* Lumian sipped his Lanti Proof
and chatted with the bartender about the Church of The Fool.

"What kind of deity is The Fool?"

The bartender gestured a Triangular Sacred Emblem on his chest and shook
his head.

"I'm not a follower, so how would I know?"

"By steam!" Lumian drew a Triangular Sacred Emblem on his chest as well.

The bartender glanced at the empty area and said, "But the Church of The
Fool isn't bad. Even if you're just a tramp, even if you don't believe
in The Fool, you can still receive communion after entering their
cathedral.

"If you ask them for help, you might even get a meal with meat and bread
and a room to sleep in."

"Should I join the queue now?" Lumian asked with a smile.

The bartender shook his head again.

"No need. They can't leave the cathedral to preach or proselytize. Only
the local tramps know they can seek help there, but they only go once in
a while because the Church of The Fool is more willing to offer job
opportunities to them."

After a pleasant chat and having figured out the schedule of The Fool's
cathedral's bishop sermons, Lumian finished his Lanti Proof and decided
to make the most of the spare time by exploring the nearby streets in
detail.

He soon noticed that several strategic points were guarded by the
military, armed with cannons and massive firearms that required
water-cooling.

*The government's distrust of these sailors and merchants, who
occasionally indulge in piracy around the docks, is evident...*
Lumian turned away and hurried towards The Fool's cathedral before
darkness fell.

The cathedral had a simple layout, devoid of gold embellishments or
intricate machinery. The most remarkable aspect was its numerous
windows, allowing natural light to illuminate the interior without the
need for candles and gas lamps even before nightfall.

Like many religious spaces, the walls were adorned with giant murals,
although the colors were muted and somber.

Using the fading light of dusk, Lumian examined the mural's contents and
discovered that it depicted a wilderness where humans struggled to
navigate.

These humans were unusually tall, almost resembling legendary giants.
Some had three eyes, while others lacked noses, leaving only two dark
holes. They looked more like monsters than ordinary people.

Despite the pain and despair evident on their faces, their eyes
shimmered with hope.

Leading these peculiar humans were several distinct and detailed guides.
Some had gray hair and carried two swords on their backs. Others wielded
dark-blue sledgehammers emitting a sun-like glow. There were also
figures clad in dark black armor with silver-gray curly hair...

At the forefront of these guides stood a figure.

Dressed in a black trench coat and a half top hat, the figure walked
with a straight back, holding a lantern.

Just ahead of the figure was a ball of light---the altar of The Fool's
cathedral---a silver-white Sacred Emblem emitting a radiant glow under
the sunlight.

Lumian's attention was drawn to a few stained glass panes. Sculpted in
an exaggerated style, angels and saints adorned them. Some were also
featured in the murals, while others were not. There were angels with
wings and halos, and saints with only halos.

Lumian carefully circled the area, observing for over half an hour.
Eventually, he found a seat and settled in to wait for the 6 p.m.
sermon.

As time passed, many people entered the cathedral. Some were dressed as
merchants, others as typical sailors. There were also dockworkers,
visibly exhausted after a long day's work, and a few street girls as
well.

Amidst the tolling of the bell, the bishop arrived at the altar.

His hair and eyes shone with a golden hue. Towering at 2.56 meters tall,
he donned a finely tailored black trench coat and a half top hat, hardly
resembling a typical clergyman.

With a hearty gesture, the boorish bishop pressed his hand to his chest
and called out in a booming voice, "Praise The Fool!"

"Praise The Fool!" echoed the gathered believers, and Lumian
enthusiastically joined in.

Flipping through the black-and-silver-patterned bible in his hand, the
bishop spoke with a voice that reverberated through the cathedral,

"Our lord is known as The Fool. Across past, present, and future, he
reigns supreme over the spirit world. He is also the King of Yellow and
Black who wields good luck. A beacon for all in the pursuit of
eternity...

"He is compassionate, benevolent, and the savior of this world. He
allows us to address him as him instead of Him...

"Our lord resides above both reality and the spirit world. His
benevolence extends to Heaven and the land. Beside him stand eight
angels...

"The Angel of Mercury is the embodiment of fate, our Lord's most
cherished angel. The Angel of Death has followed our Lord for the
longest period of time and is the consul of the Underworld. The Angel of
Redemption is our Lord's bugle, once taking on the form of Gehrman
Sparrow to deliver his revelations. The Angel of Life is the
crystallization of wisdom itself, the indestructible spirituality that
resides in everyone's body."

*Gehrman Sparrow? That adventurer is an angel of Mr. Fool?*
Lumian was astonished by the revelation.

The giant bishop continued, "There's also the Angel of Retribution
beside the Lord's throne. He is the Lord's lightning, the Lord's rage,
and the Lord's palm, the judge of all the fallen and the ones who aren't
chaste.

"Next to the Angel of Retribution is the Angel of the Holy Spirit,
reigning over all spirits and representing our lord in controlling the
spirit world.

"In contrast to Them, there are the Angel of Time and the Angel of
Stars.

"The Angel of Time was an angel of ancient times. He eventually
submitted to our Lord and now strikes the bell of Heaven.

"The Angel of Stars is a witness, a recorder, the eyes and ears of our
lord..."

Lumian listened attentively, finding it hard to believe that there were
eight angels by The Fool's divine throne.

Wasn't this strength too terrifying?

It seemed no different from an orthodox Church!

Suddenly, Termiboros's magnificent voice resounded, *"Do you believe
it?"*

"Why not?" Lumian replied in a hushed tone, as if reciting passages from
the bible.

After all, whose bible, even among the orthodox Churches, didn't have a
touch of exaggeration?

Even without embellishments, it was still impressive!
