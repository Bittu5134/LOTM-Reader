## Chapter 444: The Sinners' Leader

The brown male calf's front hooves delicately tapped the mismatch-sized
mechanical typewriter, careful not to press any keys accidentally.

Lumian toyed with the gold coin of misfortune, patiently awaiting
Bouvard's full response.

Seizing the opportunity, he swiftly reviewed the operation in his mind.

From the start, he had no intention of acting personally. First, he
wanted to try playing the role of a Conspirer. Second, he aimed to
improve the performance and teamwork of the small team members.

Considering Bouvard Pont-Péro's possessiveness, Lumian shifted his
attention to Paulina. Through Anthony Reid's repeated Psychological
Cues, the woman's accumulated resentment from the abuse had fermented,
turning into a seed that would sprout once her restraints were removed.

To make Bouvard lower his guard, allowing his Danger Premonition to only
trigger at the end, Lumian not only made Franca prepare against
divination but also had his companion masquerade as Paulina, making the
target believe subconsciously that the one tied up was the real Paulina.

Of course, she was the real deal. Before Bouvard cut the rope, Paulina
didn't hold any true grudge against him. Her sincere desire was to be
rescued, an emotion that couldn't be feigned. It was enough to convince
Bouvard without setting off his Danger Premonition.

Jenna's role was to launch an attack and provide suppression, preventing
the target from observing the environment or contemplating details. This
forced him to approach Paulina and escape from 20 Rue de la Terrasse
with his precious belongings as quickly as possible. Additionally, they
wanted the enemy to instinctively believe that the ambush centered
around the master bedroom. The room where the actual Paulina was held
was, therefore, relatively secure.

As Lumian had foreseen, Bouvard "sprinted" right into the trap.

Without focusing the conspiracy on Paulina, with Bouvard's Danger
Premonition, regardless of how convincing Franca's performance was or
how similar she looked to Paulina, he would have sensed it in advance
and sent his imps to confirm it cautiously.

*From this act, traps are the simplest and most direct conspiracy, while
conspiracies are the deepening and escalation of traps...*
Lumian sensed the potion's minute digestion and sighed inwardly.

Simultaneously, in her invisible state, Franca sensed no impending or
brewing danger as Bouvard's hooves struck the keys. She gradually
relaxed.

She couldn't help but recall her conversation with the Sinners
organization's liaison while impersonating Paulina. Her face flushed
red, and she felt intense embarrassment.

*How embarrassing! How fucking embarrassing!*

Finally, Bouvard completed his initial keyboard conversation.

Jenna ripped the paper filled with words from the mechanical typewriter
and swiftly read it to Lumian and Franca.

"More than two months ago, the Sansons went somewhere and haven't
returned yet.

"I don't know where that is. From what they said, it's related to
something important.

"Before this, Constace, the mistress of the Sansons, had already gone
mad. To prevent her from taking drastic actions when out of control and
attracting the attention of official Beyonders and affecting the other
members of the organization, her husband, Voisin Sanson, along with
their child, killed her and allowed her to return to the Lord's
kingdom."

*Purged due to madness? When did you get the impression that you weren't
mad? However, the extent of your madness isn't serious. You're at a
stage where your perspectives are distorted and abnormal. You even know
how to disguise yourself...* Lumian muttered silently after
hearing that.

From his perspective, ever since establishing a connection with the
entity known as Inevitability, those believers were no longer ordinary
people. They had more or less been corrupted and had potential mental
problems. At some point in time, they might completely lose their minds
or collapse.

If Lumian didn't possess Mr. Fool's seal and had the Beyonder
characteristics balancing things out, he would have been crazier and
more terrifying than Constace, whom Bouvard had mentioned.

Jenna, who stood between him and Bouvard, couldn't help but hiss. She
felt that it was a good thing to be ruthless to heretics.

Those people had lost their normal emotions. They killed their wife or
mother without hesitation!

If they could even do this to their loved ones, one could imagine how
they would treat the people around them!

"Who were the ones who went to the unknown place you mentioned?" Lumian
inquired.

*Tap! Tap! Tap!* The calf began typing on the keyboard again.

This time, it was much more proficient than before. Its answers appeared
character by character on the paper.

"Voisin Sanson is our leader. He received a revelation and led a few
Fate Appropriators in Trier to that place."

"Voisin Sanson is the leader of the Sinners organization?" Lumian asked
in surprise.

*According to I Know Someone, didn't Voisin Sanson choose to join the
Sinners organization because he was on the verge of bankruptcy and later
successfully changed his luck and obtained the power of boons?*

*Tap! Tap! Tap!* A new answer was printed on the paper and read
out by Jenna.

"He was the first to spread the faith of Inevitability in Trier. He
obtained godhood nearly three years ago and became a Circle Inhabitant.

"He likes to disguise himself. In front of his collaborators, he
pretends to only be a key member of the organization and not the
founder.

"His wife and children were all brought into the mysticism world by him
to become the bestowed of Inevitability. Apart from the deceased Roche,
his wife and three other children are now Fate Appropriators. Of course,
Constace has already been purged."

*A demigod---a Circle Inhabitant---actually interacted with Low- to
Mid-Sequence Beyonders like Loki and I Know Someone. He's truly sinister
and cunning... I wonder if I Know Someone and the others noticed. If
they didn't, they're truly living in their own world. They think the
people around them are fools who can be exploited and squeezed dry of
their value... Who's the hunter and who's the prey?* Lumian
mocked the two key members of April Fool's once again.

Simultaneously, he gained a deeper understanding of the Sinners
organization.

The cult had been established with the Sansons as its core.

As for how Voisin Sanson had come into contact with the faith of
Inevitability and obtained the boon of an evil god, that was another
matter.

From the looks of it, his business had failed, and he was on the brink
of bankruptcy. With no other choice, he had tried various things.

"Why didn't Voisin Sanson let Guillaume Bénet know he was the leader of
the Sinners?" Lumian attempted to confirm the details.

Guillaume Bénet was already a Sequence 5 Fate Appropriator, on par with
the Sansons and other key members. He was significantly stronger than
Bouvard Pont-Péro.

Once again, the calf satiated his desire to share information with his
typewriter.

"His Excellency Voisin believed Guillaume Bénet was overly ambitious. If
he's involved in core matters, it will make him arrogant and do
unnecessary things."

*To put it simply, Guillaume Bénet's early conduct of the sacrificial
ritual in Cordu had left Voisin dissatisfied. He believed that he had
messed up the descent of the Inevitability Angel. However, due to the
entity known as Inevitability not punishing the Fate Appropriator on the
spot, he could only suppress his dissatisfaction and temporarily accept
Guillaume Bénet before marginalizing him?* Lumian roughly
grasped Voisin Sanson's take on the matter from Bouvard's response.

He pondered for a moment and changed the question.

"Has Voisin Sanson occasionally contacted you after visiting that place?
What are you responsible for? Why do you think you need to be cautious
and not make any mistakes?"

The calf's proficiency with the mechanical typewriter increased once
more.

"Before His Excellency Voisin departed, he informed me that he wouldn't
contact me for three months and would only return after the matter was
concluded.

"Me and a few other members are responsible for managing different
businesses and contacting different believers. We want them to focus on
their prayers and businesses for the next three months and not cause any
trouble. Likewise for the few of us."

*Does Inevitability's oracle believe that the catastrophe will descend
within three months? It's been more than two months since Voisin Sanson
and company vanished... In less than three weeks, the problem will
definitely erupt? Time is of the essence...* Lumian inquired
about the Sansons and the Sinners organization's current situation, but
it was evident that Bouvard Pont-Péro didn't know much. He only knew
about the matters under him.

Finally, Lumian pointed at the items he had retrieved from the other
party's pocket and asked, "What are these? What's their purpose?"

The calf replied truthfully through the mechanical typewriter: "You were
holding a gold coin of misfortune made using the Luck Transference
Spell.

"I once encountered an extremely unlucky person and used the Luck
Transference Spell to give him a new life. As a result, he became a
believer of my lord. This gold coin of misfortune was the product of
that help."

*Once...* Lumian frowned and said, "How long can the Luck
Transference Spell of an Ascetic last?"

At the Alms Monk stage, he had relied on a ritual to transfer a target's
fate to a corresponding item. The effect could only last three days.
Beyond this time limit, if he didn't find another person to shoulder the
fate, it would return to the original owner and couldn't be transferred
again.

After becoming a Contractee, Lumian hadn't used the Luck Transference
Spell again. He could only estimate that the duration would increase to
somewhere in the vicinity of five to seven days based on the mystical
knowledge he had obtained.

As he spoke, he focused on the 5 verl d'or gold coin in his hand and
realized that it was entwined with blood-red---nearly black---luck. It
tried to spread towards him but failed to do anything.

*Ordinary misfortune can affect me, but extreme misfortune will affect
the intertwined fates of Termiboros and me. Without the corresponding
level, it can't shake the main stream...* Lumian made a
preliminary judgment.

The calf replied amidst the tapping: "Thirteen days is the limit of the
Luck Transference Spell. If I want to raise it further, I can only rely
on the abilities of a Fate Appropriator.

"In 13 days, if I don't have an enemy I need to deal with, I'll randomly
choose a target and subject him to misfortune. Then, when his misfortune
starts, I'll promote the power of Inevitability and help him change his
luck. I'll obtain another gold coin of misfortune and a new believer."

*Dammit, a perpetual motion machine!* Franca, in her
invisibility state, couldn't help but criticize.
