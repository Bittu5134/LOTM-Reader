## Chapter 296: Request

Gardner Martin was well accustomed to Lumian's straightforwardness. He
gave a slight nod and said, "If you want a quick trade, I have three
items of equal value to the Werewolf fang."

"The first is the Shadow Bracelet, a mystical item that lets you conceal
yourself within larger shadows. It can summon a Shadow Servant with a
few special abilities and can bring shadows to life to restrain targets
to some extent.

"It's a foreboding item. More than a third of those who've used it have
gone mad, while another third mysteriously disappeared without it, never
to be seen again. Many of those who remain seem fine, but they often
complain of tinnitus and hallucinate sounds.

"In recent years, unless there are special circumstances, no one has
dared to use this mystical item."

Lumian expressed his confusion through his gaze: *Then why are you
offering it to me? Do I look like a lunatic or an idiot to you?*

Gardner Martin smiled and explained, "I'm one of the few people who
hasn't encountered problems with the Shadow Bracelet. I know a way to
weaken its negative effects, but I can only tell you if you choose it."

*When did you start hallucinating that there's nothing wrong with
you?* Lumian suppressed his concerns and held his tongue.

He thought that Gardner Martin, who had been corrupted by the
abnormality at 13 Avenue du Marché, might not be any better than those
who had gone mad or disappeared mysteriously.

According to Madam Magician's description of corruption, the person
standing before him might not be the same Gardner Martin as before.

Gardner Martin glanced at Lumian and smiled. "Actually, there's no need
to be so reserved in front of me. That won't make you seem like a Hunter
who hasn't advanced to Sequence 6. If you say something that might
'provoke' me, I'll probably just respond with sarcasm. Look, isn't Albus
still alive and well?"

"Yes, Commanding Officer," Lumian replied, not revealing the secrets
that couldn't be disclosed to the Iron and Blood Cross Order.

Gardner Martin got up from his recliner and continued, "The second item
is a Beyonder characteristic left behind by a Spirit Medium. Do you know
what Beyonder characteristics are?"

Lumian answered calmly, "Killing a Beyonder creature will yield one of
the main ingredients for concocting a potion. Killing a Beyonder will
definitely yield the corresponding items, just like the transparent
golden-red ball from 'Hammer' Ait and this Werewolf fang."

"I believe these are Beyonder characteristics. They all correspond to a
potion. There's no need to gather additional main ingredients, right?"

Gardner Martin nodded approvingly. "That's right. Your judgment is
accurate."

Gardner Martin didn't go into detail about the Law of Beyonder
Characteristics Indestructibility, as if he believed it involved many
secrets Lumian couldn't grasp at the moment.

With his hands clasped behind his back, Gardner Martin paced in front of
the unlit fireplace.

"Spirit Medium. From its name, you can roughly guess the abilities of
the mystical item created from it. Of course, what you obtain depends on
an Artisan's ability.

"If I'm not mistaken, it should be an Eye of Death, allowing one to
disguise as a zombie and endure the effects of decay, cold, death, and
other auras. It can also identify the weaknesses of undead creatures and
directly communicate with natural spirits and various undead creatures
in the real world, using them for various magical effects. If you're
lucky enough, you might even have all of those abilities.

"Try not to carry this Beyonder characteristic with you. Otherwise,
you'll become the target of surrounding natural spirits and undead
creatures. You'll never know when you might suffer a bizarre attack."

*Impressive as it sounds, it's somewhat similar to a
Contractee---relying on other creatures to gain strength...*
Lumian pondered for a few seconds and asked, "And the third?"

Gardner Martin settled back into his recliner.

"It's also a Beyonder characteristic. If you carry it, you'll find
yourself rather lucky. This will be reflected in the details of various
matters.

"The corresponding Sequence name is Lucky One, but you have to remember
that reveling in luck is often a precursor to disaster. Also, it might
allow you to see things you shouldn't see."

*Sequence 7 of the Monster pathway?* Lumian recalled the
contents of Aurore's grimoires.

The Monster pathway, also known as the Fate pathway, was a pathway known
for its high spiritual perception and close connection to fate.

Lumian chuckled and said, "The Lucky One ultimately transformed into a
Beyonder characteristic in an unlucky manner? What an ironic joke."

Gardner Martin agreed. "Don't underestimate bad luck, and don't rely on
luck. Otherwise, you may also become a Beyonder characteristic."

"Very philosophical." Lumian took note of the words filled with
experience and lessons learned.

He carefully recalled Gardner Martin's introduction and realized that he
wasn't stingy with information about the corresponding Sequences.

Merely the descriptions of the abilities of a Spirit Medium and Lucky
One could fetch a good price at many mysticism gatherings.

Gardner Martin pointed at the blackish-green fang on the ground.

"It's a Werewolf Beyonder characteristic. Once transformed into a
mystical item, it should provide powerful self-healing abilities, allow
transformation into a werewolf, and grant a short burst of power at the
expense of rationality.

"But, as you saw, Werewolves are always affected by killing and
bloodlust. During the full moon or Blood Moon, there's the latent danger
of losing your mind and control.

"Have you decided which item to choose? If you choose the Beyonder
characteristics, I can help you contact an Artisan and assist with the
production fee. It's the reward you deserve for your contribution
tonight."

*Is the Artisan you're hiring a Saint? How will you react if you
discover that I'm hiding a Shadow Branch?* Lumian wondered,
seriously considering his options.

First, he eliminated the Shadow Bracelet, suspected to be a mystical
item of Mr. K's pathway. Mr. K might offer similar but better options in
his rewards soon. Besides, the negative effects of the Shadow Bracelet
were too perilous. Even if Gardner Martin claimed he could weaken them,
Lumian didn't dare take the risk.

Most importantly, such a risk was pointless.

*A Spirit Medium can compensate for my shortcomings, but it doesn't
complement the Shadow Branch. I can't create a mystical item with the
effect of lingering human-ghost emotions. Yes, some characteristics
overlap with a Contractee...*

*Lucky One can make the Shadow Branch always trigger suitable desires?
The Werewolf's rationality sacrifice and the influence of being
murderous and bloodthirsty are quite compatible with the Shadow Branch.
I wonder what kind of mystical item it would produce...*

After careful consideration that spanned a few minutes, Lumian made his
decision.

"I want Lucky One."

The main reason he gave up the Werewolf Beyonder characteristic was its
potential negative effect of losing rationality.

Others might find ways to reduce the impact, using it only when facing
enemies or avoiding certain lunar phases. But Lumian couldn't take that
risk. Losing his mind even once could lead to Termiboros exploiting him
and causing the seal to lose its balance.

Furthermore, he belonged to the Inevitability domain as a Beyonder in
some way. In the future, when he reached a higher Sequence, he might be
able to enhance the mystical item's effects through the Lucky One trait.

As for seeing things he shouldn't, Lumian already had the Mystery Prying
Glasses, so having something similar didn't bother him.

Gardner Martin seemed surprised. He had expected Lumian to choose
between the Spirit Medium Beyonder characteristic and Shadow Bracelet.

However, he quickly composed himself and didn't inquire further. With a
smile, he said, "Humans are obsessed with good luck."

The Boss of the Savoie Mob, Commanding Officer of the Iron and Blood
Cross Order, briefly left the activity room and went upstairs.

A few minutes later, he returned with a transparent glass jar, once used
to hold sweets.

Inside the jar lay a mercury-colored eyeball, swiveling left and right
as if it were alive.

"To carry and store it, place it in a narrow dark space," Gardner Martin
instructed as he wrapped the jar in black cloth.

Handing the item to Lumian, he added, "Change the jar every seven days."

"Thank you, Commanding Officer." Lumian put the glass jar containing the
Lucky One Beyonder characteristic into his pocket.

Gardner Martin didn't wonder why Lumian didn't ask him to contact an
Artisan. The true effects of a mystical item were something the wielder
wanted to keep as secret as possible. Seeking an unknown Artisan was
more conducive to secrecy.

Just as these thoughts crossed his mind, Lumian brought up the matter
himself.

"Commanding Officer, I'd like to exchange the free Artisan service for
other rewards."

Curious, Gardner Martin asked, "What reward do you desire?"

A grin crept across Lumian's face. "Help me find someone."

"Who?" Gardner Martin had a hunch.

Lumian's expression turned serious.

"Guillaume Bénet.

"Since you know I'm from Cordu, you must have seen the padre's wanted
poster.

"I've been tracking him, hoping to apprehend the heretic who caused
disaster for me. I just received information that he might appear in
Quartier de la Princesse Rouge next week. I'd like to request your
assistance in locating him, Commanding Officer."

Gardner Martin burst into laughter.

"I thought you wanted to handle it yourself, enduring pain, tracking
alone, and seeking revenge in secret.

"Nicely done. You've learned to leverage an organization's strength
sooner than I expected. That's something a Hunter must understand.

"I agree to your request."
