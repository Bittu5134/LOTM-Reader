## Chapter 1175: Bearer of the Eternal Aeon

Within the collapsing and burning space of consciousness centered on the
deep black point, Lumian, who had reverted to his three-headed,
three-torso, six-armed form, rested his two middle arms on the armrests
of the bloodstained throne. Leaning back against the chair, he calmly
observed as everything in this space headed toward destruction.

He was aware of the terrifying transformations resulting from the
collision of various symbolisms, but at this moment, he could neither
interrupt nor end what was happening.

Suddenly, he noticed that the Monarch of Decay, surrounded by the power
of Termination, had been replaced by an avatar of the Circle of
Inevitability, composed of redemptive light.

Lumian froze for a moment, then couldn't help but burst into laughter,
leaning forward slightly.

So, this is what the hint about utilizing 'the universe's most powerful
and genuine Angel of Redemption' truly meant.

Whenever a situation arose that could threaten the entire universe, the
godhood instinct of the Circle of Inevitability would compel Him to
perform redemption!

This was perhaps His most fundamental symbolism and the reason He had
been born as the child of the Original Creator and the Mother Goddess of
Depravity.

The Goddess of Fate symbolized the weaving of chaotic destiny into a
semblance of order, forming the foundation of the current River of Fate.
In contrast, the Circle of Inevitability symbolized the possibility of
salvation in apocalyptic crises brought about by the inherent chaos of
destiny, allowing the universe to continue in relative stability until
its ultimate end.

As the Sequence 1 avatar of the Circle of Inevitability Substituted the
Monarch of Decay within Lumian's collapsing body, the formation of the
Termination symbolism noticeably slowed. However, it did not stop
entirely and began accelerating once more.

Seeing this, the three bodies of the Circle of Inevitability
simultaneously formed identical hand signs.

His true body began to fade and contract, leaving behind only the light
of redemption. Meanwhile, the Angel of Redemption avatar within Lumian's
body rapidly expanded, sprouting a pitch-black Past Sinner Body and a
mercury-colored Present Sufferer Body.

The Circle of Inevitability used His true body to replace the avatar,
personally entering Lumian's body to face the encroaching power of
Termination!

The universe's most powerful and genuine Angel of Redemption!

The power of Termination continued to consume and collapse everything
within the consciousness space, pulling it toward the deep black point.
At this moment, the six arms of the Circle of Inevitability extended
simultaneously, cupping the terrifying black point as though holding a
lotus flower.

His three bodies simultaneously bore the ravages of the power of
Termination.

Then, the three bodies unfolded in a strange manner that defied human
anatomy, encircling the deep black point held in six palms, and began to
spin.

The spinning grew faster and faster. The black turned into mercury,
mercury became transparent redemptive light, and the light was dyed
black again, repeating over and over.

Before long, the pitch-black Past Sinner Body morphed into the initial
scene of the Termination power's formation. The mercury-colored Present
Sufferer Body stabilized the current event of destruction. The holy
light-formed Future Redemption Body froze the moment when the
Termination symbolism was about to emerge but had not yet fully formed.

Next, the Future Redemption Body, spinning rapidly, became dyed black
once more, transforming into the scene corresponding to the Past Sinner
Body.

Lumian's collapsing body suddenly reverted to its original state---the
state it was in when the Termination power had just begun to form but
had not yet transformed into symbolism. His broken limbs, chest,
abdomen, and other parts were all restored.

Eternal Aeon symbolism!

Using His Eternal Aeon symbolism, the Circle of Inevitability achieved
Redemption.

He immediately allowed His external Sequence 1 avatar to replace His
true body once again, sealing it within Lumian's body. The true body
returned to reality, regrowing the Past Sinner Body and the Present
Sufferer Body.

From now on, the Angel of Redemption avatar would slow the
transformation of Termination power within Lumian into Termination
symbolism. It would also assist in balancing the consciousness and
spirit of the reviving malevolent dragon. When the delayed
transformation once again reached a critical stage, the true body of the
Circle of Inevitability would replace the avatar, enter Lumian's
dreamscape, and use the Symbolism of Eternal Aeon to reset the crisis to
its initial state.

In essence, every day, His true body would endure destruction alongside
Lumian due to the Termination power. This cycle would repeat daily,
eternally!

Seeing that the crisis had been redeemed, the Circle of Inevitability
did not linger and departed for the astral world.

Neither the newly emerging Lord of Mysteries Klein, who had just stepped
through a Door, nor the massive crimson moon in the sky attempted to
stop Him.

After arriving at a distant region of the boundless universe through the
astral world, the Circle of Inevitability manifested the River of Fate
once more.

In the mercury-colored illusory river, His images, which originally
belonged to the Monarch of Decay, had been replaced by His own through
the influence of the Substitution symbolism.

This created a profound mystical link between Him and the Monarch of
Decay.

He discovered a series of weathered, decaying planets and began pursuing
the direction they pointed.

___

By the time the Circle of Inevitability had left, Lumian had regained
his balance. Once again, he was the genuine Origins of Disaster and
Calamity of Destruction, now carrying even more active and intense
masculine and feminine aspects of the mirrored Original Creator. These
aspects were nearing a convergence, poised to form a symbolism.

In an instant, Lumian understood his current situation.

For the next hour, he would remain in peak condition, able to wield the
full power of a Great Old Dominator. After that, his body would begin
collapsing, and the Disaster symbolism would become uncontrollable,
bringing calamities or disasters to the surrounding star dominion. Only
by entering slumber could he minimize such occurrences and slow the
completion of the Termination power's convergence.

This phase would last for 22 hours. The true body of the Circle of
Inevitability would replace the failing Sequence 1 avatar within
Lumian's dreamscape, endure destruction for an hour, achieve Eternal
Aeon, and reset Lumian's physical state to the beginning.

Realizing this, Lumian paused, feeling both amused and reflective.

In simple terms, I have a Sequence 1 Angel of the Inevitability pathway
sealed within me, resetting my physical state every 24 hours...

After all these twists and turns, it seems I'm back to the beginning...

However, the essence of fate was ultimately disordered, and the entire
situation didn't completely align---during the final hour, what was
sealed wasn't a Sequence 1 Angel of the Inevitability pathway but
Inevitability Himself. Moreover, the state didn't reset at 6 am every
day but at 12:30 pm.

After a moment of pause, Lumian raised his head.

The crimson moon high above descended once again.

The Mother Goddess of Depravity had once again returned!

Faced with this change, the figure of Lord of Mysteries Klein, clad in
his coat and top hat, grew abnormally enormous and rose to confront Her.

Origins of Disaster Lumian dashed without hesitation toward Primordial
Hunger, ready to replace Grisha Adam and confront this Great Old
Dominator.

Eternal Darkness Amanises first enveloped the nearly out-of-control
Grisha Adam in dense, silent darkness. With His cooperation, She helped
Him fall into slumber to delay the revival of the Primordial God
Almighty, then joined the Celestial Master and Celestial Thearch's
projection in Their fight against the High-Dimensional Overseer.

In the next second, She sensed that the heavily injured Inextinguishable
Ravings seemed to have returned!

Amanises instinctively analyzed the current situation to devise the most
appropriate response.

At this point, the Mother Tree of Desire, Monarch of Decay, and Circle
of Inevitability were no longer capable of returning to the fray and
could be eliminated from consideration along with the Uncertain Mist.
Among those remaining, the Supernova Dominator would remain sealed for
another two or three minutes, likely unable to rejoin the battle in
time, making Him a negligible factor. Meanwhile, the Goddess of Fate
would need another ten to twenty seconds to escape the labyrinth and
leave the spirit world.

In the immediate term, the only opponents to contend with were the
Mother Goddess of Depravity, Primordial Hunger, the High-Dimensional
Overseer, and the still-weakened Inextinguishable Ravings. However, if
the situation wasn't resolved swiftly and dragged on until the Goddess
of Fate returned, or until the Primordial God Almighty's revival
progressed beyond suppression, then hope would be lost, and defeat would
be certain.

With a precise understanding of the circumstances, Eternal Darkness
Amanises made a decisive call.

The Lord of Mysteries would hold off the Mother Goddess of Depravity.
Origins of Disaster Lumian would engage Primordial Hunger. The Knowledge
Moor, Nation of Disorder, and the soon-to-awaken Key of Light would
continue stalling the High-Dimensional Overseer. Amanises Herself would
leverage mutual restraint among the symbolisms to ensure that the
already gravely injured Inextinguishable Ravings would be forced out of
the battle---or even eliminated---within a short timeframe!

This had to be accomplished before the Goddess of Fate returned. The
Primordial God Almighty's revival should take slightly longer.

Amanises immediately caused the dense, silent darkness to spread
outward, seeking the formless Great Old Dominator and preparing to
manifest the name of Inextinguishable Ravings on the illusory book
coiled by feathered serpents.

At the same time, Lumian descended above Primordial Hunger.

The central body of his body reconstituted the burning Sword of
Destruction, and he projected a thought toward Ludwig at the edge of the
universe. "Call me Father!"

Ludwig, who had already devoured the Chaos Gastric Juices and was
playing a pivotal role within the Red Angel Legion, was momentarily
stunned before instinctively shouting aloud, "Father!"

At that moment, Primordial Hunger, shaped like a dark vortex, seemed to
hear another version of Himself calling the enemy above as "Father,"
utterly baffled.

But in the next instant, He sensed a familiar aura emanating from
Lumian---the aura of the one who created this world and would ultimately
end it. He saw the formation of all things and the freezing of the
universe.

Wh---

In the instinct of Primordial Hunger, a term emerged: "Father!"

He seemed to have encountered his true father!

He immediately began trembling and froze in the void.

Seeing this, Lumian smiled again.

Extracting the power of Primordial Hunger from the Box of the Great Old
Ones and helping Ludwig consume it wasn't just about creating a Sequence
1 Archangel to assist in defending the protected zones. Lumian had
intended to establish a symbolic connection!

Now, Ludwig carried power directly derived from Primordial Hunger. He
had long acknowledged Lumian as his godfather---his father.

This was a symbolism.

While projecting this symbolism onto Primordial Hunger wasn't easy,
Lumian carried both the masculine and feminine aspects of the mirrored
Original Creator, who was the genuine father of Primordial Hunger!

Of course, the symbolic connection between Ludwig and Primordial Hunger
remained too weak to truly equate Lumian to Primordial Hunger's father.
It could only create illusions and exert some influence. This would have
little effect on other Great Old Dominators, but for Primordial
Hunger---a being driven primarily by instinct---it might work well.

Coupled with Mr. Fool's Deceit, "perhaps" could become "certain." This
was why Lumian had first targeted the Monarch of Decay---so Mr. Fool
wouldn't be too occupied to help. Additionally, the contract seal could
only be applied to one target at a time to borrow a power. With
Foolishness, there could be no Deceit. Moreover, if Lumian had targeted
Primordial Hunger from the start, the Circle of Inevitability might have
intervened to save Him.

At this moment, Lumian did not seek Mr. Fool's assistance. After the
recent events, the masculine and feminine aspects of the mirrored
Original Creator within him had become far more active and substantial.

That was enough to deceive Primordial Hunger!

As Primordial Hunger stiffened briefly, Lumian ignited his entire body
in crimson flames. Wielding the Sword of Destruction, he descended from
the heavens and struck downward.

The blade hit the dark vortex of Primordial Hunger directly.

Primordial Hunger let out a headache-inducing howl of pain, and the dark
vortex spat out what it had recently swallowed but hadn't yet digested.

Terrified, He fled into the astral world, carrying the burning flames of
destruction and a body riddled with cracks. Panicked and disoriented, He
fled far away from the battlefield.

In just two seconds, Lumian had grievously injured Primordial Hunger,
driving Him away and completing his task.

In the name of the Father!
