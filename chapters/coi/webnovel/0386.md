## Chapter 386: Caution

In the dark and deserted back alley,

Lumian carefully navigated the maze of discarded refuse infested with
rats and cockroaches. His movements were deliberate, alternating between
rapid dashes and cautious steps, sudden changes in direction, and even a
few circles, as if he were evading an unseen pursuer.

Finally, he arrived at Rue des Blouses Blanches and entered the
seemingly "abandoned" safe house, whose lease had not yet expired.

Following a process, he pulled the heavy curtains shut and meticulously
inspected every corner of the room.

Compared to before, he not only eradicated the bedbugs and routed the
rats but he also left no room for tiny, rice-grain-sized flying insects.
He demanded absolute cleanliness.

With that done, Lumian seated himself at the table. He smoothed out a
sheet of paper and began to write.

"Honorable Madame Hela,

"When I took part in the April Fool's team discussion masquerading as my
sister, Muggle, I couldn't help but notice the peculiar reactions of
Hisoka, Mad Lady, Bard, and Ultraman upon Muggle's unexpected return
after her prolonged absence. I suspect 'I Know Someone' was the
psychiatrist Muggle sought in her final moments.

"Simultaneously, they were collaborating with Loki in a ruse, hoping to
entice members from other teams to embark on a subterranean quest for
the remains of the Ancient Sun God.

"I believe Loki is the de facto leader of April Fool's. If there's
anything awry with the others, it undoubtedly concerns him as well.
Consequently, I acquired a copy of the Ancient Sun God's information
from him and enlisted divination services to examine the mechanical
typewriter responsible for producing the text. It happened at the Alone
Bar on Rue Ancienne in Trier Quartier de l'Observatoire.

"Following some field investigation, it became apparent that this locale
serves as the stronghold for Bureau 8. However, Loki appears to have set
his sights on me. I was assaulted in the evening and narrowly escaped
becoming his marionette. My escape, though, exposed my true identity to
him.

"As I write this letter, I find myself in the safe house I had
previously prepared. Nevertheless, I can't be certain whether I have
eluded Loki's pursuit.

"I strongly suspect there's something amiss with him. If left unchecked,
he could pose a grave threat to the Research Society in the days ahead.

"I hope to receive your assistance."

Lumian felt no shame in laying out his intentions plainly.

His plan was to make himself the bait that would draw Loki out of
hiding, while Hela, with her ability to harness Concealment, would lurk
in the shadows, ready to deliver the decisive blow to the leader of
April Fool's.

Perhaps only Hela, with her superior Sequence and mastery of
Concealment, had a chance of evading detection and discovering the true
body of their bizarre and unkillable adversary.

After folding the letter, Lumian swiftly arranged the altar and summoned
the pure silver skull adorned with pale-white flames in its eye sockets.

Franca stealthily made her way back to Apartment 601 at 3 Rue des
Blouses Blanches. She used her persuasive abilities to convince Jenna to
temporarily vacate the premises for a couple of days.

Only after Jenna repeatedly confirmed that she would be of no assistance
did she reluctantly give up her facade of bravery, departing amidst a
string of curses.

Quickly, Franca changed into different attire and donned the disguise
props she had acquired from Rentas, a member of the Bliss Society,
transforming her appearance entirely.

As she applied makeup, she couldn't help but curse fate's mother.

*Dammit, I shouldn't have let Jenna go so soon! She's much better at
handling these things than me, and her makeup skills are
superior.*

Such skills were fundamental for an apprentice actress.

With a simple disguise in place, Franca seamlessly shifted between
invisibility and concealment within the shadows, weaving her way through
the market district.

She made a concerted effort to thwart any attempts at divination and
employed anti-tracking techniques learned from Lumian.

Finally, she returned to Rue des Blouses Blanches and entered Building
6.

This was the safe house she had prepared for herself, conveniently
overlooking her original residence.

*Phew...* Franca, having completed all the procedures, heaved a
sigh of relief and lay down in the Loen-style recliner.

Simultaneously, she muttered to herself, *I've only known Ciel for less
than three months. Why does it feel like I've experienced more in this
time than in the past year...*

*Is this guy some sort of jinx reincarnate?*

†

In the secure confines of the safe house on Rue des Blouses Blanches,
Lumian patiently waited for nearly fifteen minutes. Then, from the
abrupt darkness, the pure silver skull's head emerged, clutching a
simple folded letter in its skeletal teeth.

"Thank you," Lumian replied habitually, accepting the letter.

If Hela was unwilling to engage with a suspected member of the
Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society, Lumian had no choice but to
abandon his current plan and swiftly locate Franca. He would guide her
through Spirit World Traversal to distant locales like the hill
district, Quartier Éraste, and other suburbs before returning.

He felt that it was the only way to evade Loki's pursuit or lock-on.
Moving openly was out of the question unless he shifted to an entirely
different area.

Lumian unfolded the paper and discovered that Hela's response was
succinct: "Got it."

A wry smile curled at the corners of Lumian's mouth as he conjured
crimson flames from his hand, igniting the reply.

Without delay, he restored the table's surface to its ordinary state and
reverted to his original appearance, aided by the Lie earring.

Next, Lumian extinguished the carbide lamp and reclined on the bed,
closing his eyes and feigning slumber.

As minutes slipped away, night settled in, and Rue des Blouses Blanches
descended into stillness.

The crimson moonlight filtered through heavy curtains, casting a
subdued, eerie glow within the room.

After an indeterminate span of time, a small, grayish-black figure
emerged from a concealed crevice in the corner---a nondescript rat.

Soundlessly and stealthily, the rat approached the table, ascending its
surface. It moved about with deliberate intent, as if surveying its
territory for any signs of intrusion.

After a brief inspection, it halted its actions and retreated into the
shadowy corners untouched by the dim moonlight. Its body now faced the
bed.

The rat fixated its gaze upon Lumian with an unnervingly human-like
intensity.

It appeared to meld with the darkness, assuming a statue-like stillness,
completely immobile and unwavering in its focus on Lumian.

Nearly ten minutes passed, and faint, nearly imperceptible footsteps
echoed from the corridor outside the apartment.

*Tap, tap, tap.* The footsteps drew nearer.

Abruptly, the footsteps vanished as if they had never been or had come
to a standstill at some unseen juncture.

The rat retreated from the shadowy realm untouched by the crimson
moonlight, traversing the table and vanishing through the same crevice
it had emerged from.

With swiftness, it disappeared, leaving the room in an even deeper
silence, broken only by the faint sound of Lumian's slow, rhythmic
breathing.

Lumian didn't open his eyes. His body was very relaxed, as if he had
truly fallen asleep.

6 Rue des Blouses Blanches, in an apartment.

Franca reclined in the recliner, swaying back and forth with the chair.

Troubled, she pondered what to do next. With such a bizarre and
terrifying foe lurking in the shadows, the constant sense of being
watched had left her restless, and she couldn't find solace whether
sitting or standing.

*I need to resolve this quickly. One can be a thief for a thousand days,
but how can you guard against a thief for a thousand days? One misstep,
and it's all over...*

*Why don't I abandon the mission and relocate? Or I can go all out and
ask Madam Judgment for help to apprehend Loki under the pretext that the
mission will likely fail. It's feasible, but I'll shoulder a debt that I
won't be able to repay until I become a demigod. Even if Ciel takes half
of it, it'll be a heavy burden...*

*We can also ask Madam Hela to convene an emergency gathering and accuse
Loki and the others of causing Muggle's death on the spot. We can
request that we find reliable members to interrogate each other and see
which side is lying. Uh, we can't be entirely sure if there's really
something wrong with Loki and the others, but it's certain that I
colluded with an outsider and lured in a spy...*

The more Franca thought about it, the more frustrated she became. She
used proverbs from her homeland and didn't deliberately change it.

Suddenly, an overwhelming sense of danger gripped her, and
simultaneously, an eerie chill crawled up her spine.

Her body stiffened, and a figure reflected in her lake-like eyes.

Clad in a short black formal suit typical of clerks, with neatly combed
brown hair, a face bearing Southern Continent heritage, and dull green
eyes...

*Wraith!* The word flashed through her mind as she recognized
the nature of the impending attack.

Franca's thoughts became hazy, and her right hand instinctively rose, as
if resisting an unseen force.

She channeled the spirituality within her Soul Body, preparing to
unleash the black flames of a Demoness.

This ability targeted a Spirit Body and was capable of incinerating
Wraiths. Demonesses possessed a heightened resistance to such flames
compared to other pathways, and they could even use injuries to escape
or severely harm their adversaries.

At that moment, Franca heard a magnetic voice.

*"It's futile. Surrender."*

The sound pierced Franca's mind like sharp arrows, interrupting her
attempt to condense the black flames.

As soon as the voice faded away, her mind seemed to be shrouded in a
thick fog, and a thick frosted glass appeared in front of her.

The voice continued, *"I didn't use my full strength in the evening to
test the waters. The person impersonating Muggle with a high-level
existence sealed in him must possess some special abilities. If I hadn't
done my best to gather information, I might have been the one to
die.*

*"After the probe, things got even more interesting. I went to his place
just now and felt that it wasn't safe enough. Therefore, I planned to
turn you into my marionette and launch a surprise attack.*

*"Heh heh, do you think you can escape my grasp? There's something
special about us. As long as we're within a kilometer of each other, I
can use the power of a great existence to sense your location.*

*"I've long yearned for a Demoness to be my marionette. It'll definitely
taste good..."*

Franca's Spirit Body was repeatedly affected by the sound, interrupting
her efforts to activate Mirror Substitution and condense black flames in
advance. Her thoughts became increasingly sluggish, and her joints felt
as if they were filled with glue.

*Can... Loki... sense... my location?*

*What's... so special... Why... can he...*

Before Franca could piece together any answers or formulate a complete
response, the magnetic voice, now with a sinister smile, continued, *"I
can't waste any more time. I must accelerate to avoid unforeseen
complications."*

At this point, the voice turned respectful and recited in Franca's
unusually familiar language, "The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth for
Blessings;

"The Sky Lord of Heaven and Earth for Blessings..."
