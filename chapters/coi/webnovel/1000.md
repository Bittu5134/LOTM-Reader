## Chapter 1000: Gaze

Jenna looked at the smile on Franca's face and listened to her calm
words tinged with self-mockery. She suddenly felt a lump in her throat.

Her gaze swept over the monster children about to break through the
newest ice wall, over the collapse that had already swallowed the
transfer bed and the orderly. She bit her lip hard and said, "Okay..."

The rest of her words got stuck in her throat, as if ice had melted into
hot water.

She could only tell herself that future problems would be solved in the
future, and that they would surely find a solution!

Franca estimated the time and began preparing the Despair potion using
the black eyeball from the reanimated corpse and the corresponding
supplementary materials. Jenna allowed the wet feeling to spread from
the corner of her eye to the edge of her face while focusing on blocking
the approach of the monster children.

She no longer created her own Disease, leaving these oddly-shaped
targets all to Franca.

After the monster children were born, she had also been quietly
spreading mystical pathogens.

Luo Shan, who was bewildered and inexplicably terrified by the
conversation between the two, also reined in her thoughts and began
adding various patterns to Jenna's ice wall to enhance its defense.

In the burst of light, the monster children were unable to break through
the ice wall in the shortest time and advance further.

Behind them, the floor tiles of the corridor, the walls on both sides,
and the ceiling above kept collapsing. The bottomless dark abyss was
getting closer and closer to them.

After a while, some of the monster children began to cough violently,
coughing so hard that they slid down from the surface of the ice wall.
Others became rigid and could no longer move smoothly.

Those crowded outside the ice wall, separated from Jenna and the others
by several meters, were finally caught up by the collapse.

They surged forward like a tide but couldn't get past the bodies of
their siblings.

They began to fall towards the dense darkness hiding unknown terrors.

Strong feelings of despair emanated from them, rapidly spreading to
their companions clinging to the ice wall surface as their conditions
worsened.

*Now!* Franca raised the bottle, bringing the deep purple potion
bubbling with rosy bubbles to her lips.

She drank it without hesitation.

The potion had no taste, or perhaps Franca could no longer distinguish
its taste.

She only felt her spirit and thoughts rapidly falling into a lightless,
enclosed darkness, plummeting towards an unknown depth.

Something seemed to be calling her there.

Trier, inside a luxurious villa.

Franca, sleeping on the bed, still had her eyes tightly shut, but her
hair eerily began to float, gradually growing longer, darker, and
thicker.

Madam Judgment, standing guard in the villa's living room, instantly
sensed something and Blinked into Franca's room.

Looking at the transformed Franca, Madam Judgment didn't rush to act.
Instead, she took out a charm made of gray-white dragon scales,
activated it, and made it ethereal.

"There's been a change in the dream. Two of Cups was forced to advance
to Demoness of Despair within the dream," Madam Judgment's words
combined with the ethereal charm, quickly becoming transparent and
merging into the night sky.

At this moment, Madam Judgment felt a certain gaze, a gaze from the
Traveler's Bag, from an unknown place, a gaze upon Franca.

Dream city, Mushu Hospital, B2.

Franca's consciousness and spirit floated and fell within the enclosed
darkness. She felt countless invisible threads of intense despair
extending from the outside world, following their mystical connections
to grasp her body.

At the same time, she saw two brilliant starry lights.

Those were the people she cared about, and who cared about her, the
anchors that let her know who she was!

The groggy Franca gradually regained clarity, vaguely sensing a gaze
full of resentment, hatred, and expectation watching her from somewhere
in the deep darkness.

Suddenly, her Traveler's Bag outside the spiritual world began to
vibrate, a vibration she could clearly perceive.

It was the Primordial Demoness figurine carved from white bone that was
noticeably trembling.

At the same time, Franca discovered an indescribable gaze from above
directed at her, penetrating through layers of mirror worlds!

Her hair instantly turned completely black, floating in the air like
tentacles, with their tips swelling into spheres, as if about to open
into numerous eyes.

Franca's face became even more beautiful, emanating a charm that even
made Luo Shan, a girl who preferred the opposite sex, unable to look
away, her heart pounding, like a moth throwing itself into the fire.

Franca struggled to open her eyes and spoke in a voice that seemed to
pluck at the strings of the soul, "It's done..."

Jenna stopped maintaining the ice wall and activated the Ice Mirror
Charm she had been holding.

In the crystalline light, she felt the surface of the mirror in her
other hand ripple with a faint glow, losing its rock-solid texture.

They really could pass through and leave via the mirror world!

The barrier had been broken!

Moreover, Jenna discovered that the dangers previously hidden in the
mirror world had also disappeared.

This was beyond her expectations. She had originally thought that the
Primordial Demoness's gaze could break through the obstacles and connect
to the mirror world, which would have been impressive enough. She never
imagined it could actually dispel the hidden dangers.

This was also Franca's confusion.

She struggled to tell Jenna and Luo Shan, "Both of you... go first..."

She was still fighting against the potion's impact, transforming her
body, and temporarily unable to move.

If the mirror world hadn't suppressed this advancement to Sequence 7
level, she wouldn't even have been able to speak at this stage!

Jenna didn't hesitate. She gave Franca a deep look, grabbed Luo Shan's
arm, and plunged into the compact mirror in her hand.

The compact mirror then fell to the ground as the surrounding ice wall
completely collapsed.

However, the monster children closest to Franca had all been infected
with severe illness and were no longer able to approach or attack.

In the mirror world, Jenna led Luo Shan through a surreal tunnel,
heading towards a corresponding mirror guided by their spirituality.

In the blink of an eye, they reached a new area behind the mirror, able
to leave the current world.

Jenna suddenly sensed something and turned her head to look into the
depths of the mirror world.

It seemed that some dangerous entity had awakened slightly there,
instantly filling the entire mirror world with a sense of terror.

Silently, the mirror world completely collapsed.

"Franca..." Jenna's pupils dilated as she softly called out her
companion's name.

The scene before her eyes meant that Franca would temporarily be unable
to escape via the mirror world, and by the time the mirror world
recovered, the Primordial Demoness's gaze would likely have ended, and
the force isolating the inside from the outside would reappear!

Blood trickled from Jenna's lips as she endured the pain invading her
mind. Before the terrifying collapse of the mirror world could rapidly
spread to them, she pulled Luo Shan and emerged from the mirror surface.

She knew that blindly returning would only lead to them getting lost in
the spatiotemporal turbulence deep in the mirror world, which would be
of no help in rescuing Franca.

She planned to go to the first floor of Mushu Hospital and take the
elevator back to the underground area!

At this moment, Franca, still in the process of advancing, also
discovered the collapse of the mirror world.

She then felt violent tremors like an earthquake at the bottom of the
dark abyss.

It was as if certain entities hidden in the dark abyss had been
stimulated by the collapsing force of the mirror world and were
reacting.

With these tremors, the corridor beneath Franca's feet that had not yet
been affected by the collapse suddenly gave way, carrying her and
hundreds of monster children into the bottomless dark abyss.

*Dammit!* Franca hadn't expected this development.

The despair of those monster children became even more intense,
solidifying into substance. Franca was also uncontrollably enveloped by
the emotions of despair.

This helped her through the final stage of her advancement, causing her
floating thick black hair to fall back around her, no longer abnormal,
and restoring some of its flaxen color.

Gritting her teeth, Franca used the Demoness's feather-fall technique to
slow her descent, allowing her some degree of control.

She chose to move away from the intense psychological shadow she had
sensed earlier, that thing resembling a giant shroud, which would surely
make her wish for death.

She drifted towards other areas, taking a gamble.

*What if the psychological traumas in other parts of the abyss, though
intense, aren't fatally dangerous?*

*As a human, one must hold onto some hope, not give up entirely and fall
into complete despair!*

Jenna emerged from the metal mirror surface of the elevator lobby doors
with Luo Shan, immediately seeing the female version of Lumian who had
just lifted her gaze from the shaking ground.

She wasn't surprised to see Lumian here and blurted out, "Franca is
below, not at B1!

"The mirror world has collapsed!"

Lumian's eyes instantly narrowed.

He didn't ask for details but said directly, "Go to the emergency center
and find Zhou Mingrui. See if you can get him to help and go to the
underground area.

"As for the rest, leave it to me. I'll handle it."

*Zhou Mingrui is at Mushu Hospital now?* Both Jenna and Luo Shan
were shocked.

Before Jenna could speak, Lumian added in a deep voice, "I had
anticipated scenarios where we might have to enter the bottom of Mushu
Hospital to attempt sabotage and made some preparations.

"Everyone has their own task. Finding Zhou Mingrui is equally
important!"

As he spoke, Lumian had already reached the elevator and pressed the
down arrow.

Jenna's vision suddenly blurred.

She didn't stubbornly insist, but gave a terse response and pulled Luo
Shan towards the emergency center.

She knew they couldn't put all their eggs in one basket. She knew she
couldn't be selfish now. She knew that without godhood, even if she went
to the bottom of Mushu Hospital, she probably couldn't be of much help
and might even burden Lumian and Franca.

She wished she didn't know these things.

At this moment, she felt her own weakness due to the intense pain, and
because of her weakness, she felt even more pain, giving rise to an
extreme desire and motivation to change this situation.

Her Affliction potion was fully digested.

Lumian entered the elevator and pressed the "B2" button.

As the elevator began to descend, Lumian looked at his stunningly
beautiful reflection in the metal mirror surface with a grim expression.

When the elevator stopped and the doors opened, he quickly stepped out
and looked towards the area outside the elevator.

What met his eyes was a darkness as black as an abyss with no visible
bottom.

Lumian's gaze instantly froze.

Suddenly, a voice sounded from a dark corner of the elevator lobby.
"Child of God."

Lumian abruptly turned his head to see a person standing in the shadows
by the emergency exit.

It was Lu Yong'an, the dean of obstetrics at Mushu Hospital and a
bestowed of the Great Mother.

Lu Yong'an's face was shrouded in darkness. She looked at Lumian and
said in a low voice, "To save someone from there, one can only beseech
the Mother's help."
