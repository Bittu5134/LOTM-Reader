## Chapter 293: "Pious"

*Inviting me to join your team without even checking my background or
confirming my strength? Are you that confident, Mr. Fool's
Oracle?* Lumian couldn't help but criticize, feeling unsure
about the whole situation.

He looked at Blazing Danitz and responded with a smile, "No."

Blazing Danitz acknowledged tersely, his voice gaining intensity as if
confirming it for the last time.

Lumian slipped his right hand into his pocket, maintaining his smile.

"Not interested."

*What a joke. How can I complete the Tarot Club's mission if I join your
team?*

*This requires your consultation with Madam Magician!*

Danitz's dark-blue yet bright eyes narrowed slightly, his aura instantly
becoming more intense.

Lumian felt as if he were facing a spear or a loaded gun pressed to his
forehead. Fear and danger washed over him.

However, he didn't look away and met Blazing Danitz's gaze with a calm
determination, as if facing an apex predator.

After a brief silence that filled the air with tension, Blazing Danitz
broke into a smile.

"Not bad. You're quite resolute and bold. I admire you even more."

With those words, the former great pirate, now The Fool's Oracle, turned
around and strolled towards the well-lit street in the distance.

*Confidence naturally breeds resoluteness...* Lumian thought
silently as he withdrew his right hand from his pocket, revealing a
tarot card held between his thumb and index finger.

The tarot card---Seven of Wands!

Though he couldn't fathom Blazing Danitz's impromptu recruitment, he
felt somewhat glad to have encountered Mr. Fool's Oracle.

This meant that The Fool Church held substantial strength in Trier.

After leaving Lavigny Docks, Lumian hopped onto a public carriage and
soon arrived at Avenue du Boulevard. He walked to 19 Rue Scheer and met
Mr. K beneath the headquarters of the Psychic organization.

The Aurora Order Oracle remained seated in the red armchair, his face
concealed in the deep shadows of his black hood.

His voice rasped as he inquired, "How's your progress in gaining Gardner
Martin's trust?"

Lumian replied calmly, "I've already joined the Iron and Blood Cross
Order."

Mr. K fell silent for a moment before asking, "How did you gain Gardner
Martin's trust? How did he test you? And how did you pass the test?"

The Aurora Order Oracle altered his usual demeanor, posing three
questions at once.

Lumian chuckled.

"Well, there was no need to gain Gardner Martin's trust. Simply joining
the Iron and Blood Cross Order earned loyalty."

Upon hearing this, Mr. K, who had been reclining in his chair, sat up
straight. The shadows in the basement seemed to stir, almost alive.

With his expertise and knowledge, discerning the hidden meaning behind
Lumian's words wasn't difficult for him.

And it undoubtedly spelled danger: Lumian had indeed become a member of
the Iron and Blood Cross Order, pledging his allegiance to them. He was
here to report while bringing the powerful figures of the Iron and Blood
Cross Order!

Lumian smiled, unfazed by the immense pressure radiating from Mr. K. He
proceeded to recount how he informed Gardner Martin that he had become a
Sequence 7 Pyromaniac, leading up to the vigil at 13 Avenue du Marché
and the formal initiation ceremony.

He didn't hold back the fact that he had engaged in an underground
transaction and fled in terror after encountering Supervisor Olson's
monstrous creation.

As Lumian finished, Mr. K stood up, excitement in his tone as he
verified Lumian's various details at 13 Avenue du Marché repeatedly.

Upon realizing that Lumian had used the honorific name at a crucial
moment and received a divine revelation of "don't respond," Mr. K burst
into a fit of maniacal laughter.

"Hahaha, hahaha, just as I thought, piousness is the only way out!"

The hooded Oracle's laughter grew wilder, echoing through the basement,
making Lumian's eardrums tremble and a faint scent of salt and blood
fill the air.

"Hahaha! Hahaha!"

Mr. K laughed so hard he nearly doubled over.

He no longer concealed his condition. The whole basement seemed
enveloped in darkness, and he stood as the source of danger behind it
all.

After a while, Mr. K paid no mind to Lumian's presence, instead kneeling
down, lowering his body to pray almost silently, as if thanking the Lord
that created everything, the omnipotent and omniscient God.

Lumian managed to keep his lips from twitching. Before leaving for
Lavigny Docks, he had performed a ritual, praying to The Fool for the
angel's protection. He praised the True Creator of the Aurora Order and
drew a cross on his chest, following an up-to-down, left-to-right order.

With a sudden display of piousness, Mr. K stood up and said with fervor,
"This was all arranged by the Lord. He brought you here to join us."

*It depends on which lord you're talking about...* Lumian
muttered, finding amusement in the situation, and replied humbly, "What
He says will come true."

This was one of the religious texts of the Aurora Order taught by Mr. K.
Lumian had always regarded it as a sermon praising the deity's strength.
He found it quite useful in the present conversation.

The hooded Mr. K nodded, thoroughly satisfied.

"I had arranged for others to approach the exposed members of the Iron
and Blood Cross Order before, but they lost contact with me and stopped
reporting. They even put me in considerable danger.

"Now I understand why they failed. Their lack of piousness! In the face
of danger and corruption, they didn't even think to recite our Lord's
honorific name and seek His protection!

"But you, at the critical moment, had only my Lord in your mind. That's
the kind of piousness I admire the most.

"That's why you successfully joined the Iron and Blood Cross Order
without being corrupted!"

*With only faith in a deity left in your mind... Will this affect your
intelligence?* Lumian observed Mr. K, gaining a deeper
understanding of his state of mind and way of thinking.

Mr. K paced back and forth in front of Lumian, his excitement palpable
in his voice.

"Based on the information you brought back, I now have a better
understanding of the Iron and Blood Cross Order's problems. I have a new
insight into their current situation and their intentions.

"I can say you've completed half of the mission I assigned you. Next,
you need to investigate the source of the abnormality, the exact
timeline, and their roadmap for inciting the riot.

"If they find a way to enter Fourth Epoch Trier or a passageway, you
must inform me immediately. Don't let them succeed."

Mr. K pondered for a few seconds and said, "The first option is to take
out my finger and ignite it. As long as the environment isn't special, I
can sense it and roughly understand the cause.

"If that doesn't work, pray to my Lord immediately, just like this
time."

"Alright," Lumian agreed.

When the time came, he might have to try contacting Madam Magician. It
seemed like he would be very busy.

After assigning the subsequent mission, Mr. K looked at Lumian in a
friendly tone and asked,

"Since you've completed half of the mission and brought back crucial
information, I can't be stingy with the rewards. Tell me, what do you
want?"

"I want a mystical item of bizarre nature. If you don't have it, a
corresponding Beyonder characteristic will do. I'll find an Artisan to
craft it myself," Lumian answered without hesitation.

Mr. K let out a chuckle.

"You deserve that. Come back in three days. I'll give you a few choices,
or I'll offer what I think suits you best."

"Thank you, Mr. K," Lumian expressed his sincere gratitude.

This was much more generous than what the Iron and Blood Cross Order
offered!

"It's not me you should be thanking, but the Lord," Mr. K replied with a
smile.

Helpless, Lumian drew the cross again.

"Praise be to you, the creator of all things. Praise be to you, who
carries the burdens of the world's sins."

Mr. K chimed in, praising the True Creator.

"Unfortunately, our Aurora Order doesn't have things like godfathers or
godchildren. Otherwise, I'd be more than willing to baptize you again."

*Why do so many people express their admiration by wanting to be someone
else's father? *Lumian found it amusing.

*†*

In high spirits after Mr. K's assurance, Lumian made his way back to
Auberge du Coq Doré. He headed straight to the basement bar and ordered
a glass of the unique textured distilled lemon liquor. As he chatted
with the others, he found amusement in Charlie's return, spreading all
sorts of rumors.

Meanwhile, intermittent singing and clapping rhythms filled the air,
creating a lively atmosphere that lasted until the early hours of the
morning. When the customers, who had to work at dawn, finally departed
to their residences, the bar quieted down.

Lumian realized he had been spending too many nights at Auberge du Coq
Doré lately, neglecting his sleep at Salle de Bal Brise. He decided it
was time to balance things out and head there next.

As he left Auberge du Coq Doré and walked along Rue Anarchie, where
there were no gas street lamps, he noticed a figure emerging from the
dark shadows ahead.

The person was almost as tall as Lumian, with broad shoulders and a
muscular build, dressed in a linen shirt, a brown jacket, and a
brownish-yellow wide-brimmed hat.

Gray hair adorned their head, and dark eyes stared intently. The man's
hairy skin added to his rugged appearance, giving off a wild sense of
beauty.

Having halted Lumian, the man, whose age was difficult to gauge from his
appearance, lifted his chin slightly and inquired, "Are you Ciel
Dubois?"

*Do you truly think yourself worthy of addressing me by my
name?* Lumian contemplated responding in a similar manner,
uncertain of the man's intentions, and sensing a hint of arrogance.
Thus, he chose to pretend.

He asked cautiously, "And who might you be?"

The man remained composed, showing no signs of being affected. With a
cold expression, he pressed on, "Tell me who the boss of your Savoie Mob
is."
