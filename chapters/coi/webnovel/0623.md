## Chapter 623: Grave Digging

In the endless darkness, cramped quarters, and jumbled thoughts, Lumian
found himself unusually frustrated, even within the confines of his
dreams. He longed to rip apart the cage around him and shatter
everything in his path.

Slowly, the realization dawned upon him that he was dreaming. He
struggled to open his eyes and wake up, but his efforts were in vain.
Each time he thought he had finally awakened, in the blink of an eye, he
plunged into a deeper darkness and a more profound dream.

After an unknown stretch of time, Lumian naturally awoke to some light
seeping through the curtained window.

It was 6 a.m.

Lumian raised his right hand and wiped his forehead, sensing a layer of
cold sweat.

*Is this a spiritual warning, or had memories of the Samaritan Women's
Spring and the afterimage of the Blood Emperor haunted me after I
contemplated the smell of death on Hanth Island yesterday? Previously, I
had drawn connections between the mysterious deaths of those who
witnessed the Demon and the Montsouris ghost, possibly leading to a
shallow corruption?* Lumian couldn't accurately decipher the
complete meaning of the dream. All he could do was remind himself to be
cautious and stay focused on his original goal for coming to Hanth
Island:

To investigate the Demon legends, not to eliminate the Demon.

Setting aside whether he possessed the strength to face the Demon or if
he needed assistance, the fact that the Church of Earth Mother had
operated on the island for over a century without completely eradicating
the target suggested even the Tarot Club's Major Arcana card holders
might not resolve this matter entirely.

Lumian got out of bed and retrieved the golden pocket watch from Salle
de Bal Brise. Opening and glancing at it: 6:01 a.m.

Though early, Lumian felt a sense of urgency. The Berries would depart
from Hanth Island the morning after tomorrow. He had only two days to
delve into the Demon legends, unravel the truth, and identify potential
suspects.

If he succeeded, his Conspirer potion might very well be digested.

Gathering, screening, and utilizing information were crucial aspects of
a conspiracy!

And if Lumian were a Sequence 7 Detective of the Reader pathway,
successfully solving a century-old unsolved case involving high-level
powers in just two days would be a remarkable leap from initial
digestion to complete digestion.

___

At 9 a.m., in the suburbs of Port Hanth, Return Cemetery.

Holding a bunch of yellow flowers, Lumian navigated through the
tree-lined cemetery.

Armed with Ludwig's intel and the insights from the previous night's
dream, he adjusted his plan. Instead of hastily venturing into the
forest to search for the missing people's remains, he decided to dig up
graves here!

His objective: to investigate the circumstances surrounding the
mysterious death of someone who had glimpsed the Demon's figure in the
forest depths. He aimed to discover if they would meet the same fate as
those killed by the Montsouris ghost---exhibiting self-mutilation.

According to the gathered information, the last person to report the
Demon's presence to the Church of Earth Mother rested in a quiet corner
of Return Cemetery.

His name was Antonio Elias.

Before long, Lumian, clutching the bouquet of yellow flowers, reached
the grave. Apart from the deceased's name, birth and death dates, a
concise epitaph adorned the stone tombstone: "This wretched man's life
was taken by a Demon."

Lumian stooped down, placing the bouquet before the tombstone. Then, he
straightened up, silently studying the stone tomb.

Details about Antonio Elias flashed through his mind.

*A local, not a foreigner, with parents, a wife, and children. Nine
months ago, during a hunting trip in the forest, he encountered a
wandering Demon. Fearing his imminent demise, he sought refuge in the
cathedral and cloister of the Church of Earth Mother for a full five
months. Afterwards, intending to serve as a crew member for three years,
steering clear of Hanth Island and its hidden dangers, he was discovered
dead at the bottom of the cabin on his second voyage...*

Lumian scanned the surroundings, gathering ten to twenty withered
branches from beneath nearby trees. He planted them around Antonio
Elias's tomb, forming a short, makeshift, and somewhat futile barrier.

Lastly, he laid a withered branch flat on two adjacent branches,
constructing a shaky door impassable to anyone.

With that completed, Lumian stepped over the "wall" and entered the
grave.

He then bent down, extending his right hand to touch the makeshift door
constructed of withered branches.

Simultaneously, a black mark activated on his body.

In the blink of an eye, Lumian's figure vanished. Antonio's tomb
remained undisturbed, except for the added circle of withered branches.

In reality, Lumian had retrieved an iron pick, shovel, and other items
from his just-purchased Traveler's Bag. He began prying open the stone
slabs and digging into the soil.

Bottle of Fiction!

Lumian utilized the "wall" and "door" he had fashioned to employ the
Bottle of Fiction contract ability.

In less than two minutes, relying on his understanding of the cemetery's
layout and two precise explosions, Lumian cleared the soil from the
coffin and pried open the black-painted wooden plank.

A pungent odor of decay wafted out, and Lumian casually ignited it.

After a brief wait, he squatted down, donned gloves, and examined the
white bones, now devoid of flesh and blood.

The first item he picked up was Antonio Elias's skull. With a cursory
glance, he noted cracks on the inside of the skull, while the exterior
remained intact.

*A brain explosion as the cause of death?* Lumian pondered the
force required to induce such damage. Regardless of the ability
responsible, Antonio's cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem should have
exploded into mush at the time of his demise. It seemed illogical for
the hard inner cranium to crack while the soft brain remained unharmed.

Examining Antonio Elias's other bones yielded no additional injuries.
The stains in the coffin offered no further clues.

Lumian concluded that Antonio's death resulted from an internal
explosion in his head. The explosive force, while not physically strong
enough to shatter his skull entirely, was sufficient to destroy his
brain.

*With Fire Infusion, I can precisely control the quantity and quality of
the flames. I should be able to achieve a similar effect. How did the
Demon do it?* Lumian's comprehension of the Demon pathway came
from his sister's grimoires, information provided by the Tarot Club, and
Franca's account. He had only truly interacted with a Demon above
Sequence 6 once, and that was with Naboredisley.

He immediately recollected the sensations when Naboredisley stirred his
desires and emotions. The echoes of the ranting transmitted through the
gray fog during Naboredisley's expulsion and the tumult of his own
desires replayed in his mind.

*For ordinary people, inducing an upheaval in their desires before
detonating them could lead to their brains exploding, given an increase
in potency... It shouldn't be a challenging feat for a demigod creature
like a Demon. Moreover, the Demon can use those ravings to achieve this
remotely?* As Lumian completed his deduction, he was convinced
that a Demon was indeed concealed on Hanth Island. A Demon of the
Criminal pathway, a Demon surpassing Sequences like Devil and Desire
Apostle.

With this confirmation, Lumian believed it would be relatively
straightforward to locate the Demon if he put his mind to it.

However, the prerequisite was finding it and not resolving the
situation, all while risking his life.

Removing the glove, he reached into his Traveler's Bag and touched the
Flog boxing gloves.

Following the incident with the Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for
Blessings and the Great Mother, Lumian had already speculated that the
Mother Tree of Desire stood at the peak of the Prisoner, Criminal, and
Scrooge pathways. Therefore, the Rose School of Thought's indulgence
faction and some members of the Devil family believed in Her and
followed Her.

In that case, the Flog boxing gloves made from the branches of the Tree
of Shadow, closely related to the Mother Tree of Desire, had a high
chance of attracting the Demon's attention within a certain range. Just
as its negative effects meant being observed by some hidden entities,
influenced and attacked by dangerous creatures!

*Phew, there are no useless items. Only Beyonders who don't know how to
use them.* Lumian chuckled self-deprecatingly and withdrew his
right hand from the Flog boxing gloves.

He abandoned the plan to directly lure out the Demon.

This decision stemmed from the realization that the Demon was still
active on the island, claiming lives, yet the Church of Earth Mother
hadn't eradicated it completely!

Having encountered various challenges, Lumian possessed a reasonable
understanding of an orthodox Church's strength. He knew that if the
Church of Earth Mother genuinely committed, it could eliminate all
residents suspected to be Demons and obliterate the island, similar to
what the Church of Storms had done to Bansy Harbor.

It wasn't that the Church of Earth Mother lacked the will, but there was
a reason holding them back.

This brought Lumian's thoughts back to the valley burning with sulfurous
flames deep in the forest. He believed that the Demon couldn't be slain
under regular circumstances. It could only be sealed and constrained.

As the Church of Earth Mother couldn't achieve this, and Lumian doubted
his ability to do so, enticing the Demon directly would be futile and
perilous.

Lumian's current strategy involved leveraging his fake level and his
allure to evil gods to traverse the forest. During critical moments, he
planned to use the Flog boxing gloves to see if he could converge on the
mysterious valley burning with sulfur flames to investigate the source
of the Demon legends.

___

In the heart of the forest, surrounded by towering trees, Lumian
navigated a path untouched by human presence for years. He moved forward
at a measured pace.

From time to time, he would extract the Flog boxing gloves, relying on
intuition to guide his course. After ten to twenty seconds, he stowed
them away.

After almost an hour, the dense forest unexpectedly cleared.

A menacing brown bear emerged from behind a tree, advancing toward
Lumian with ponderous steps.

"Stop, foreigner!"

The bear's mouth emitted a buzzing human voice.
