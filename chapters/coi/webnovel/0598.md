## Chapter 598: Confrontation and Reconciliation

The night draped the land in darkness, and stars adorned the sky above
Port Santa. The festive crowd had dispersed, leaving behind the remnants
of celebration---discarded litter and the lingering scent of alcohol.

With the official end of the holiday, the city would soon buzz with work
again.

Lumian lingered at the bar until closing time. As he stepped out, the
deserted streets welcomed him, illuminated only by sporadic gas lamps.

The late-night air hinted at the approaching winter's chill. Lumian
breathed it in, feeling the crisp freshness entering his lungs. The
rhythmic crash of waves against the shore added to the night's serenity.

In seemingly high spirits, Lumian, slightly tipsy, walked past the
aftermath of the celebration with hands in his pockets, unnoticed in the
silent surroundings.

He made his way back to the room rented under a false identity.

Upon opening the door, he found Lugano pacing anxiously in the living
room.

"Still up?" Lumian raised an eyebrow.

Lugano, looking like he'd recovered from a serious injury, spoke with a
complex expression,

"An hour ago, Captain Noelia of the combat nuns paid you a visit. Not in
armor, but a stunning dress. She has quite the figure..."

"And then?" Lumian inquired, a smirk on his face.

Lugano replied with envy, "She left disappointed when I told her you
weren't around."

Lumian chuckled, "What's it got to do with you? Why are you still awake
after an hour?"

Lugano coughed awkwardly, "I had a sudden contemplation about my future.
Should I return to Trier and pursue a medical career, or should I opt
for a different path?"

Ignoring the Doctor's musings, Lumian, with a smile, washed up briefly
and retired to his room, succumbing to sleep.

In his dreams, recent events blended into a chaotic tapestry, weaving
stranger and more bizarre stories.

At precisely 6 a.m., Lumian awoke and promptly sat up.

His thoughts sharpened as he recalled the dream. Suddenly, a detail
struck him:

Disregarding the possibility of the Aurora Order having covertly
observed the situation, the crucial aspect of the sea prayer ritual was
Amon's utilization of the altar in Milo Village to discreetly imbue Lie
with a "Steal" ability.

Without this intervention, the opening of the spaceship's energy
passageway would have led to a reversal. Deprived of the sea's power, he
couldn't have ensnared Mad Lady with the authority of the Governor of
the Sea, delaying her until Madam Magician's arrival.

However, Celestial Worthy, positioned at the pinnacle of the Seer,
Apprentice, and Marauder pathways, should possess an in-depth
understanding of Marauder abilities. It seemed unlikely that He hadn't
considered the possibility of an Amon hiding at the altar, granting
"Steal" powers.

It made sense that He hadn't shared this knowledge with April Fool's;
they were expendable tools, and excessive information might weaken their
resolve during the operation. But the overall plan shouldn't have
crumbled due to this.

*Were Celestial Worthy's intentions more intricate than they seemed? Had
He secretly achieved a goal, or did Amon and His unseen ally orchestrate
events in advance?*

*Had Amon truly kept watch over the altar in Milo Village without pause,
last year's sea prayer ritual might not have failed. There remains the
prospect that He wanted to derive amusement from April Fool's
antics.*

*The chaos wrought by April Fool's last year was perhaps understandable.
Shouldn't the most straightforward approach this year involve discreetly
allowing the completion of the Ring of the Sea Queen during the ancestor
honoring ritual? Subsequently, events could unfold with Ultraman
assuming the guise of the incoming Governor of the Sea, only to be
dumbfounded when the sea sacrifice ritual succeeded!*

*Why the convoluted path? What was the purpose behind these seemingly
unnecessary steps?*

*There must be something I'm missing...*

Lumian massaged his temples and rose from the bed.

The revelation didn't surprise him. It would be abnormal if he quickly
unraveled the true motives of every participant in such complex
scenarios involving high-level entities.

Regardless, his goal was accomplished, and the perilous black hole in
the spaceship remained sealed. The rest was not his concern. If he could
decipher it, great. If not, he could always write to Madam Magician to
provide a timely reminder.

After a jog around the still-slumbering Port Santa, Lumian penned a
letter to Madam Magician, detailing his reflections.

As Lumian finished, Lugano, who had been out gathering breakfast for
Ludwig, returned to his quarters.

Taking a moment to contemplate, Lumian handed over 1,000 gold risot to
Lugano. With a composed tone, he stated, "I'll be away for a few days.
Take care of Ludwig. When I return, this commission will be completely
over."

When the time came, Lumian planned on taking a boat to the Southern
Continent. Lumian intended to conspire and make preparations along the
way. His aim was to be ready for the final conspiracy and advance to
Sequence 5 upon reaching his destination in the Southern Continent.

Without prying into his employer's destination, Lugano nervously asked,
"W-will there be any danger in the next few days?"

"It's done," Lumian replied with a smile. "If any other danger arises,
go to the Fertility Order and seek protection. Isn't that what you've
been anticipating?"

Lugano grinned sheepishly, reassured by Lumian's demeanor.

Under the shining sun of Port Santa, with delicious food and passionate
women, staying a few more days seemed like a pleasant prospect!

A two-story relay carriage raced through the village towns scattered
across turquoise pastures, making its way towards the base of the Pyraez
mountain range.

Maintaining his disguise as the adventurer Louis Berry, Lumian occupied
a window seat in the carriage, silently observing the passing scenery.

Each turquoise pasture was adorned with flocks of sheep, resembling
scattered clouds. Shepherds, clad in practical and mobile robes,
strolled amidst the grazing animals.

Some had their own shacks, while others utilized small, wheeled
shepherd's huts for mobility.

Occasionally, local villagers attempted to drive away the incoming
shepherds, only to be met with sly smiles or placated with money and
supplies.

Faced with determined locals, the shepherds, arriving from the mountain
pass, reluctantly moved to more desolate areas, contending with the
watchful eyes of wild wolves and other creatures...

The scenes spoken of by the Cordu shepherds presented themselves vividly
to Lumian, searing a memory in his mind.

Two days later, the relay carriage halted at the foot of the Pyraez
mountain range, pausing in a small town outside the mountain pass.

Lumian changed into a black tweed coat, preparing to venture into the
mountain alone.

As he ascended the mountain ridge, the cold wind intensified, rendering
the wilderness almost devoid of life.

Navigating the sparsely vegetated mountainous terrain, Lumian followed
the trails left by shepherds and merchants. Under the birdless gray sky,
the desolate landscape featured withered trees and a meager stream.
Winter's solitude permeated the air.

In the cold solitude, it took him nearly three days to traverse the
Dariège mountain range and reach the river outside Cordu.

Circling the towering forest, Lumian promptly spotted the blood-colored
pillar, emanating the aura of a mountain peak despite its modest height.

As Lumian gazed, footsteps approached from ahead.

A middle-aged man, clad in a leather coat and clasping his hands
together, appeared.

Trembling in the cold wind, the forest ranger shouted, "Don't go any
further. That village is gone!"

Lumian's eyes moved beyond the ranger to the collapsed and burned
structures in the distance.

After a brief pause, he inquired in a deep voice, "What happened to that
village?"

The forest ranger glanced around and lowered his voice, "They said they
believed in demons. The villagers went crazy, burned down their houses,
and walked into the abyss.

"Look, would a normal village be like this?"

Lumian fell silent for a long time.

Seeing this, the forest ranger sincerely said, "In any case, those old
men instructed me to prevent anyone from entering this village. They
said that it's bad luck; it would provoke the demons."

Lumian remained silent, refraining from further inquiry.

Staring at the unfamiliar yet oddly familiar ruins, he turned away from
the village entrance. Step by step, he approached the nearest alpine
pasture, the wind howling around him.

The grass here had completely withered, blown away by the wind, leaving
behind barren patches of brown soil.

Lumian surveyed the ruins of Cordu, then located a shack abandoned by
the shepherds. Inside, he lay down, closing his eyes and remaining
motionless.

If only everything that had transpired before could be dismissed as a
dream.

When he woke, the alpine pasture was vibrant green once more, birds
returned to the sky, and Ol' Tavern bustled with farmers and herdsmen.
His sister persistently urged him to study, while Reimund, Ava, and the
others pondered uncertain futures, unaware of the life awaiting them...

†

The sun shone brightly, yet the air in Port Santa had begun to carry a
chill.

Abruptly, Lumian stood before Lugano and Ludwig.

"You're finally back!" Lugano exclaimed, relief evident in his voice, as
if he had encountered a savior.

Ludwig's appetite had surged once more, and the 1,000 risot had
disappeared faster than anticipated.

Another week, and Lugano would have to contemplate using his own funds.

He couldn't allow the child to go hungry; he might resort to eating him!

Lumian chuckled in response, saying, "The commission is over. I'll pay
the balance now. Do you want my help to teleport back to Trier, or do
you prefer taking a boat yourself or crossing the Dariège mountain
range?"

Lugano fell silent, seemingly grappling with a decision.
