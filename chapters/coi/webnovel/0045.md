## Chapter 45: Make-up Lesson

Lumian had just confirmed that Michel Garrigue should not have been
implicated by Guillaume Bénet and the others. He planned to visit the
deputy padre late at night, but when he returned home, he heard his
sister say that there was something amiss about him.

Aurore glanced at Lumian and smiled.

"My clueless brother was standing right in front of him when I realized
that something was off about him. Seems like you didn't notice..."

She appeared quite delighted, to the point that she had to raise her
right hand to cover her mouth. After all, her younger brother, who was
clearly ignorant of mysticism, had suddenly become a Beyonder. He had
grasped a wealth of advanced knowledge and discovered that Cordu was
stuck in a time loop. Not only had she been useless as a sister, but she
also found herself outmatched in mysticism knowledge. This made her a
tad unhappy.

Now, she had finally regained her dignity as an elder sister.

Lumian looked at his sister's smile and nodded.

"I didn't see anything unusual in his behavior."

Aurore tersely acknowledged, "His Astral Projection; how can I put it?
Simply put, it's brighter than a normal person's, and he's not a
Beyonder. He hasn't been training his body systematically for a long
time."

"Maybe he was born with a good physique?" Lumian guessed before asking
in puzzlement, "What's an Astral Projection?"

Aurore asked in surprise, "You don't know?"

"No." Lumian shook his head.

Aurore grinned again and said with a hint of disbelief, "That woman
taught you divine paths, the Law of Beyonder Characteristics
Indestructibility, and the acting method, but she didn't tell you basic
concepts like Astral Projection?"

"She was in a hurry, so she only focused on the main points." Lumian
defended the mysterious woman.

Aurore smiled even more happily.

"Perhaps this basic mysticism knowledge is useless to unofficial
Hunters. You just need to track, set traps, and fight."

She struggled to describe her brother's current state. To say he was
ignorant of mysticism wasn't entirely accurate since he knew a great
deal. The things he had learned were all formidable. To say that his
knowledge surpassed most Beyonders wasn't right either; he didn't even
know what an Astral Projection was.

Aurore sighed and said seriously, "I can only complete your mysticism
education. Remember, in mysticism, the external parts of the human body
are divided into four levels. The innermost layer, which is also the
core, is the Soul Body. It's almost equivalent to the concept of a
spirit. It's the spirituality of everything---what gets strengthened.
You could say it's the essence of building a soul.

"To a Mystery Pryer, the potion mainly upgrades the Soul Body.

"The Astral Projection is located outside the Soul Body. It's the
latter's manifestation in the real and spirit worlds. Moreover, it's
closely related to your will and current emotions.

"So, do you understand? When I said the deputy padre's Astral Projection
was brighter than a normal person's, I meant that his Soul Body or
spirit had an issue. This is reflected in his Astral Projection. It has
nothing to do with his natural physique. Of course, it could be because
his spirituality is naturally strong.

"Through the Astral Projection, we can still grasp the target's true
emotions. For example, red signifies passion and excitement. Orange
represents warmth and satisfaction. Yellow indicates happiness and
extroversion. Green conveys calmness and peace. Blue suggests coldness
and introspection. White denotes brightness---an eagerness to improve.
Dark colors symbolize worry, sorrow, and silence. Purple implies that
spirituality is taking control, coldness, and estrangement...

"It's very difficult to fake these colors, but they're relatively
generic. It's impossible for us to distinguish subtle emotions and
delicate feelings."

Lumian listened attentively, as if he wanted to take out a fountain pen
and jot everything down.

"Just listen." Aurore felt a little worn out from talking. She sat down
at the dining table. "I'll give you my first grimoire later. It's filled
with such basic knowledge."

"Alright, alright." Lumian sat down and nodded obediently. "What's
outside the Astral Projection?"

Aurore picked up her carved glass cup and took a sip.

"Beyond that is the Body of Heart and Mind. From this point on, spirit
and flesh merge.

"The Body of Heart and Mind involves the mind. It relates to one's
reasoning, thinking, insight, and ability to understand things. Some
potions mainly improve this, but there are also many spells targeting
it.

"The outermost layer is the Ether Body. It's a manifestation of life
force and physical state, so I can tell at a glance that your body has
improved greatly. Yes, through the thickness, brightness, and color of
different parts of the Ether Body, I can also determine the target's
health. As a Sequence 7 Mystery Pryer, I can even determine the target's
lifespan from the specific situation of the Ether Body.

"As for how to differentiate them, read the notebook later."

Lumian was enlightened.

"The Hunter potion mainly targets the Ether Body?"

"You're wrong. It targets the body and life force, and 'Ether Body' is
the straightforward manifestation of both."

Lumian nodded as he revised, gaining a preliminary understanding of such
mysticism knowledge.

He recalled his sister's words and asked curiously, "Aurore, how did you
observe the deputy padre? Why didn't I sense you nearby?"

Aurore smiled.

"Actually, I've been staying at home all this while, using the Mystery
Pryer pathway's special trait."

"What's special?" Lumian asked with the mentality that it didn't matter
if his sister didn't answer.

Aurore pointed at her eyes.

"The most unique ability of a Mystery Pryer is called the Eyes of
Mystery Prying.

"Although I need to reach a higher Sequence before I can activate the
complete Eyes of Mystery Prying, allowing it to not only be of use to
me, but it can also be placed on the surface of other objects to help me
monitor matters remotely, this doesn't mean that Mystery Pryer's eyes
aren't special before this."

"From Sequence 9 onwards, a Mystery Pryer has seen more than most
Sequence Beyonders of the same pathway. The simplest example is that a
Hunter can only see an Ether Body before they undergo a qualitative
change in their godhood. Furthermore, it's in a less detailed manner.
And now, I can examine the various details of the Astral Projection. In
addition, I can also see things around me that aren't normally visible."

Aurore glanced at the kitchen.

This made Lumian inexplicably shocked.

There was clearly nothing in that direction, but he felt that there
might be something invisible that he could not see!

Aurore continued, "Of course, this might not be a good thing. It's very
easy for something to happen when you see something you shouldn't see.
Therefore, I've been restraining myself. I don't look at things I
shouldn't see, but as my Sequence increases, it's not up to you not to
look."

Lumian thought for a moment and asked in confusion, "Didn't you say that
only higher Sequences can project out the Eyes of Mystery Prying? Why
can you observe the people in the cathedral from home?"

Aurore raised her right hand and pointed with her index finger.

"I've always told you that knowledge equals power, but you didn't
believe me!

"Under normal circumstances, it's true that I can't observe things
hundreds of meters away from home, but humans can use tools, and I have
two 'assistants'."

As she spoke, she took out two items from a hidden pocket in her blue
dress.

One was a brass telescope that could shrink and lengthen, and the other
was a miniature version of a dark ink bottle---this was more like a
child's toy.

"Look, the telescope can help me see people a few hundred meters away
clearly. Once the visual range is closed, I can observe the target's
Astral Projection, Ether Body, and Body of Heart and Mind state," Aurore
introduced with a smile. "This is suitable for open spaces without
obstacles."

Lumian was a little dumbfounded.

*That works too?*

They were clearly discussing mysticism. Why did his sister take out a
telescope?

"What about this?" He pointed at the pocket ink bottle.

Aurore didn't answer. She massaged her temples and opened the bottle
cap.

Lumian suddenly felt a little cold. A cool breeze seemed to blow in
through the window.

"It's a unique spirit world creature," Aurore introduced.

"It? Where is it?" Lumian looked around.

Aurore was rather surprised.

"You still don't know how to activate Spirit Vision? But didn't you say
you saw a lot of undead in the wilderness?"

Lumian had read about the term Spirit Vision in Psychic and knew what it
meant. However, he was completely at a loss as to how to activate Spirit
Vision.

He looked at his sister and slowly shook his head.

"I don't know." Then, he guessed, "Maybe ordinary people can see ghosts
and undead directly when entering the so-called Paramita."

Aurore thought seriously and asked, "So, you don't know Hermes, ancient
Hermes, Elvish, Dragonese, or Jotun?"

"What are those?" Lumian fully displayed what it meant to be illiterate
in the field of mysticism.

Aurore couldn't help but facepalm.

"What exactly did that lady teach you?"

"Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility, law of convergence,
acting method, paths of the divine, Sequence 0, Sealed Artifacts..."
Lumian answered honestly.

"..." Aurore felt like he was flaunting. "I think you want a beating!"

She sighed for a few seconds before regaining her composure.

"Then I'll combine it with my contracted creature to teach you how to
activate Spirit Vision, how to carry out ritualistic magic, and how to
use language with superpowers.

"This is only a rough explanation. If you really want to completely
master it, especially those few languages, it will take at least a year
or two. Of course, this is also a problem with your Sequence pathway.
Hunters probably don't have their learning abilities improved, nor do
they have any enhancements in mysticism. Back then, I relied on
diligence and indoctrination to master all of them in less than half a
year."

Her right hand gently stroked the void in front of her, as if she was
stroking a transparent kitten.

"It's very simple for Beyonders to activate their Spirit Vision, but
it's not completely dark yet. Let's talk about something else first.

"I call it White Paper. It's a very weak spirit world creature. As long
as you have an accurate description, you can hold a ritual and summon it
in your name. Other than the fact that spirit world creatures are
difficult to see, it only has one use. That is to carry a certain
supernatural ability of the contractor, but it can't be too complicated
or too powerful."
