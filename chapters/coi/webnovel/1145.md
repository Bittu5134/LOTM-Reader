## Chapter 1145: Devouring Concepts

"Angel of Devouring? What abilities does it have?" Franca asked Ludwig
casually, treating him as one of their own.

After all, he was like her godchild!

Ludwig, who had yet to break the seal and regain his full intelligence,
answered honestly, "The core ability is to devour the rules of a
specific area and certain shallow-level concepts, though there are
limits to the number and range."

"Devour rules? How does that work?" Franca's curiosity was unmasked.

It sounded pretty powerful.

Before Ludwig could respond, Lumian reverted the scene back to the
protected zone. The surroundings were no longer layered in dark mirrors,
and sunlight once again shone through the windows into the clean, bright
living room.

Ludwig glanced at the sunlight streaming in and the well-lit room before
slowly opening his mouth.

Suddenly, Franca's vision was consumed by darkness; the entire area
became unnaturally black.

For someone like her, who possessed Night Vision, it wasn't an issue.
She turned to look at Ludwig and could still see the boy clearly.

"I thought you swallowed up the entire area, including us, into your
stomach," Franca joked.

Ludwig froze for a moment before explaining, "I could, but at my current
level, I can't directly swallow areas or physical targets. I'd need to
create a vortex in my mouth to pull you all in, and you'd be able to
resist that pull."

"I see..." Franca switched gears and asked, "So what exactly are you
devouring right now?"

"It's the rule of Sunlight Illumination. Even if a Beyonder creates
sunlight again, until this rule is restored, that sunlight won't
function," Ludwig explained earnestly.

Lumian smiled and inquired, "Can you spit out the devoured rule?"

"Once something is devoured, it's gone for good; it can't be restored."
Ludwig opened his mouth again.

The sunlight returned to illuminate the living room.

"Didn't you say it couldn't be restored?" Franca asked, amused.

Ludwig picked up the piece of steak from the ground, stuffed it into his
mouth, and chewed before answering, "It's not that the rule was
restored; I created a new rule similar to the original."

"So devouring a rule allows you to use it yourself?" Franca suddenly
understood.

"Only once," Ludwig admitted. "To use it repeatedly, I'd need to devour
the source power that creates the rule."

Franca had initially wanted to ask how long it would take for a devoured
rule to recover, but her spiritual intuition had already given her the
answer: one to three minutes.

"And how does devouring shallow concepts work?" she asked instead.

Ludwig turned his gaze to the crystal chandelier with its golden frame.
His eyes reflected the object.

He opened his mouth again.

Franca followed his gaze and noticed the chandelier's faint gold frame
turning pitch black and dull, utterly unappealing.

The golden hues of other items in the living room also disappeared,
leaving a void of blackness.

"Did you devour the concept of 'gold'?" Franca clicked her tongue.

Ludwig nodded. "Can the concept of 'gold' recover on its own?" Franca
asked, finding the suddenly drab living room rather unappealing.

"...It depends on how it's devoured. One method allows for recovery,
while the other makes the concept permanently disappear within the
affected range---unless other Beyonder powers intervene," Ludwig
hesitated before answering.

"Which method did you use just now?" Franca suddenly had a bad feeling.

"The second one," Ludwig confessed.

Lumian chuckled and raised his right hand, snapping his fingers.

With a snap, all the golden hues in the living room were restored.

Franca's first reaction was: *You can perform magic and create miracles
now?*

She immediately remembered that this wasn't the World of Ruins, not the
real world. Even Frank Lee's thoughts could affect sailors in their
surroundings, let alone Lumian, who could partially wield the powers of
a Visionary.

"Let me try next time!" she said regretfully.

Lumian turned to Ludwig and asked, "What's the name of Sequence 1? And
what about Sequence 0?"

Ludwig mumbled, "Overall, Sequence 1 is called Chaos Gastric Juices, and
Sequence 0... In the dream city, I saw a term I thought was
fitting---Gluttony. Otherwise, you could call it Self-Devourer or
Tail-Devourer. It means devouring oneself, digesting oneself, and
growing oneself anew."

"Tail-Devourer probably represents a cycle rather than literally
devouring oneself. Let's go with Gluttony or Self-Devourer," Franca
opined.

Lumian chuckled. "Pathways with the prefix 'Primordial' always seem to
have some connection to chaos."

He then said to Ludwig, "You can go back to the kitchen and continue
eating. When the time is right, we'll open the third layer of the Box of
the Great Old Ones."

Ludwig breathed a sigh of relief and left the living room reluctantly.

Franca's gaze returned to the Box of the Great Old Ones before glancing
at Lumian. She opened her mouth but changed her question at the last
moment, "What are the abilities and negative effects of this Grade 0
Sealed Artifact?"

"The first layer swaps the internal space with the target area, rapidly
turning whatever is placed into the box into toys. The second layer
records various scenes and allows the user to add new ones. When opened,
the holder and all living beings within the designated range are
forcibly transported to the specified location.

"The hidden risk of this transportation is randomness. It only works as
intended a small fraction of the time. Most of the time, the destination
changes unpredictably. Furthermore, the good luck given by the
Post-Apocalyptic Scripture can't influence it, or to be more
precise---Sequence 1-level or lower good fortune cannot influence this
randomness accurately.

"As for the third layer, well, you've already heard it." Lumian gave a
brief summary of the Box of the Great Old One's abilities.

Franca was taken aback. "Good luck from anything below Sequence 0 can
hardly influence the randomness?

"Then how did Madam Temperance accurately transport herself and the
Demoness of Black to the Underworld using the blessings of the Angel of
Mercury? Or was it actually Mr. Fool's miracle that made it happen?"

Franca was very interested in her former superior, Demoness of Black
Clarice. During their return to the protected zone, she had briefly
asked Madam Temperance about her fate. The latter had explained in rough
detail through written notes.

She knew that the Demoness of Black had been transported to the
Underworld by the Box of the Great Old Ones and perished there. However,
her dormant mirror remained intact, enabling future resurrection.

Of course, reviving through a dormant mirror was a process that took
time. When the mirror world completely collapsed with the fall of the
Primordial Demoness and the world's mirrors shattered, dormant mirrors
would be hard-pressed to survive---unless placed in locations with
exceptional protection or potent interference.

Based on this, Franca suspected that the Demoness of Black had failed to
resurrect before her dormant mirror was destroyed and was truly dead.

This aligned closely with what Lumian had relayed from Mr. Fool's final
remarks.

Lumian smiled at Franca but offered no explanation.

Franca wanted to press further but closed her mouth instead.

As Lumian sealed the Box of the Great Old Ones, he said to Franca, "Give
me a dormant mirror to keep in my divine kingdom. In the future, as long
as you're not killed by one of a few specific abilities, you'll always
be able to resurrect."

"Alright, I'll fetch one later---or rather, I'll make a new one," Franca
readily agreed. She, of course, didn't carry dormant mirrors on her
person. They were hidden in secret places, like the Nation of the
Evernight. After becoming a Demoness of Catastrophe, she could now
create three more dormant mirrors even before her potion was fully
digested.

Lumian hummed in acknowledgment and stood up.

"Where are you going?" Franca calculated the time and found that his
"occasional" bout of clarity wasn't over yet.

"Helping Mr. Moon digest his potion. I feel like he's about to summon
me," Lumian replied with a smile.

"Sounds like fun," Franca said, her eyes relaxing into a smile.

She pondered for a moment and said, "Once I've made a new dormant
mirror, I'll visit my only subordinate and let her know the Demoness
Sect is finished."

†

Backlund, in the basement of a villa.

In the underground area of a villa, a vibrant tomb surrounded by mutated
grass, flowers, grains, and insects stood tall. Several Sanguine stood
upright before it.

The Moon Emlyn was nearby, setting up a ritual altar.

He felt a little confused about the situation. Originally, he had only
intended to enhance the digestion of his potion by summoning a
high-level existence. To ensure the effect, he planned to have a few
Counts under his command witness the ritual as audience members for
feedback. However, the Sanguine had taken this matter exceptionally
seriously. They had asked him to conduct the summoning in front of the
Round Moon Duke Olmer's coffin and even summoned several younger
marquises to observe.

What was supposed to be a small affair suddenly became solemn and grand.

Although bewildered, Emlyn understood the current situation.

All the existing Dukes of the Sanguine were too old. Their bodies were
failing, and leaving their coffins for prolonged periods was not an
option. Other marquises were either similarly aged and weakened or
lacked sufficient protection from those of higher ranks, making them
vulnerable to losing control during the advancement ritual under the
crimson moon's influence.

Thus, Emlyn had become the Sanguine's hope---the marquis most likely to
ascend to angelhood in recent years. No amount of importance attached to
him was excessive.

*Did I ever tell them who I'm summoning? I think I only mentioned
summoning a high-ranking existence...* The Moon Emlyn pondered
over this trivial matter while arranging the altar.

The upcoming summoning was likely one of the rarest in mysticism
history. He couldn't simply rely on his abilities to create a Door of
Summoning and call it a day. Respect and ceremony were a must.

Of course, this wasn't his first high-level summoning. If the projection
of Gehrman Sparrow he had summoned in the dream city had been complete,
his High Summoner potion would have been fully digested long ago.

Before long, The Moon Emlyn finished preparing the altar. He turned to
the tomb of the Round Moon Duke Olmer and the surrounding Sanguine
marquises and announced, "I'm about to begin the summoning."
