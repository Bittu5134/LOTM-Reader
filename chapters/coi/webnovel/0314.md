## Chapter 314: Crowd-Sourcing

*Did you communicate with your godson and come to me to confirm the
situation?* Lumian maintained his smile.

"What you believe has no bearing on me, as long as you don't subscribe
to an evil god. Furthermore, devotees of the God of Knowledge and Wisdom
are not wanted criminals in Trier."

His implication was clear: *"I'm still a wanted criminal. Believe what
you will."*

Baron Brignais had always been astute. He changed the subject and
continued, "Thank you for aiding me in locating Ludwig. I'm unsure how
to adequately express my gratitude."

He refrained from specifying a thank-you gift, hoping to gauge Lumian's
stance and thoughts.

Lumian pondered briefly before recalling the idea he had set aside.

Getting Baron Brignais to assist with reading and summarizing didn't
necessitate his presence alongside Franca, Jenna, and Anthony Reid. He
could impart some information, clarify what he needed to focus on, and
allow him to return home to peruse and transcribe.

Likewise, before Anthony Reid committed to joining the pursuit of Padre
Guillaume Bénet, direct contact with Jenna and Franca couldn't be
allowed. An isolated "office" could be arranged for him at a later time.

Lumian glanced at Baron Brignais and inquired deliberately, "Are you
proficient in reading and drafting notes?"

Aurore's grimoires had denoted that the pathway under the Church of the
God of Knowledge and Wisdom was labeled Reader. This was also the title
of Sequence 9 potion. Sequence 8 was Student of Ratiocination, and
Sequence 7 was Detective.

Given Baron Brignais rarely exhibited special abilities and mostly
leveraged his exceptional intellect, above-average combat skills, and
sharp marksmanship to lead the Savoie Mob, coupled with his present
faith, Lumian speculated he was a Beyonder of the Reader path.

From the potion's nomenclature alone, one could infer such an individual
excelled in reading.

Baron Brignais drew from his pipe and responded, "In contrast to the
illiterate, my reading and learning aptitude is rather commendable."

He couldn't entirely fathom Ciel's intentions, yet he suspected Ciel was
prying into his Beyonder pathway.

And it wasn't confidential. Gardner Martin had long been privy to this.

Lumian unveiled a genuine smile.

"Lately, I managed to acquire a collection of data regarding creatures
from the spirit world. However, as you're aware---well, you should be,
shouldn't you?---immersing oneself in this kind of knowledge for
extended periods weighs heavily on the mind. Being a Beyonder of the
Hunter path, I won't require this information anytime soon.
Nevertheless, I wish to promptly have access to the relevant knowledge
when necessary, without squandering valuable time. Therefore, I intend
to share a portion of this information with you and kindly seek your
assistance in perusing and extracting the key terms."

"Much akin to constructing an index for a library." Baron Brignais
promptly grasped.

He grinned and remarked, "Truthfully, this would prove advantageous to
me. That knowledge holds considerable value."

*Library index... As anticipated of an adherent of the God of Knowledge
and Wisdom. How professional... *Lumian rejoiced, sensing Baron
Brignais was roughly on par with Anthony Reid combined with a Rabbit of
Knowledge.

Simultaneously, he harbored a cautious sentiment toward Baron Brignais.
For instance, he would furnish this God of Knowledge and Wisdom follower
with ten pages of information. He would peruse them in advance and jot
down notes. Subsequently, he would cross-reference them with the index
submitted by Baron Brignais to discern any deliberate omissions or
alterations.

Of course, this was Lumian's unrefined approach. He could alternatively
beseech Franca to verify via divination, but the potential for
interference still existed.

Lumian slid his hands into his pockets and surveyed Baron Brignais, akin
to an artisan observing a laborer. He beamed and uttered, "I'm
indifferent to who benefits, as long as I accomplish my objective."

Baron Brignais nodded faintly, refraining from further commentary. He
solely apprised Lumian of his whereabouts the following morning and
requested the information to be conveyed there.

Auberge du Coq Doré, Room 305.

Facing Anthony Reid, Lumian eased back and reiterated his words to Baron
Brignais. Concluding, he voiced, "This knowledge serves as your
compensation. Furthermore, I shall impart to you the knowledge of
ritualistic magic. You'll be able to summon a unique spirit world
creature to peruse the information alongside you and distill the
essential points. How does that proposition strike you? Are you inclined
to accept this assignment?"

Anthony Reid's deep brown eyes mirrored Lumian's form as he contemplated
and responded, "You're pressed for time. This matter bears added weight
for you. It carries great significance."

Lumian had no intention of concealing this. He seized the opportunity
and conveyed, "I'm confronted with the need to face a formidable
adversary soon, and I seek to secure a fitting contracted creature. When
the moment arrives, I might extend you an invitation, primarily in a
supportive role. You can consider whether to agree and what form of
compensation you desire. Heh heh, there's no rush for an answer. Think
over it for the next two days."

"You're paving the way for me to be mentally prepared and foster
appropriate expectations." Anthony Reid deciphered Lumian's thoughts.

Instantly, Lumian felt a twinge of embarrassment, but he was never one
to blush easily. He maintained a composed smile and articulated, "Can
you not tell that being honest will put your life in danger?"

Anthony Reid offered a slight nod, affirming certain aspects prior to
committing to aid in perusing the information and crafting the
"summary."

†

On the second floor of Salle de Bal Brise, in the room adjacent to
Lumian's quarters.

Lumian surveyed Anthony Reid and the Rabbit of Knowledge, seated in
tandem, diligently sifting through the information and completing forms.
He subtly nodded in relief.

Once more, he reiterated the caution not to delve deeply into the spirit
world creature knowledge marked as "powerful" and "dangerous." Exiting
the room, he entered the office at the corridor's end.

Franca cozied up in Lumian's armchair, her red-booted feet propped on
the desk's edge.

Baffled and intrigued, she inquired, "What exactly do you need our help
with? Why are you being so mysterious?"

Jenna settled into the chair across from her, turning her body as her
gaze drifted to the door.

Lumian nonchalantly shut the door and recounted the scenario,
elucidating his need to secure a contracted creature prior to
confronting the padre.

"Wouldn't a simple divination suffice?" Franca pondered as she
acquiesced to Lumian's entreaty, while Jenna simmered with curiosity
about the spirit world creatures.

Before long, Franca gazed up at the trio of Rabbits of Knowledge and
Jenna, as well as Lumian, each absorbed in their respective tasks of
poring over documents. Amusement laced her voice as she quipped, "Why
does this feel like a miniature workshop, and we're the toiling
transcribers?"

*Congratulations, your instincts are on point...* Lumian
retorted in jest, "Am I not also perusing the information and completing
forms?"

Franca mulled it over and conceded. She resumed her "labors."

And so, they persisted until well past 10 p.m., punctuating their
efforts with numerous breaks---meals, siestas, catnaps---to mitigate the
strain. Brief reprieves preceded the summoning of the Rabbits of
Knowledge once more.

Intermittently, during his short intervals, Lumian observed Franca,
Jenna, Anthony Reid, and the quartet of Rabbits of Knowledge. He
remained vigilant to prevent them from becoming too engrossed and to
detect any anomalies they might experience.

Jenna reached her threshold first. Having newly ascended to Instigator,
she hadn't fully acclimated to the potion's effects and was grappling
with containing the surge of power. Her state was less than optimal.

Anthony Reid followed suit. His psychological scars ran deep, rendering
him susceptible to certain deviations.

Lumian, Franca, and the seventh set of Rabbits of Knowledge soldiered on
till the end.

Baron Brignais concluded his task around 6 p.m. and delivered the
documents and forms to the café.

After dismissing the summons and seeing off the fatigued "assistants,"
Lumian returned to the safehouse on Rue des Blouses Blanches, arranging
the forms in a neat stack.

Perusing the papers briefly, he confirmed the general state of affairs.
A sense of accomplishment swelled within him as he casually tossed the
forms onto the table.

The immediate selection wasn't on his agenda. His plan was to first
establish a Contractee status and sort out the specifics of the
contract. Only afterward would he consult the index, thereby preventing
the likelihood of stumbling upon a spirit world creature that matched
his criteria in all respects but failed to meet the contract
stipulations.

Lumian rested for a spell before summoning a Rabbit of Knowledge and
tasking it with duplicating two more forms.

Storing the three indices separately, Lumian's weariness was palpable.
The prospect of cleansing himself seemed distant as he tumbled onto the
bed and surrendered to sleep.

†

At 6 a.m., Lumian brimmed with vigor, showing no haste to descend
underground, arrange an altar, and beseech for a boon. Instead, he
engaged in his usual regimen: jogging, practicing boxing, and
cultivating his mental equilibrium.

By nearly 8 a.m., he stood before the doorway to Room 207 at Auberge du
Coq Doré, ingredients at the ready.

After a brief internal debate, Lumian ultimately seized the carbide
lamp---although he no longer required specialized illumination
equipment; he was, in essence, a paragon of such abilities.

His aspiration rested on his foes' initial assumption that he lacked
night vision and was inept at generating light.

In Underground Trier, within the quarry cavern that had once borne
witness to Inevitability-linked rituals on several occasions.

Lumian briefly tidied the dank, lightless setting, positioning a
blood-infused candle upon the altar stone.

Just as he concluded the sanctification of the ritual silver dagger and
readied to cast a spiritual barrier, faint footfalls reached his ears.

The sounds reverberated within the subterranean passage, seemingly not
distant from the present mine.

*Someone is passing by?* Lumian's pulse quickened, his intent
fixated on swiftly restoring the area to order and concealing himself.

Yet, as he neared the altar before him and before he could extinguish
the carbide lamp, soft footsteps drew close, manifesting at the cave
entrance.

Aware that concealment was futile, Lumian promptly swiveled around, one
hand nestled in his pocket, his gaze converging on the source of the
sound.

A slender man of brownish-black complexion stood there, clutching a
carbide lamp. His black hair bore a slight curl, and his eyes held a
profound allure. He sported a black seer's cloak reminiscent of those
seen in a circus.

*Monette...* Lumian recognized the figure.

He was an Islander swindler who had duped Charlie and been hoodwinked by
the con artists in Salle de Bal Unique.

Monette, too, saw Lumian.

A smirk tugged at the corners of his lips as he greeted with palpable
cheer, "What a coincidence."

In tandem with his words, the swindler produced a crystalline monocle,
inserting it into his right eye socket.
