## Chapter 1164: Know Thy Enemy

When vast clusters of suns exploded, tearing apart planets and pulling
all matter toward themselves, a pervasive grayish-white fog appeared.
Within it stood Klein, wearing a half silk top hat and a long black
trench coat, his figure slightly distorted as he faced Supernova
Dominator, one of the Great Old Dominators.

At the same time, Klein sensed an almost untouchable shadow emerging
from a higher dimension. He scrutinized the Spirit Body Threads,
preparing to interfere, manipulate, influence, and disrupt them.

High-Dimensional Overseer!

This was a Great Old Dominator capable of countering abilities such as
Parasitism, Marionettes, and Blink. He wielded the corresponding symbol:

Dimensionality!

From higher or lower dimensions, Spirit Body Threads were tangible and
real---something that could be touched. Blink only allowed movement on a
small scale, while those Parasitized were bound together into one
entity.

This rendered the unique, ubiquitous nature of the Lord of Mysteries'
avatars ineffective. Combat against the High-Dimensional Overseer could
only rely on Klein's true body.

Thus, as long as the battlefield contained the High-Dimensional
Overseer, Klein could only leverage Pillar symbolisms while contending
with one additional Great Old Dominator.

However, in a one-on-one situation, the Dimensionality symbolism of the
High-Dimensional Overseer did not completely suppress the Lord of
Mysteries' Change symbolism, which included space-time. These forces
mutually counteracted each other. Just as the King of Space-Time could
hinder the Lord of Dimensions from freely traversing dimensions,

Klein could rely on symbolism like Foolishness to turn the tide against
the High-Dimensional Overseer. Klein couldn't truly kill Him but could
defeat Him, banish Him, and make Him suffer significant losses.

Apart from the High-Dimensional Overseer, three other entities could
disrupt the Lord of Mysteries' ability to manifest in countless forms
and fight multiple foes simultaneously: Monarch of Decay,
Inextinguishable Ravings, and Primordial Hunger.

The Monarch of Decay's symbols of Decay and Certain Death made it so
that the death of an avatar equaled the death of the main body, and the
decay of an afterimage equaled the decay of the main body.

Inextinguishable Ravings seemed to share His origin with the residual
psyche of the Original Creator within the Beyonder characteristics. It
was the source of all ravings, capable of ignoring the interference of
marionettes, avatars, and afterimages to directly project His voice into
sefirot and Uniquenesses, transmitting His madness and implanting His
intent. Moreover, He did not have a true physical form but attached
Himself to certain objects, causing them to exhibit specific colors or
appearances.

Primordial Hunger symbolized the instinct of Convergence. Through this
mechanism, He could forcibly pull Klein's true body to His side.
Furthermore, if He devoured an avatar or marionette, He could absorb and
erase the corresponding abilities, reducing or even temporarily
nullifying their symbolic influence.

Without these four Great Old Dominators, Lord of Mysteries Klein would
undoubtedly be able to hold off the remaining four on his own. While he
might not secure a decisive victory, he would certainly not lose or
allow Them to disrupt other battlefields significantly.

If the Mother Tree of Desire were still complete, as the Source of
Curses, She would have been fully capable of cursing avatars and
marionettes to indirectly curse the true body. Unfortunately, She has
currently lost that aspect of symbolism. The uniqueness of the Chained
and two of Her Abomination Beyonder characteristics were still sealed by
Klein, and the Tenebrous World resisted Her influence.

A more reality-oriented Great Old Dominator like Supernova Dominator
could rely on symbols and concepts like Density, Gravity, and Attraction
to influence space-time and distort dimensions. However, for the Lord of
Mysteries, who controlled change and could turn falsehood into truth or
truth into falsehood, mere indirect interference was sufficient to stall
Him without engaging directly.

The Circle of Inevitability wielded symbols of Past, Present, Future,
Cycle, and Destiny, which theoretically could impact avatars,
marionettes, and the ability to blink. However, it was effectively
countered by Klein's combination of the concepts of King of Space-Time,
Beacon of Destiny, and Error. If the Lord of Mysteries lacked any of
these targeted concepts, the Circle of Inevitability would have had a
chance to reverse the suppression or even gain the upper hand. But Klein
had all three: the King of Space-Time countered Past, Present, and
Future and Beacon of Destiny countered Cycle; and Error countered
Destiny.

The Goddess of Fate's symbolisms primarily centered on the domain of
fate, particularly conscious manipulation, which made Her an appealing
opponent for the Beacon of Destiny's Foolishness symbolism. As for Her
other significant symbolism, Eternal Life, Klein had no intention of
actually killing Her, so it posed no major concern.

Based on prior intelligence gathering, divinations, and prophecies,
Klein has long understood which entities to intercept and which to
redirect elsewhere. His hope was to hold off three to four Great Old
Dominators on his own, creating opportunities for breakthroughs on other
battlefields.

How should one guide the unwanted Great Old Dominators to other places
while keeping those intended for containment? Beyond employing Fooling
and Deceit, one must also have a general understanding of the goals of
these Great Old Dominators.

This was one of the preparations Klein had made over the past month.

The High-Dimensional Overseer desired sefirot related to rules, order,
and space-time. Through divination and prophecy, Klein deduced that He
sought either the Nation of Disorder or the River of Eternal Darkness.
If the Great Old Dominators concentrated Their efforts to press the Lord
of Mysteries back into His coffin, the High-Dimensional Overseer would
also likely seek to accommodate the Uniquenesses of the Door and Error
pathways and take control of Sefirah Castle.

Inextinguishable Ravings was highly likely to covet the Knowledge Moor
and aimed to control the Chaos Sea, accommodating the Uniquenesses of
The Hanged Man, White Tower, and Visionary pathways.

Primordial Hunger would not miss any opportunities related to chaos or
primordial qualities. His objective appeared to be consuming the City of
Calamity, ingesting but not digesting the Chaos Sea, and absorbing the
Uniquenesses of The Hanged Man pathway and others. However, Klein
suspected that Primordial Hunger might lose control over His convergence
instinct and directly swallow the Chaos Sea. If this occurred, the
situation would become even more complex and troublesome.

The Monarch of Decay was relatively easy to deduce---His goals were
either the City of Calamity or the River of Eternal Darkness, though He
could only choose one.

The Mother Tree of Desire would prioritize reclaiming the Tenebrous
World and its corresponding Uniqueness and Sequence 1 Beyonder
characteristics. This was an instinctual drive of Her godhood.

The Circle of Inevitability undoubtedly coveted the Key of Light the
most. However, the City of Calamity and the River of Eternal Darkness
were also within His scope, as these pathways symbolized destined
conclusions and various calamities. Additionally, similar to the
High-Dimensional Overseer, if the Lord of Mysteries were defeated in a
joint effort, the Circle of Inevitability would not shy away from
seizing control of Sefirah Castle and accommodating the Uniquenesses of
The Fool and Error pathways.

Supernova Dominator's goals were harder to pinpoint. Klein speculated
that He desired the City of Calamity to embody the symbolism of
Universal Catastrophe, the Knowledge Moor to enrich His star systems and
civilizations, and the Nation of Disorder to complete the order and
rules beyond celestial mechanics. Furthermore, He was likely interested
in the Chaos Sea and the Uniquenesses of the Sun and Storm pathways.

The Goddess of Fate similarly prioritized the Key of Light. However, if
Sefirah Castle was left vacant, Her goals would align with the Circle of
Inevitability. As for the Chaos Sea and the associated Uniquenesses of
the White Tower and Visionary pathways, Klein felt there was a certain
probability of Her interest.

Having roughly understood these intentions, Klein already had a plan for
what to do next.

First, he did not Graft the Western Continent's Buddhist Kingdom or the
Tenebrous World to somewhere near him. Instead, he proactively detached
himself from the astral world.

Suddenly, at an infinite height overlooking the entire world, Lord of
Mysteries Klein, wearing black gloves, a dark trench coat, and holding a
star-encrusted cane, appeared. He was extraordinarily immense, towering
over all creation. Raising his right hand, he snapped his fingers with a
sharp crack.

With this motion, grayish-white fog immediately enveloped the spirit
world, covering the entire universe's spirit world.

Supernova Dominator, High-Dimensional Overseer, and other Great Old
Dominators instantly lost Their connection to the spirit world and could
no longer exert any influence over it.

The Lord of Mysteries---the Dominator of the Spirit World!

This was a direct utilization of Pillar symbolism!

From that moment on, for a set period, no creature could enter the
spirit world without Klein's explicit permission.

All their abilities, authorities, and symbols related to the spirit
world were rendered ineffective!

The three Pillars differed significantly in how They wielded Their
respective symbols. For example, the Mother Goddess of Depravity, as the
Dominator of Reality, could not seal off reality to prevent unauthorized
entry or expel all adversaries. Such actions were unachievable. She
could only impose a continuous weakening effect on targets within
reality. However, on the other hand, reality was the foundation of the
universe. Unless everything ended, reality would eternally exist. Thus,
the Mother Goddess of Depravity possessed the characteristic of
indestructibility, never to perish. As long as She wished, She could not
be displaced or sealed.

While the Lord of Mysteries sealed the spirit world, Lumian, with three
heads and six arms, waited for his target to appear.

Since he was not yet dead or collapsing, it was time to execute the next
phase of the plan.

The plan was: to take the initiative and devour a Great Old Dominator!

If the Great Old Dominators could absorb another sefirah to approach
Pillar status, so could he, the Origins of Disaster, Calamity of
Destruction!

*Do you Great Old Ones lack sefirot within yourselves? Whatever you can
do, I can do too!*

*As for the indestructibility of your psyche or the potential
consequences of devouring you---I'm already dying, so why should I
care?*

Lumian had long identified his target for this purpose and made
preparations in advance.

For example, he had reinstated the title of Malady God within his Sick
Church.

Previously, the Malady God referred to the Monarch of Decay.
