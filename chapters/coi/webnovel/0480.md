## Chapter 480: Ascetic

Amidst the frenzied and terrifying roars, a hurricane tore through the
abnormally chaotic weather, shrouding the scene in smoke, flames,
lightning, and hail. It spiraled into the sky, merging with the silent
inferno.

Not far from the apocalypse-like hurricane, two figures felt the impact
of the roar simultaneously. One's head tilted back slightly, as if
punched, while the other's wrinkles quivered, and his eyes grew sharper.

The former was the man who had originally stood behind Olson, vice
president of the Iron and Blood Cross Order, Tony Twain. The latter was
aged, donning a blue military suit with a sash and medals. His neatly
combed back dark-red hair identified him as the mysterious president of
the Iron and Blood Cross Order, known as Diest.

Diest shifted his gaze from the hurricane to Tony Twain.

"The chance to become a Conqueror is before us. If I can seize it, I'll
find a way to separate the Weather Warlock's Beyonder characteristic and
bestow it upon you."

As Tony Twain observed the violent hurricane, lightning, and torrential
rain, his light-blue eyes hinted at mockery.

"Can we really succeed? A Weather Warlock has already joined. Even if
Vermonda Sauron loses control and transforms into a monster, he's still
a Sequence 1 monster."

Tony Twain's words showed no respect for a Sequence 2 Weather Warlock or
a Sequence 1 Conqueror, despite not being an Angel yet.

Diest's expression remained unchanged, and his aura surged.

With his military attire, he resembled the commander-in-chief of all
armies.

"Elsewhere, we'll surely fail. Even without interference, we'll need to
embark on a lengthy hunt to stand a chance against the out-of-control
Vermonda Sauron. But here..." Diest spoke in a deep voice, "We can
harness that power for a brief period."

As he finished speaking, the area between his brows turned red, as if
something sought to emerge.

Simultaneously, Diest retrieved a coin pouch from his waist, concealed
beneath his suit.

Filled with soybeans and a few palm-sized iron soldiers, Diest grabbed
them and tossed them forward.

Amidst the howling wind, the iron soldiers sprang to life and expanded.
The soybeans swelled rapidly, transforming into giants with blurred
faces and yellowish skin, as if soaked in water.

Failing to bring his team here in time, Diest abruptly transformed into
a blazing dark-red, nearly purple flame, engulfing the newly created
soldiers.

A beam of light shot up, tearing through the sky and homing in on the
giant figure within the hurricane.

At the edge of the magnificent city veiled in a thin gray fog, Gardner
Martin removed his helmet. His breastplate bore web-like cracks,
revealing blood-stained clothes beneath.

With one hand pressed against his head, he staggered forward,
intermittently emitting crimson flames bordering on white.

The terrifying roar had clearly taken its toll.

Navigating through the ruins, Gardner Martin quickly approached the thin
gray fog. Half-collapsed asymmetrical buildings stood within, seemingly
frozen in time, struck by a devastating blow and sunk into the ground.

Abruptly halting, Gardner Martin glanced to the side and asked in a deep
voice, "Who is it?"

Amidst the sound of gravel tumbling, Olson, resembling a hungry bear,
emerged from behind a collapsed black building, carrying a small brown
suitcase.

The Supervisor, sporting a half top hat, yellow vest, and black suit,
looked at Gardner Martin and said, "I didn't know who was coming, so I
hid for a while. Where's Philip?"

Gardner Martin breathed a sigh of relief and replied, "We encountered
Lumian Lee and his team. They killed Philip. I was injured and barely
managed to escape."

Olson, with his thick beard, didn't delve into the details of the battle
and sized up Gardner Martin. "You're quite beaten up."

Gardner Martin chuckled, saying,

"Fortunately, I had Pride Armor to shield me from most of the damage.
Yeah, I blame it mainly on the angelic roar; it affected me to a certain
extent. Fortunately, I was relatively far away, so the problem isn't
that serious. Look, even the Pride Armor hasn't attacked me, indicating
that I haven't weakened."

"That's good. Let's enter Fourth Epoch Trier now," Supervisor Olson
nodded with an indifferent expression.

Gardner Martin turned around, clutching the silver helmet with one arm,
and walked towards the thin gray fog not far away.

Olson carried a small brown suitcase and trailed behind the Commanding
Officer of the Iron and Blood Cross Order.

As the two advanced, Olson's eyes suddenly turned fierce and vicious.

*You'd used 'fortunately' twice... You've already taken off the Pride
Armor's helmet...* Olson muttered silently to himself, his
brownish-red eyes reflecting Gardner Martin's staggering figure in the
silver armor.

At the edge of the wilderness, scattered with mirror fragments, Franca
and Jenna couldn't hear the chants emanating from the wall of
spirituality, but they observed the grayish-white stone pillar and two
candles of the same color mysteriously softening. Fist-sized candle
flames flickered in silver-white and black, while an illusory
pewter-black liquid oozed from Lumian's chest, enveloping him.

As Lumian curled up on the ground, occasionally rolling, Franca sighed
softly and remarked, "It looks painful..."

This likely marked Ciel's fourth encounter with such an ordeal.

"That's right." Despite standing outside the wall of spirituality, Jenna
felt an inexplicable fear, goosebumps forming on her skin.

While she had witnessed Ciel's mental pain and confusion, this was her
first time witnessing such intense physical suffering.

Franca spoke sincerely, "If Ciel were to switch to the Affliction potion
now, he wouldn't have to worry about not reaching Sequence 4. It's too
compatible!"

Sequence 5 of the Assassin pathway was known as Affliction or the
Demoness of Affliction.

After another terrifying roar, the silver-black illusory liquid beads on
Lumian's body seeped into him. His expression gradually relaxed, and his
body ceased its curled-up state.

He lay sprawled beside the collapsed grayish-white stone pillar,
reluctant to move for a few seconds.

While his spirituality had recovered and even increased, his body and
mind were visibly exhausted. It was akin to the sensation one
experienced after completing an exceptionally challenging task in their
most focused state.

Lumian, aware of the urgency, forced himself to his feet.

He noticed that the silver-black candle flame had returned to normal,
and the surrounding gray fog was gradually dissipating.

His plan to rely on the gray fog's protection against the terrifying
roar had failed before implementation.

Mr. Fool's response had a time limit!

Furthermore, he had to consider the interference of the Celestial Worthy
of Heaven and Earth for Blessings.

As Lumian swiftly tidied up the altar, he scrutinized his
transformation:

The improvement in spirituality was evident with the Ascetic boon.
Lumian believed that even after using the Spell of Harrumph a few times,
he could complete nearly eight Spirit World Traversals.

Ascetic had also enhanced his endurance, making him more adaptable to
extreme weather. Even if he encountered frost, he wouldn't be frozen.
Similarly, he found himself better at enduring emotions and desires.
While he still felt them, he could endure many things.

This extended to an Ascetic's core ability, Compression. It could be
used for the mind and also produced positive effects in the physical and
mystic domains.

The former involved emotions and desires, which were mostly tolerated.
They didn't completely disappear but were suppressed. At critical
points, they needed to be vented or relieved, or psychological problems
could arise. The Compression ability could accumulate these emotions and
desires and erupt at critical moments for the desired effect. For
Lumian, the negative effects of the Contractee's three abilities and the
corresponding effects of mystical items on him were more bearable.
However, he needed to regularly break an enemy's neck as a way to vent.

The latter aspect referred to spirituality, strength, and ritual steps.
Through Compression, Lumian could compress and store spirituality and
strength beyond the average person when he had nothing to do, releasing
them when needed. This allowed his spirituality to recover once and
temporarily enlarge him. His strength, speed, and agility were
sufficient to withstand a Sequence 6 Dawn Paladin of the Warrior pathway
for a minute or two. Additionally, the accumulation of ritual steps
enabled Lumian to use abilities like the Animal Creation Spell and the
Exorcism Spell in actual combat.

Furthermore, after becoming an Ascetic, Lumian's previous boons had been
enhanced. For instance, the number of contract abilities he could
withstand had increased to three, although he didn't want to maximize
them. He preferred choosing one or two suitable ones, as too many
contracts brought too many negative effects. Even Ascetics would suffer
because of them, as evidenced by negative examples like Guillaume Bénet
and Bouvard.

Of course, this wasn't an immediate concern, as summoning creatures from
the spirit world was impossible in this location.

Lumian swiftly stashed away the items and dispelled the wall of
spirituality. Handing back the fortunate gold coin to Jenna, he spoke in
a low, commanding tone, "Let's make our way to Fourth Epoch Trier."

"Huh?" Jenna was bewildered.

Ciel had warned them to steer clear of the giant and the grand city!

Franca looked back with contemplation and said, "Do you suspect that the
fog shrouding the city belongs to Mr. Fool? Entering might provide some
protection. We won't have to worry about getting taken out by that
lunatic's roar or succumbing to the risk of transforming into a
monster?"

"Yes, it's dangerous, but there's a chance for us to defend ourselves
and await further developments." Lumian inferred that the same fog
enshrouded Fourth Epoch Trier, drawing from the fog around the Samaritan
Women's Spring and the lingering shadows of significant figures from the
Fourth Epoch.

It emanated from Mr. Fool's powers!

Franca wasted no time and nodded decisively. "Okay."

Jenna chose to trust her two companions without delving into questions.

At that moment, Anthony Reid had finished clearing the battlefield and
approached with the spoils.
