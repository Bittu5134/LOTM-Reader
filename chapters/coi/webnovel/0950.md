## Chapter 950: Dinner Invitation

*It's really Mushu Hospital...* Lumian wasn't surprised at all
by Xu Xinyang's answer.

He grunted in acknowledgment. "Alright, Team Lead."

He had thought about it. As an important base for evil gods to influence
the dream city, and with some degree of cooperation with the Celestial
Worthy, Mushu Hospital might be unavoidable for many things to come. It
wasn't a matter of cautiously avoiding it or not entering, pretending it
didn't exist.

So, rather than that, why not take advantage of the daytime, while their
actions hadn't yet reached a critical stage, while he still had another
chance to enter, and while he had a reasonable and legitimate excuse, to
go take a look and investigate in person. Of course, the underground
floors that likely represented the Abyss and Mr. Fool's psychological
dark side still couldn't be recklessly entered.

After seeing off Xu Xinyang, Lumian stayed in the surveillance room
until almost noon. He and his shift partner Old Xia waited for their
colleagues to relieve them, then went downstairs together to the Intis
Group staff cafeteria located in the annex building of the Tech Building
for lunch.

They didn't get meal allowances, and the cafeteria wasn't free, but it
had a wide variety of dishes, and the prices were kept quite cheap
through company subsidies. So, whether from headquarters or branch
offices, employees in this building all liked eating in the cafeteria.
Even Mr. Huang himself would come eat there occasionally to check the
quality of the food.

The only problem was that during the lunch rush, the cafeteria was
packed. Higher-income employees preferred to order takeout or dine at
nearby malls.

As security guards, when they could go to the cafeteria depended on when
their colleagues came to relieve them. Everyone tacitly agreed to come a
bit earlier to avoid the peak hours.

Lumian got steamed eggs with minced meat, stir-fried yellow chives and
meat with pickled peppers, fried chicken leg, cucumber and pork soup,
and a big bowl of rice. He found a corner spot with Old Xia and listened
to him chat about the antics of the Aurora Company folks while eating.

Old Xia clicked his tongue and said, "Their boss is an exhibitionist, or
the M in S&M, often with whip marks on his body..."

*Say more, slander some more, I love hearing it...* Lumian
nodded along while inwardly muttering.

Suddenly, his phone vibrated twice.

He picked it up and saw a message from "A name that leaves a deep
impression on you", which was Anderson Hood: "Is that friend you
mentioned actually yourself?"

Lumian smiled and replied using voice input: "You could interpret it
that way."

He felt that in conversations between Hunters, whoever got anxious
first, whoever got angry first, whoever felt guilty first, would lose.

Only by adjusting oneself to a state where nothing mattered could one
stand undefeated.

After about 20-30 seconds, Anderson replied: "Painting requires talent,
I hope you have it.

"Our tutoring school doesn't have painting classes, but I know a decent
studio, that's where I learned. If you're interested, tomorrow night at
7, meet me at the entrance of Jinxiu Dongfang Community on Sifang
Street, and I'll take you for a tour."

*At night?* Lumian pondered for a moment before replying:
"Alright, thank you."

He remembered that Colorful Hostel was on Sifang Street, but the
interior renovation and decoration hadn't been completed yet.

In the Administrative Department, large office.

Luo Shan stretched lazily, walked over to Franca's desk, and asked with
a smile, "What are you eating for lunch? I don't want to join the crowd
at the cafeteria."

Without waiting for Franca to respond, she lowered her voice and said,
"Other departments all find time to have team dinners to welcome new
employees, only our Administrative Department doesn't.

"Mainly because those ladies don't want to or think little of us, which
is fine, but the worry is that they'll insist on going, wanting to find
some free helpers. Tsk, can you imagine how that would develop? Sarcasm
and veiled barbs are the norm, with people crying, arguing, or even
wanting to get physical not being uncommon. It left a bunch of trouble
to deal with afterward, so Old Zhang simply stopped organizing
departmental dinners. Those who get along well just gather privately,
however they want."

Franca listened with relish and said expectantly, "I wonder when Mr.
Huang will next come to the Administrative Department."

The scene then would surely be spectacular; she wanted to witness it.

Demonesses inevitably tended to have a bit of a chaos-loving
inclination, which was very justifiable when it came to watching drama.

"Mr. Huang probably won't come in the next few days. He has VIPs to
entertain, and even if he comes to the company, he'll go to the 16th
floor," Luo Shan disclosed Mr. Huang's whereabouts.

*Zaratulstra? *Franca was very attentive and serious about this
matter.

Besides the items listed in the action outline, they also had to guard
against the Celestial Worthy and evil gods doing bad things to Zhou
Mingrui in the dream city. They needed to discover and prevent it early.

Moreover, this could also accumulate inspiration to help them formulate
an awakening plan---how the Celestial Worthy's subordinates did it, and
they could try to do the opposite.

"What a pity," Franca said with a look of regret.

She then asked curiously, "Won't Mr. Huang bring the VIP to tour the
company?"

"He has before," Luo Shan suddenly paused, her voice becoming even
lower, "That day Zhou Mingrui happened to be on sick leave. Franca,
could that long-named VIP be the destroyer you mentioned, sent from the
future to the present by evil forces? Was Zhou Mingrui's sick leave
arranged by your people?"

*A Painter's spiritual intuition is quite strong...* Franca
smiled and said, "Is that VIP called Zaratulstra?"

Luo Shan nodded solemnly.

"Then it is," Franca confirmed her earlier guess.

Luo Shan was silent for a few seconds, then her eyes lit up and she
said,

"Why don't I ask Zhou Mingrui to have dinner with us? That way you'll
have a chance to meet and chat with him."

*Holy crap... So fast? So direct?* Franca felt a bit shocked.

She had thought it would take her and Lumian a week or two to naturally
contact Zhou Mingrui through work matters before reaching a point where
they could add each other on WeChat or have casual chats.

Who knew that on her first day of work, Luo Shan would invite Zhou
Mingrui to have dinner together!

*It's too, too fast...*

*This progress is too advanced; I'm not ready yet...*

Seeing that Franca hadn't answered, Luo Shan smiled and said, "Zhou
Mingrui owes me several meals. Every time he asks me for information, he
says he'll treat me to a meal next time, but so far he's only done it
once.

"Hmm, welcoming my bestie to the company is a good reason."

As she spoke, she picked up her phone and started tapping out a message
to Zhou Mingrui.

After a while, Luo Shan waved her phone and said, "He agreed, but said
it would be dinner tomorrow, because he has to work overtime tonight,
and tech people have too little lunch break time to go eat something
nice."

*He agreed just like that... No stress reaction, no excuses?*
Franca suddenly recalled an old saying: *The best way to get close to
someone is to know the people around them.*

*Helping Luo Shan was indeed the right choice... This is karma rewarding
kindness!* Franca pondered for a moment, then said to Luo Shan,
"Zhou Mingrui seemed a bit concerned about those paintings you had on
your desk before. He didn't refuse your invitation, but agreed to it.
Maybe he also wants to confirm or probe something..."

Without waiting for Luo Shan to respond, Franca added, "If that's really
the case, it's a good thing."

*The only question is, does dinner count as nighttime?*

*This goes against the plan in the action outline, and could lead to
confusion and ambiguity in the experimental results...*

*It shouldn't count if it's not completely dark, right?*

†

At 4:30 in the afternoon, after another round of patrolling the floors,
Lumian and Old Xia came to the underground parking lot of the Tech
Building. They saw Team Lead Xu Xinyang sitting in a dark gray SUV,
reaching out from the passenger seat and waving at them.

"Over here."

Lumian and Old Xia walked over and sat in the spacious back seat.

"Just us few?" Old Xia looked out the window.

Xu Xinyang laughed.

"Who goes to visit patients at a hospital in a big group? The nurses
wouldn't let us in!

"Just the four of us, Zhao is driving, the others will wait directly at
the dinner place."

Zhao was the young man sitting in the driver's seat, looking a bit
chubby from the side.

At this time, the roads were still fairly clear. Before 5 o'clock,
Lumian and the others had arrived outside Mushu Hospital.

Two young men each carrying a box of fruit and a bag of nutritional
supplements followed behind Xu Xinyang and Old Xia as they walked in.

The lobby of Mushu Hospital was no different from when Lumian last came,
ordinary, with people coming and going. Only occasionally could one
notice certain orderlies with indifferent gazes and slightly mechanical
movements.

Lumian withdrew his gaze, confirming that his spirituality gave no
warning and there were no abnormalities around, then entered the
elevator going up and arrived on the 12th floor.

Exiting the elevator area and turning into the ward, after pushing open
the door, what met his eyes was a quiet nurses' station and a corridor
extending into darkness.

The light at the end of the corridor seemed to be broken, not yet
repaired.

Led by a nurse who looked very normal, they entered a double patient
room where Old Wang and Old Ding were.

Before Lumian, Zhao, and Old Xia could get a clear look at the patients'
condition, two bedside family members rushed in front of Xu Xinyang,
speaking one after another:

"Team Lead Xu, this is definitely a work-related injury for our Old
Wang!"

"Boohoo, Team Lead Xu, our Old Ding almost died, look at him, look at
him, who knows how long it will take to recover."

"..."

Xu Xinyang finally found an opportunity and pressed his right hand down.

"Ladies, this will definitely count as a work injury. Mr. Huang said
that not only will there be compensation according to national
standards, but the company will also give an additional sum, as well as
cover all medical expenses beyond insurance, and continue to pay normal
wages until Old Wang and Old Ding fully recover and can return to work.
We won't let one of us bleed, sweat, and cry!"

While Xu Xinyang was comforting the family members, Lumian and the
others turned their gaze to the hospital beds, seeing the two patients
wrapped from head to toe in white bandages, with only their eyes, noses,
and mouths exposed.

Old Xia couldn't help but lean close to Lumian and say in a low voice,
"I don't mean to be unkind, but they really look funny like this. I
thought only TV shows wrapped people up like this. Didn't expect to see
it in real life too."

Lumian didn't respond to Old Xia, because he thought of mummies.

Mummies that were said to have close connections with the Wraith pathway
controlled by the Mother Tree of Desire.

And this was Mushu Hospital.
