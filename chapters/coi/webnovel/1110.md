## Chapter 1110: Prince and Princess

That moment, Jenna felt hesitation, trepidation, fear, anger,
resentment, with many words surging to be spoken, as if to convince
herself, but after thousands and ten thousands of words rushed to her
lips, only one sentence remained: "But, I am willing."

All those emotions ultimately condensed into a smile.

Amon, for reasons unknown and to no one in particular, shook His head,
lowering His gaze to the white paper in His hand.

"Celia Bello, who chooses to become a Demoness of Unaging, will receive
Amon's help. And Amon, taking advantage of the moment when the Demoness
Sect's top leaders are all dispatched, stole a Grade 1 Sealed Artifact
corresponding to a Demoness of Unaging, and thus arrived a bit late.

"As for the corresponding supplementary ingredients, the Visionary has
long envisioned them into existence."

As He spoke, the white paper floated downward, and a potion that had
been prepared at some unknown time appeared in Amon's hand.

The potion dyed its container a grayish-white color, clearly reflecting
the mirror world around it.

It flew toward Jenna, landing in her palm.

Seeing this potion, numerous images suddenly flashed through Jenna's
mind: her childhood falling asleep to her mother's humming, the
excitement of first entering the Théâtre de l'Ancienne Cage à Pigeons to
learn performance, the bitterness of struggling to survive with her
mother and brother, the shock and gratitude of first meeting Franca, the
series of events after encountering Lumian, the massive impact and
disillusionment of watching her mother jump to her death from the sixth
floor...

These countless fragments quickly settled, ultimately freezing into two
scenes: one scene was after she finished singing a song at the Salle de
Gristmill, facing whistles and cheers, walking proudly to Lumian like a
princess, laughing as she issued an invitation: "Handsome lion, dance!"

The other scene was when she inserted the long-handled silver fork into
Hugues Artois's eye socket, piercing into his brain, with the frozen
surprise, bewilderment, and fear on the Member of Parliament's face
illuminated by the surrounding light.

Jenna raised the potion bottle, holding it like a long-handled silver
fork.

This time, the "long-handled silver fork" would pierce her own face.

Jenna suddenly thought of something, turning her head to look at Anthony
and Ludwig.

The latter seemed to want to stop her but was held back by the former.

Jenna opened her mouth, wanting to leave a word or two for Franca
through them.

But she couldn't think of what to say. Whether a sincere expression or a
kind deception would ultimately become an irreparable regret, an
eternally unhealing wound.

She laughed self-deprecatingly, exhaling. "Tell Franca to live well, on
my behalf.

"My spirit will forever be with her."

"Okay," Anthony responded in a calm voice.

The palm pressing on Ludwig's shoulder inexplicably revealed
blue-colored blood vessels.

Jenna thought for a moment and added, "If the apocalypse passes, I hope
you enjoy life.

"Ludwig, humans are always full of pain, but I still like being human."

Jenna withdrew her gaze, stabbing the potion into herself, her hand
steady, not trembling, just like when she killed Hugues Artois with the
long-handled silver fork, only less swift.

The taste of soil and stone mixed together, lingering in her mouth.

Her senses gradually went numb, her body rapidly petrifying.

She felt her spirit floating midair, seeing herself in the mirror.

She saw herself in the mirror, serene, with a smile, seemingly waiting
to welcome herself.

Though no ritual was held and no reconciliation reached beforehand,
Jenna suddenly understood that her mirror self was also willing to
sacrifice herself to save Lumian.

"She is indeed more extreme than me...

"She should have made the decision earlier than me..."

Jenna laughed again, whispering two sentences.

Suddenly, she was no longer anxious, no longer panicked, no longer
afraid, because on this path to death, she was no longer alone.

She had a companion, a companion who encouraged and supported each
other.

During the process of her instinct drifting toward her mirror self,
Jenna suddenly saw "her" face twist, alternating between normal and
painful, as if becoming a stranger.

This change seemed constrained, as if bound by layers of chains,
requiring tremendous effort and overcoming numerous difficulties to
complete.

"Come quickly..." Jenna, for the first time, cheered on the enemy who
wanted to kill her.

___

In the grayish-white, cave-like area behind a mirror.

Demoness of Black Clarice pretended to be at her limit, a step too slow,
and could only "watch helplessly" as Franca escaped into one of the no
longer petrified phantom tunnels.

*Phew...* she secretly exhaled.

Just then, her spirituality suddenly warned her, and she abruptly
turned, looking towards the grayish-white stone altar.

Franca bizarrely appeared nearby, and a clear, misty light shot out from
the eye protection of the mechanical half-face mask she was wearing,
striking the altar.

The one who had just escaped was only Franca's mirror self!

And the one following the departing "mirror self" was a Mirror
Projection!

The Demoness of Black's gaze instantly froze, but it was too late to
stop it.

Invisible barriers suddenly appeared around the altar, provided by the
ritual itself.

But for some reason, this protective power was insufficient, lacking the
intensity a ritual for the Primordial Demoness should have, as if some
inexplicable force had blocked most of the divine blessing.

Under the clear, misty light, the invisible barrier was instantly
reduced to its most basic, minute components and ceased to exist.

Immediately after, the clear, misty light hit the bone-like figurine of
the Primordial Demoness.

The figurine swayed and began to crumble.

Seeing this, the Demoness of Black was like someone trapped in a
nightmare, frozen in place.

For added security, Franca took out the Primordial Demoness figurine and
the Inevitable Gun from her Traveler's Bag.

She threw the figurine towards the altar, then fired two shots in quick
succession.

*Bang! Bang!*

Two dim, green bullets shot out, each striking a bone-like figurine of
the Primordial Demoness.

Certain Death!

Both the already crumbling and the intact statues began to rot, losing
their luster, completely shattering.

___

Deep within the special mirror world.

Primordial Demoness Cheek smiled as She observed the changes occurring
in Lumian's body.

His features were gradually being corrected, shifting towards Alista
Tudor's likeness. On his body, the two intertwined Demoness figures were
half-merged into him, driving his flesh to converge toward his neck.

After the earlier burst of light, the process was now irreversible.

Suddenly, one of the Demoness figures withdrew, attempting to straighten
her body.

Her expression was vivid, filled with both hatred and longing.

The Primordial Demoness clad in the white bone dress instantly
understood what was happening.

A pure female Demoness was ascending to the rank of Demoness of Unaging!

And at the most critical moment!

The stunningly beautiful face of Primordial Demoness Cheek darkened.

She was about to direct Her gaze at the advancing pure female Demoness
to kill her first!

Although the barrier formed by the burst of light isolated the interior
from the exterior---temporarily preventing The Fool from entering and
also hindering the Primordial Demoness from directly sensing or
influencing the external situation---Cheek had already made preparations
to prevent unexpected outcomes.

She had instructed Her most trusted high-ranking Demonesses to set up
altars at different locations within the mirror world, placing figurines
there to conduct rituals. She used Her authority and symbols to
establish a robust mystical connection!

By now, those connections must have weakened, and the rituals would no
longer be strongly protected. Yet, as the mirrored Original
Creator---the Oldest One---Cheek could barely maintain the existence of
these connections and use them to project part of Her power to eliminate
hidden threats.

The Primordial Demoness swiftly cast Her consciousness toward the
figurine closest to the target, only to discover with astonishment that
the figurine had been destroyed and the connection severed.

Her expression remained unchanged as She immediately scattered Her
consciousness toward the remaining figurines still involved in the
rituals.

The next second, a vision appeared before Her eyes: it wasn't the
advancing pure female Demoness---it was a black trench coat.

The interior of the black trench coat was empty, with the coat itself
outlining a human figure.

Grafting!

The Primordial Demoness realized that Her gaze on Jenna had been Grafted
by Mr. Fool back onto Herself!

In an instant, one of the Demoness figures entwining Lumian struggled to
break free. A black bone dress wrapped around Her, and She disappeared
from the spot, following the mystical connection to where Jenna was.

The fusion within Lumian's body immediately lost its balance.

His chest, neck, shoulders, torso, and limbs, along with the remaining
Demoness figure, all collapsed inward, as if about to turn into a mass
of flesh. The flesh converged into a clump, continuing to compress.

The two Tudors fused within his head, along with the Sequence 1
Conqueror Beyonder characteristic, were also dragged downward by immense
force. They pierced through his skull, through the flames and frost, and
through the writhing flesh.

The barrier of light at the edge of the special mirror world suddenly
vanished.

___

Floating closer, Jenna finally saw the distortion and pain on her
mirrored self's face disappear entirely.

"She" lifted her face and gave Jenna in midair a bizarre smile, opening
her arms wide.

Jenna did not resist. She closed her eyes and moved forward, accepting
the embrace.

She felt warmth and reassurance, which made her want to fall into a deep
sleep.

She offered no resistance.

It was as if she had returned to her childhood, listening to her mother
hum a lullaby and her father's soft snores, drifting into slumber.

Back then, though life wasn't particularly great, she had nothing to
worry about. Her father and mother would take care of everything; she
only needed to be a good child.

She grew more at peace, more tranquil.

She believed her mother and father would shield her from the storm,
ensuring she slept soundly.

In that serene dream, she would be a princess, and her prince would walk
toward her, inviting her to dance.

A smile appeared on her face.

Her thoughts dissolved into the encroaching madness, settling into a
tranquil darkness.
