## Chapter 895: A Brief Battle

The Demoness of Black slightly raised her chin and let out a piercing
shriek.

Invisible sound waves instantly caused the mirror to take on a
grayish-white, dim color. Along with this, Clarice's hair broke free
from its constraints, knocking off her hat and floating upwards. Each
strand became thick, as if carved from stone.

This grayish-white spread out from the full-length mirror, causing the
intense white-blue fire snake that had rushed to the mirror's front to
freeze in place, turning into a statue. It failed to explode the mirror
as Lumian had expected, destroying the Demoness of Black's medium for
interfering with the interior of the Bottle of Fiction.

The grayish-white created by Clarice continued to spread, like surging
tides, quickly engulfing the nearby armchair, sofa set, and cabinets,
causing them to lose their luster, take on a grayish-white color, and
appear much harder.

This grayish-white "tide" rapidly covered the entire room, enveloping
both Lumian and Franca.

Under the constraints of the Bottle of Fiction, facing such a wide-range
attack, Mirror Substitution seemed to have lost its effect, because
after using a substitute, one would still appear in a petrifying area.

The next second, Lumian and Franca, covered in thick dust-like
particles, regressed into grayish-white stone mirrors, but their figures
did not appear anywhere within the Bottle of Fiction.

The Bottle of Fiction itself seemed to have undergone petrification,
turning into a grayish-white, completely sealed cage.

Seeing this scene, the Demoness of Black in the full-length mirror
murmured to herself, "Did they escape?"

The current situation indicated that Lumian, relying on the abilities of
a Demoness of Despair, and Franca, using the power of the Ice Amulet,
had managed to hide in a mirror just before being petrified, then
traversed and escaped.

The current problem was that, given the Demoness of Black's control over
the mirror world, she could easily intercept the two in some illusory,
dark tunnel, but she hadn't sensed any movement.

At this moment, the Demoness of Black Clarice received a warning from
her spirituality and suddenly turned around, casting her gaze towards
the dense, illusory spider web behind her.

In one of those dim, unreal tunnels, Lumian, wearing a black cloak and
very tall, held up an exaggeratedly shaped iron-black straight sword
with one hand, descending from above to slash at the Demoness of Black.

Escape?

Someone holding the Sword of Courage wouldn't consider this option!

If they were to escape, it would be using the retreat as a feint for
advancing by setting a trap!

The intense white-blue flames on the Sword of Courage instantly surged
into intense black, like boiling pitch, carrying the violence and
madness to destroy all things, spirit and flesh.

Simultaneously, Lumian's naturally hanging left palm imperceptibly
pressed towards the Demoness of Black from a distance.

On his wrist, which was like a work of art, he wore a silver-white and
black bracelet that looked cheap. His crystal-clear, light blue eyes
took on a silver-black hue.

*Boom!*

The black flames, suppressing intensity and madness, exploded in
mid-air. Fierce shock waves carrying countless black fires surged
towards the Demoness of Black Clarice.

This ageless Demoness didn't use Petrification to respond. Her body
rapidly thinned and shrank, flashing a faint light.

She became a mirror.

*Crack!* That mirror shattered in the explosion, its
spirituality completely exhausted in the black flames.

The Fire of Destruction mixed in the terrifying explosion further
engulfed the entire area behind the mirror, extinguishing all signs of
life.

But when the Fire of Destruction extinguished and the explosion's
aftermath ended, the figure of the Demoness of Black outlined in one
corner of the void black area behind the mirror.

She seemed able to control the timing of her return to reality after
using Mirror Substitution, avoiding appearing in the fire while the Fire
of Destruction was still burning.

Suddenly, behind the Demoness of Black, a mirror hidden in the darkness
appeared. It directly reflected Clarice's figure, and in the mirror was
also Lumian, his clean face tinged with a dark hue from the remaining
firelight.

Mirror Projection!

As soon as this Lumian appeared, he immediately transformed into quiet,
evil black flames, enveloping the Demoness of Black's figure in the
mirror.

Only at this moment did the Demoness of Black seem to sense the danger,
actively using Mirror Substitution.

But she was still a beat too slow. Her appearance in this corner, in
front of this mirror with Lumian's Mirror Projection, wasn't
coincidental, but a carefully designed outcome!

Lumian's earlier apparent frontal attack with the Sword of Courage was
actually focused on his left palm that wasn't holding the sword.

He wore the Circle of Binding to elevate his ability to Compelling Fate
to Sequence 4 level!

And he had just consumed nearly a third of his spirituality to make the
fate of where the Demoness of Black would appear after using Mirror
Substitution predetermined, making the corresponding tributary become
part of the main stream.

Thus, the Demoness of Black "actively" walked into the trap, standing in
front of the mirror with Lumian's Mirror Projection.

At the same time, to prevent the Demoness of Black from detecting the
danger in time, Lumian had, on one hand, applied anti-divination
treatment to that mirror before launching the attack, and on the other
hand, deliberately let the Fire of Destruction cover the entire area
behind the mirror, making every corner look like there was no
ambush---even if there was, it would obviously be destroyed by the Fire
of Destruction. But in reality, relying on his Precision ability, he had
covertly made some Fire of Destruction bypass the pre-placed mirror.

Under these various schemes, the Demoness of Black failed to use Mirror
Substitution before Lumian's Mirror Projection launched the Demoness's
curse.

The Demoness of Black's deep gray eyes, seemingly hiding rain and mist,
suddenly widened, and quiet, evil black flames burst forth from within
her body.

These black flames burned fiercely, quickly igniting the soul of the
Demoness of Black Clarice, accompanied by a silent explosion.

Curse plus Cull!

*Crack, crack*, the figure of the Demoness of Black kept
flashing, turning into mirror after mirror.

Those mirrors successively lost their luster, becoming dim, but unable
to extinguish the black flames burning the Demoness of Black from the
inside out.

After a few seconds, the Demoness of Black Clarice, too weak to use
Mirror Substitution, saw Lumian's figure walk up to her.

This beautiful girl wearing a black cloak, making her face appear even
fairer, raised the huge straight sword burning with intense white-blue
flames.

That iron-black giant sword came down with a thunderous sound, chopping
at the Demoness of Black's neck.

*Boom!*

This pitiable lady was torn to pieces, scattering around in the form of
corpse pieces carrying black flames.

Franca's figure returned from another void dark tunnel, looking at the
large number of corpse pieces on the ground, and said with a stunned
expression, "Is it resolved just like that?"

This was the Demoness of Black, a Demoness titled by color!

Previously, Franca had only hoped that Lumian could briefly suppress the
Demoness of Black, not giving Clarice a chance to interfere with her
action of escaping through the mirror world. If she successfully
escaped, it would be much easier for Lumian, as a Sequence 4 demigod, to
disengage from the battle afterwards.

Of course, Franca would inevitably hope to find an opportunity to use
the Certain Death effect of the Inevitable Gun to accomplish the feat of
slaying a demigod. If that failed, she could still use Sure Hit plus
Impregnating Bullet to give Lumian a chance to destroy the enemy.

Lumian didn't put away the Sword of Courage, staring at the
still-burning corpse pieces, and said carefully, "She showed Sequence 3
level in some abilities, but overall seemed stiff and inexperienced. Not
only did she not seem like an experienced Demoness of Unaging, but she
also seemed a bit weaker than a normal Demoness of Despair. She didn't
even notice when I was placing mirrors while invisible..."

Before Lumian finished speaking, as the Demoness's black flames finished
burning, those corpse pieces began to fade, gradually dissolving, as if
returning to formlessness.

"Not the normal Demoness of Black." Franca quickly made a judgment.

"This also means we have no spoils," Lumian laughed, saying to Franca
who had already used up the last Mirror Traversal ability of the Ice
Amulet, "Let's return to the real world first, and I'll come back later
to check what's left in the end."

Franca understood that Lumian was worried that the abnormal state of the
Demoness of Black might lead to a corpse transformation or bring other
accidents. If only he came to check, it would be much safer.

Without being reckless, Franca pressed her hand behind the mirror,
leaving this area and returning with Lumian to the living room of
apartment 702.

Everything here had turned to stone, and with the removal of the Bottle
of Fiction, grayish-white powder fell like rain.

Franca covered her mouth and nose, muttering, "This is severe
pollution."

She reached into the Traveler's Bag, intending to take out the remaining
verl d'or and leave it here as compensation for the damaged furniture.

At this moment, Lumian suddenly had a premonition. His figure
disappeared in an instant, melting into the shadows, hiding in the
bedroom where Jenna had originally lived.

The next second, Franca also sensed something with her spirituality,
casting her gaze towards the glass window that had been protected by the
Bottle of Fiction and had not yet petrified.

The left part of the double-opening glass window suddenly darkened,
quickly outlining a figure as if reflecting an image on water.

That figure wore a black, elegant court dress, with black hair coiled
up, wearing a hat with a dark veil hanging down. Her face was
indescribably beautiful, her deep gray eyes bright but revealing
undisguisable sorrow, her red lips slightly curved, her chin beautifully
arched. Not only men but also women who saw her would instinctively feel
pity.

Demoness of Black!

Demoness of Black Clarice!

At this moment, Franca was a bit stunned.

*Did the Demoness of Black get reanimated?*

*No, even if it was a reanimation, it should have appeared on the
full-length mirror in the living room!*

*If it isn't reanimation, who is this now, and who was that
earlier?*

As Franca's mind instantly tensed, the Demoness of Black on the glass
window gently nodded and asked in a soft voice, "What exactly happened a
few days ago that made you only return now?"

*This attitude... it's very amiable...* Franca, who had
initially thought of drawing her gun and attacking, suddenly felt
confused.
