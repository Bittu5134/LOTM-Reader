## Chapter 570: Festival

On Aquina Street, a two-story ceremonial boat crafted from wood,
cardboard, and adorned with ribbons rolled forward, propelled by four
sleek horses.

This intricate vessel mimicked the Governor of the Sea's boat, designed
to economize materials and size, allowing horses to guide it through the
city.

Eight men and eight women, dressed vibrantly, stood on both upper and
lower levels of the betrothal ship. They sang and danced, their joy
infecting the spectators on both sides of the street.

Port Santa's premier folk orchestra surrounded the ceremonial boat,
playing rhythmic drumbeats and a variety of instruments such as
clarinets, oboes, flutes, and strings.

The onlookers on the roadside were in high spirits, alternating between
singing and following the ceremonial boat, hoping to catch a refreshing
spray from the water droplets scattered by the sixteen men and women.

Observing the scene from the fifth floor of the Solow Motel, Lumian
sensed that the sea prayer ritual had evolved beyond a mere sacrificial
ceremony. Excluding its core aspects, it had transformed into a
city-wide folklore festival.

Despite many residents of Port Santa being devout followers of the Earth
Mother and not attributing spiritual significance to the sea, they
embraced the festivities, dancing and celebrating on this special day.

As the betrothal ship concluded its tour of Aquina Street, Lumian turned
to Lugano and remarked,

"Take good care of Ludwig today. No matter which celebration you attend,
ensure he's with you."

"Yes, Boss," Lugano replied, influenced by the cheerful atmosphere of
the sea prayer ritual, his emotions lifted.

Without wasting any time, Lumian snatched his golden straw hat, exited
the suite, and descended the stairs.

In the lobby, his gaze fell upon Otta Guillaume, the Solow Motel owner,
doling out cash to the lady at the front desk and the two
attendants---two risot each.

"Is this a holiday bonus?" Lumian inquired in Intisian.

Otta Sr. chuckled and replied, "No bonus, just their compensation.
They're on duty at the motel today, keeping an eye on the place. They'll
miss out on the sea prayer ritual and other celebrations.

"I'm heading to the docks to see my little cabbage dance!"

"I'll be there too," Lumian said with a smile, embracing the festive
ambiance once again.

If the sea prayer ritual lacked mystic elements, Lumian would have fully
immersed himself in the festive atmosphere, reminiscent of the few years
of Lent he experienced in Cordu.

Exiting the motel, Lumian leisurely strolled towards the harbor, taking
note of Port Santa's residents bedecked in their most glamorous and
festive attire. At a glance, the streets appeared to be awash with a sea
of colors.

His attire---a white shirt, black vest, and dark pants---made him stand
out like a foreigner amidst the lively crowd.

Lumian adorned the golden straw hat, injecting a splash of color into
his appearance.

The rhythmic chime of bicycle bells accompanied the passing of wooden
crate-laden bicycles. Vendors energetically peddled popsicles of various
flavors to eager citizens anticipating the sea dance and boat race.

Observing the two segments with a relaxed demeanor, Lumian savored the
festivities. He patiently waited until the two-story festival boat,
carrying the Governor of the Sea and the Maidens of the Sea, embarked on
its journey to Milo Village before departing the port.

Choosing to abstain from other citizen-organized celebrations, Lumian
sought refuge in a public washroom within the nearest department store,
slipping into a cubicle.

Triggering the black mark on his right shoulder, Lumian materialized in
a concealed corner of Milo Village.

Shifting into a shadow creature, he seamlessly infiltrated the Oro
family's blend of ancient and modern architecture, arriving at Juan
Oro's bedroom.

The president of the Fisheries Guild awaited Lumian's arrival, and upon
seeing the figure of the adventurer, Louis Berry, emerge from the
darkness, Juan Oro, with deep wrinkles, gestured towards the unconscious
Milo villagers on the floor.

"These are two of the four deputy hosts for the vigil and the sea
sacrificial ritual. Choose one to assume his form."

This condition was pivotal for Lumian's collaboration with Juan Oro. He
sought continuous participation in the core sections of the sea prayer
ritual.

Initially hesitant due to the inability to deceive other sea spawn and
introduce a stranger onto the ship, Juan Oro only agreed to allow Lumian
to infiltrate the Governor of the Sea's residence before the vigil
ritual, observing it discreetly.

However, with Ultraman under suspicion as a key figure in the Fisheries
Guild, Lumian seized the opportunity when Juan Oro required cooperation
and assistance, showcasing the abilities of the Lie earring. Thus,
Lumian devised a plan to disguise himself as a specific deputy host and
gain access to the ship.

After studying one of the deputy hosts for a few moments, Lumian adorned
a silver earring. He replicated the appearance of the chosen deputy
host, seamlessly blending into his guise.

In no time, except for his clothing, there was no discernible difference
between Lumian and the deputy host.

"It's my turn," Juan Oro said in a deep Intisian voice.

He decided to take on the guise of another deputy host and personally
board the ship to avert any potential mishaps.

Concerned about Louis Berry's involvement in the sea sacrifice and wary
of lurking enemies employing unknown methods to cause trouble, Juan Oro
believed that everything would converge during the sea sacrifice
segment. Boarding the boat covertly would enable him to address
unforeseen circumstances in time, delivering a strategic "surprise."

Juan Oro harbored suspicions that Louis Berry might be an accomplice of
last year's saboteurs, his prior actions serving as a ploy to deceive
them and allow him to openly disrupt the ritual at a crucial moment.

Lumian casually tossed the Lie earring to Juan Oro, who proceeded to
change into a dark-blue robe embroidered with various sea elements.

Upon donning the silver earring, Juan Oro experienced a remarkable
control over every detail of his body.

Attempting to adjust the wrinkles on his face, he observed himself
becoming ten to twenty years younger in the mirror.

Despite his potent and diverse Beyonder powers, the president of the
Fisheries Guild couldn't help but marvel.

"How magical."

After completing his disguise, Lumian pointed at the unconscious deputy
host.

"Who's responsible for keeping an eye on them and preventing their
appearance before the sea prayer ritual?"

"My wife," Juan Oro replied, already prepared.

She, a former Maidens of the Sea and the current Matriarch of the Oro
family, possessed considerable strength. While she hadn't participated
in any ring-making rituals, she was a trusted individual who wouldn't
divulge secrets.

Lumian redirected the conversation, inquiring, "As the president of the
Fisheries Guild, won't you be suspected if you don't wait for news of
the successful sea prayer ritual with the other committee members?"

"No, I don't go every year. I can also wait for news at home, and my
wife will pretend to be me," Juan Oro stated, pointing at Lie on his
left ear and removing it.

After confirming the details, Lumian inquired further, "Have you
investigated any of those who nearly died and came back to life, or have
their personalities undergone a significant change?"

These individuals were key members of the Fisheries Guild familiar with
the specific design of the Ring of the Sea Queen and the complete
details of the sea prayer ritual.

According to Franca, every member of the Curly-Haired Baboons Research
Society was a soul from another world, having "resurrected" in recently
deceased human bodies. This information could help identify who might be
Ultraman.

Juan Oro slowly shook his head.

"No, at least not in my memory. Time was tight, so I couldn't
investigate them one by one."

The rejuvenated elder, now appearing in his prime, continued, "Remember,
your name is Brian now. My name is Jorge. If you don't understand what
others are saying later, it's fine. I'll hint at you. When you need to
answer questions, I'll help you."

"Alright." Lumian maintained the pretense of not knowing Highlander.

In reality, having extensively studied under the effects of the Language
Comprehension charm, he had already mastered more words and grammar.
While still unable to fully comprehend others' words, he could grasp key
words, tense, and the active and passive voice, allowing him to roughly
understand the meaning. Expressing himself with short sentences and
simple structures presented no challenge.

Clad in the dark-blue robe of a deputy host, Lumian entered the Governor
of the Sea's residence, guided by Juan Oro, who no longer staggered.
Passing through a hall adorned with sea creature statues, they reached
the room where the Governor of the Sea maintained his vigil.

The current Governor of the Sea, Simon of the Guiaro family, was from a
branch with a thin bloodline, unqualified to reside in the ancestral
house.

At that moment, Simon sat cross-legged on the cold floor, suppressing
his excitement. With half-closed eyes, he felt the moist air enveloping
him.

Although Lumian refrained from activating his Spirit Vision, he sensed
various sea spawn bustling in the shadows, the void, and the statues.

Juan Oro led Lumian out of the room, guiding him to the most secluded
part of the building. Opening the wooden door to the servants' quarters,
Juan Oro addressed the fake Governor of the Sea, Miguel, lying on the
bed.

"Once the sea prayer ritual succeeds, you can leave, but you must depart
Port Santa with the wealth you've amassed over the past year."

Miguel sat up excitedly. "Alright, alright!"

Though their conversation occurred in Highlander, Lumian grasped the
essence.

After this exchange, Juan Oro translated the conversation for Lumian,
emphasizing, "You can verify if I'm lying based on Miguel's expression."

Lumian silently pondered, thinking, *So what if you're not lying? What
you said might not be done...* He then returned to the hall,
assuming a cross-legged position opposite the other two deputy hosts.

As time passed, midnight arrived, marking the completion of the Ring of
the Sea Queen. One of the deputy hosts retrieved it and guided it to the
basement in the dim moonlight.

The moment had come to pay homage to their ancestors.

Lumian observed the scene in silence and suddenly had a thought.
