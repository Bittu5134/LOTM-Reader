## Chapter 60: "Dancer"

Lumian was in no rush to track down Ryan, Leah, and Valentine. Instead,
he headed straight for the Ol' Tavern, hoping to get lucky.

If that enigmatic woman showed up, he had a slew of questions for her!

Accepting her gift had bound him to some future cost. He might as well
seize the chance to gain more benefits, as Aurore had advised.

The instant Lumian stepped into the Ol' Tavern, his eyes sparkled.

The mysterious woman sat in her usual corner seat, two glasses of
emerald absinthe before her.

*Two glasses? She knew I'd come?* Lumian approached her with a
smile and greeted her.

"Good morning."

She wore a white blouse with vine-leaf patterns at the collar and a
beige ankle-length dress, a light-red beret beside her.

Lumian, no stranger to his sister's fashion magazines, recognized this
as Trier's latest trend.

She glanced up at him.

"It's getting late. Almost noon."

*This is to fit your schedule, isn't it?* Lumian thought,
annoyed.

But seeing the enigmatic woman brought him a strange sense of calm.

He sat and cut to the chase.

"I've been through a lot lately."

She slid a glass of absinthe his way. The swirling green liquid was like
a beacon of joy.

She neither invited him to speak nor silenced him.

Lumian sipped the absinthe, finding it rich and invigorating, with a
subtle bitter note. It tasted different from any absinthe he'd had
before.

"What's this?" he asked, puzzled.

"Another kind of absinthe---quite popular in Trier these days. To
differentiate it from the original, people call it absinthe fennel.
Authors, painters, and poets are particularly fond of it." She took a
small sip.

The green liquid in the clear glass seemed to possess a hypnotic hue.

Absinthe's main ingredients were wormwood, fennel, and anise. Different
producers used slightly varied recipes, some even adding lemon essential
oils.

Lumian didn't understand her motives. Had she traveled to Trier just to
bring back absinthe fennel?

He didn't ask. Instead, he recounted recent events, both real and
dreamed.

She sipped from her small cup of absinthe fennel, listening quietly to
Lumian's account.

"That's about it. Can I learn that mysterious dance as quickly as
possible?" he asked, bluntly.

He didn't bother inquiring about the loop's key or the dream's secret.
Experience told him he wouldn't get a straight answer.

The woman swirled her emerald liquid and smiled.

"Without a significant boost in flexibility, you'll never master it.

"You could force yourself through a portion, but you'd risk ligament and
muscle tears. How would you hunt monsters then?"

Lumian was attuned to the subtext in others' words.

"Is there a way to greatly increase my flexibility?"

She chuckled. "That's for you to figure out."

"..." Lumian was stumped by her cryptic hint.

If she were a less mysterious acquaintance, he'd demand, "Explain
yourself! Don't make me kneel and beg!"

As if reading his mind, she smiled and added, "The solution to your
flexibility lies within you."

"Huh?" Lumian looked perplexed.

She sipped her absinthe fennel and sighed.

"Didn't your sister teach you ritualistic magic?"

Lumian noticed the strange emotion flicker in her eyes once again.

"She did." His heart quickened. "Pray to myself?"

She assessed him and laughed.

"Who do you think you are? What good would praying to you do?

"You can only summon the weakest creatures from the spirit world. Your
spiritual perception improves with your body."

*Danger intuition, for example? *Lumian grasped the gist of her
words.

Though Hunters' spirituality was enhanced, it focused on spiritual
perception and fell short in ritualistic magic and other mystical
matters.

"So, what do I need to do?" Lumian pressed.

The lady sighed wearily. "You've studied dualistic ritual law, haven't
you?"

"Yes." Lumian nodded.

The lady sighed again. "Luckily you have a sister. Otherwise, I'd have
to teach you all this mystic mumbo jumbo. Too tiresome."

*You mean you didn't tell me about ritual magic, Cogitation, Spirit
Vision, contracted creatures, or magic languages because it was too much
hassle? You just showed up after Aurore finished teaching me?
*Lumian felt rage bubbling up inside him.

He took a couple of deep breaths and said, "Dualistic rituals require
items closely tied to deities or supernatural beings, but I don't have
any..."

His voice trailed off as a thought struck him.

The woman smirked and said, "Oh yes, you do.

"Don't you remember?"

Lumian jabbed a finger at his chest.

"The thorn symbol and the bluish-black symbol?"

The lady nodded before reminding, "Forget the bluish-black symbol. The
key to a dualistic ritual is channeling the divine power in the object.
If its power decreases, the balance in your body will be disrupted. And
when that happens..."

She left the sentence hanging but her expression told Lumian all he
needed to know.

In Aurore's usual grim words: "No hope. Just wait for death!"

"Is the bluish-black symbol protecting me from corruption?" Lumian knew
enough about the mysticism to recognize his current state as corruption.

"It's the great existence I mentioned protecting you," the woman said
solemnly. "Once you solve the secret of the dream ruins, I'll tell you
His honorific name. You can pray to Him directly."

*Did this great existence seal the corruption symbolized by the thorn in
my heart, preventing it from corrupting me completely?* Lumian
didn't know if this great existence was good or evil, or had sinister
intentions, but he felt an odd affinity with Him on this.

He thought for a moment and guessed, "Use a dualistic ritual to steal
the power of the thorn symbol?

"If its power decreases, the corruption will weaken and the seal
strengthen?"

"How can you call it stealing?" the lady retorted. "This is appealing to
an entity for a boon. It just so happens He has some of His power
nearby. The response follows the law of proximity. Thanks to the seal
from the great existence and barriers attenuating it, the entity's true
form won't sense it."

*Only mystics like you who speak in riddles understand how to sugarcoat
it... What's the difference between this and stealing?* Lumian
thought sourly.

From the lady's explanation of divine boon and abnormal pathways, he
asked shrewdly,

"Through the dualistic ritual, can I appeal to the power behind the
thorn symbol and ask it to grant me the ability to greatly increase my
flexibility?"

"Something like that," the lady said. "To be precise, ask it to grant
you the power of Dancer."

"Dancer?" Lumian thought of Noodle Man's performance.

The lady took a sip of absinthe and said, "For Beyonder pathways beyond
the standard 22, we classify them into Sequence 9 to Sequence 0 for
convenience.

"In a way, this Sequence division follows the rules of this world.

"Does Dancer correspond to Sequence 9 of the thorn symbol, just as
Circle Inhabitant corresponds to its Sequence 4?" Lumian fired off. "Can
it boost my flexibility and improve my mystic skills, allowing me to
easily grasp that mysterious dance?"

The lady smiled in relief. "As expected, with a foundation in mysticism,
communication is much easier. No need for me to explain further."

Lumian asked eagerly, "Then what are Sequences 8, 7, 6 and 5 of the
thorn symbol?"

"Sequence 8 is Alms Monk, and Sequence 7 is Contractee. Gosh, why do you
want to know so much? Master the ritual first and strive to become a
Dancer as soon as possible." The woman was losing patience.

*Alms Monk... Contractee... *These names instantly clicked for
Lumian.

Alms Monk referred to certain members of the various churches in
reality.

The Eternal Blazing Sun Church was rife with factions, each with their
own beliefs. Two main groups stood out; the Order of Preachers and the
Brotherhood Minor, also known as the Alms Monk Brotherhood.

The former was made up of clergymen and the Purifiers of the Inquisition
who were dedicated to the cruel persecution and purification of
heretics, cultists, and wild Beyonders, all in the name of promoting the
orthodox teachings of the Eternal Blazing Sun.

The latter, however, were mainly concentrated in the cloisters, with a
few clergymen among their ranks. They espoused temperance, begging for
food and ascetic training, preaching in various poor places, all with
the aim of spreading the faith of the Eternal Blazing Sun.

At the mention of the Alms Monk, Lumian immediately thought of
missionaries, asceticism, and special ritualistic magic.

As for Contractee, the first thing that came to mind was the black mark
on the padre and the mouth orifice monster.

Aurore explained that it might be a mark left behind by a special
contract.

"Wait, the monster I killed was a Contractee?" Lumian asked in surprise.

*I actually killed a monster equivalent to a Sequence 7?*

The lady nodded slightly and said, "Yes, Contractees use special
contracts and godhood provided by that existence as witnesses to obtain
different powers from various creatures. One contract corresponds to one
ability.

"Whether they're powerful or not depends on the abilities they obtain
and how many they have. It's not impossible for ordinary people to kill
them if they take the wrong path.

"In fact, similar situations occur in the Beyonder domain. It's common
for Beyonders who aren't skilled in combat to be killed by those of an
inferior Sequence.

"Ability is important, as is intelligence. Preparation in advance is
equally significant."
