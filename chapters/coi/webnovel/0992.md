## Chapter 992: The Unknowing Questioner

Luo Shan sat in a café near the police station, monitoring Franca and
Jenna's whereabouts using a white pigeon she had temporarily modified.

She had drawn her own mark on the pigeon, as well as a hidden miniature
camera. By wearing sunglasses with a receiving device drawn on them, she
could obtain the corresponding signal. At the same time, she could use
the connection between a Painter and a painting to drive the
corresponding mark, thereby directing the pigeon.

Of course, this had to be maintained within a certain distance.

After seeing Franca and Jenna come out of Star Dream Provisions Store,
Luo Shan quickly had the white pigeon follow them.

As she followed, she found that the two targets were approaching the
police station area, which was where she was.

Luo Shan's heart skipped a beat.

Fortunately, her anxiety didn't last too long. Franca and Jenna only
came to this street and didn't actually walk to the café door.

*Phew...* Just as Luo Shan breathed a sigh of relief, she saw
Franca and Jenna, who were already five or six steps away from the café,
disappear into thin air simultaneously.

*Wh---* Luo Shan's pupils suddenly dilated.

The next second, two people sat down opposite her.

One was Luo Fu, the other was Jian Na.

Luo Shan's movements froze instantly, as if she had turned into a
statue.

"Were you monitoring us?" Jenna asked in a friendly manner.

Franca put the two mirrors in her hand on the coffee table, creating a
Mirror Maze.

"I-I wanted to see what you were really doing, if you were deceiving me,
if you were bad people." Luo Shan's voice gradually rose.

*It's still the aftereffects of the talk about the dreamscape... I
wonder if the Mirror Maze can deceive a Reporter's ability to explore
the truth? Probably not... How to guard against this kind of prying in
the future? Communicate important things via phone and delete chat
records afterwards using the Information Shredder? No, except for me,
Lumian, Jenna, Anthony and Ludwig don't speak Chinese, phone
communication is done through voice conversion, which can also be
heard... The Bottle of Fiction probably can't isolate it either, unless
it's the Realm of Mysteries... Can we only communicate in places far
away from a Reporter in the future?* Franca thought of many
things in an instant.

Suddenly, she had a flash of inspiration and looked at Luo Shan.

"You can follow us openly if you want, you can watch from the side if
you want to see, it's just that some things will be more dangerous, we
may not even be able to protect ourselves well. Um, if we're going to
face this kind of thing, we'll tell you in advance, and you can weigh
whether you want to follow or not."

Luo Shan didn't expect Franca and others to be so honest, and was
momentarily speechless.

Franca took the opportunity to say, "We're going to a place next to
confirm whether certain people have become more fake. Do you want to
go?"

Confirm if they've become more fake? Luo Shan suddenly felt a bit
scared, but she didn't want to deceive herself forever and not uncover
the answer.

After a moment's hesitation, she said, "I'll go."

Franca laughed. "It's good that you have the ability to explore the
truth, you can intuitively help us confirm, without us having to devise
dangerous plans."

She didn't know yet if Lumian's Eye of Calamity could discover the
problems with Huang Jiajia, Ai Nana and others, so she planned to use a
Reporter's ability.

This way, they might even discover the aspects in which the fake people
were fake, and thus obtain key evidence that could be reported to the
police.

Moreover, Jenna had previously told Franca that since Luo Shan already
knew the current world was a dream and was in a state of unwillingness
to believe, full of doubt but unable to completely deceive herself, they
shouldn't delay, lest she did something stupid because of it, or her
mental state became problematic and was exploited by that evil god of
the Fantasy Association.

Jenna felt that, having already chosen to be honest and truthful, they
should continue this style. On the one hand, stabilize Luo Shan's mental
and emotional state through psychological treatment, and on the other
hand, let Luo Shan face the truth step by step under their control,
confirm the facts, and not let her imagine, try, or do things blindly,
which could likely bring greater disaster.

In other words, when problems had already appeared and couldn't be
avoided, it was better to place them under one's own control and release
them with precautions, rather than letting the problems develop on their
own.

So, for something that could have been done with the Mystery Prying
Glasses, they chose to ask Luo Shan for "help".

†

Outside Star Tutoring Classes.

Franca and Jenna brought Luo Shan to a white car that was unlocked and
unoccupied.

Anthony, who had received a WeChat message from Franca, was already on
standby nearby, ready to treat Luo Shan if she had a mental breakdown.

"This is?" Luo Shan didn't expect there would be such a car waiting by
the roadside for them to use.

"Our companion drove it over; to convenience our observations," Franca
explained simply.

Luo Shan asked in understanding, "Lumina who played cards with us?"

That's how Franca and the others had introduced her.

"Sort of," Jenna had no intention of letting the Spectator onto the
stage.

After a while, they saw Huang Jiajia walk out of Star Tutoring Classes.

"It's her," Franca quickly informed Luo Shan.

Luo Shan raised her right hand through the car window, pinching the
sides of her eye sockets.

She then saw the target person overlapping with windows, street trees,
and cars.

She also saw a large number of invisible threads floating out from the
target's body, extending towards the sky.

These threads were tied to the target's joints and organs.

With the pulling of these invisible threads, the target made
corresponding movements, walking towards the nearest bus stop.

*It's just like a puppet on strings...* Luo Shan's hair stood on
end.

When she had explored the truth before, she hadn't seen similar
situations with people around, or rather, similar situations weren't
obvious enough to be noticed by her.

Taking advantage of the time she had, Luo Shan observed the passing
pedestrians.

She saw that these pedestrians also had a large number of invisible thin
threads floating towards the sky, but these threads were all very loose,
without the tension of pulling the human body to make movements.

"..." Luo Shan's body suddenly tensed, then slumped, leaning sideways
against the backrest of the car's rear seat.

She ended her exploration and said as if sleep-talking, "It's indeed
more fake..."

"What are the specific details?" Jenna tried to alleviate the emotional
impact on Luo Shan by discussing business.

Franca sent a message to Anthony: "Closely monitor the target's state."

Luo Shan described in a floating voice the scene she had seen and the
comparison between the target and normal people.

During this process, Anthony, who was in disguise, pretended to be a
middle-aged man smoking by the roadside, drawing closer to Luo Shan, and
quietly using Placate.

After Luo Shan finished speaking, she fell completely silent, not saying
a word.

Jenna and Franca looked at her sympathetically, temporarily not starting
a new topic.

They were waiting for Anthony's notification. Only when Anthony said it
was okay would they speak, and only when Anthony said what aspects to
talk about would they construct corresponding language.

"I want, I want to go to the North City Cemetery," Luo Shan finally
spoke.

"Okay," Franca immediately agreed.

At the same time, she received a message from Anthony, who had turned
his back and used voice input: "The target's emotional state has
stabilized to some extent, but there are still remnants of negativity,
pessimism, and despair.

"Don't talk about anything, any casual words in the current situation
might stimulate the target. Only answer when she asks."

Franca forwarded these messages to Jenna, then started the car and drove
onto the main road.

The car was silent again, with only the faint sound of the engine.

After the vehicle reached the North City overpass, Luo Shan, who seemed
to have become a clay puppet, muttered to herself, "In realit---in that
world outside, is there another me?"

"Yes," Jenna answered.

She strictly followed the Psychiatrist's instructions, only answering
Luo Shan's questions without any expansion.

Luo Shan fell silent again.

Finally, the car arrived at North City Cemetery and stopped in the
parking lot.

Luo Shan pressed the door handle, paused for a few seconds, and said,
"I'll go in by myself, you don't need to follow."

"Okay," Jenna and Franca responded in unison.

Luo Shan opened the car door and put one foot out.

At this moment, she half-turned her body and asked with dark eyes, "Are
you here to awaken Zhou Mingrui?"

"Yes." Jenna didn't hide it.

On this topic, she felt it necessary to say a few more words, so she
added, "If Zhou Mingrui isn't awakened, everything will be destroyed
when the apocalypse comes, including this dream.

"And the apocalypse is only a few years away."

Luo Shan looked at the seat cover in front of her with empty eyes, as if
wanting to confirm details, "Why did Zhou Mingrui need to sleep?"

"To fight against an evil force," Franca explained concisely.

This was consistent with the core of the story she had made up before.

Luo Shan maintained her previous posture and asked subconsciously, "Has
that evil force been defeated, so Zhou Mingrui can be awakened?"

*Wh---* Hearing this question, both Franca and Jenna were
shocked.

They looked at each other, unable to answer Luo Shan's question for a
moment.

*Yes, if the Celestial Worthy's consciousness has been defeated, Mr.
Fool could wake up on his own. If He hadn't been defeated, how would
forcibly awakening him be essentially different from the situation
before he went to sleep?*

*Or does the act of "awakening" itself symbolize the defeat of the
Celestial Worthy's consciousness?*

*Mr. Fool wakes up while the Celestial Worthy is still asleep, will
there be a change in the balance of power, with the scales of victory
tilting towards Mr. Fool?*

*If this guess is correct, that's fine, but if it's wrong, does it mean
our direction isn't right?*

*The Major Arcana have always focused on "awakening", but should we
actually weaken the Celestial Worthy first?*

"We're currently still in the stage of confirming the situation, we're
not sure if that evil force has been defeated yet," Franca answered
truthfully.

Luo Shan bit her lip and didn't ask any more questions.

She got out of the car completely and walked into the cemetery's
attached flower shop, buying two bunches of white chrysanthemums.

She walked slowly forward, her figure gradually disappearing among the
tombstones.
