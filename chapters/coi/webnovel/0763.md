## Chapter 763: Folklore Origins

Lumian "kept his promise" and sat at the table with the two Demonesses
for only a few minutes before politely taking his leave, leaving the
nearby men somewhat perplexed and puzzled.

*Shouldn't he have seized the opportunity to pursue further?*

*Could this be the advanced technique of an Intisian playboy and
Dandyist?*

Walking back to his own table, Lumian saw waiters carrying a towering
stack of plates, their faces a mix of confusion, shock, and fear as they
walked away.

All the dishes on the menu had really been devoured!

The look in their eyes towards Ludwig and Lugano was as if they were
staring at monsters who had crawled out of the abyss.

*If you knew that two-thirds of those dishes and mains were consumed by
Ludwig, and Lugano and I only shared the remaining third, you'd be even
more scared, worried you might be eaten too. Well, that worry would be
justified...* Lumian muttered silently as he sat down.

Before him, Ludwig, and Lugano, there was now a slice of apple cake and
a cup of richly flavored ice cream.

Ludwig's face was unmasked in satisfaction, the most fulfilled he had
felt in a long time. This was not only because the Feysacian meals were
generous in portion and tasty but also because it didn't hurt Lumian to
spend someone else's money.

Lumian pushed his slice of apple cake towards Ludwig and appeared to
concentrate as he scooped up the milky ice cream with a spoon and placed
it in his mouth.

As he savored the melting frost and the spreading taste of milk, he
whispered to himself, "Have any of you noticed anything unusual around
Two of Cups and Seven of Cups?"

After a brief silence, a faint, ethereal voice echoed in Lumian's ear.

It was from the Knight of Swords Maric.

"We did notice something, from Chaban Street until you approached St.
Millom Restaurant, but only a slight abnormality was detected, and we
couldn't pinpoint its origin."

*This matches Franca's description and my speculation, confirming each
other... The temperance faction's demigod is unable to catch Oxyto even
though they have started tracking Franca and Jenna... Can we only wait
for Oxyto to make a move?* Lumian thought for a few seconds and
pulled out a pair of non-prescription, plain gold-rimmed glasses for
disguise from his Traveler's Bag, placing them on his nose.

He immediately saw the image of the Knight of Swords dressed in a shirt
and vest highlighted in the lenses, then disappearing.

The voice of Maric became clearer.

"We occasionally find such slight abnormalities and corresponding traces
too, and that is also one of the main reasons we are sure that Oxyto is
still in the Raklev area."

*Can Paramita alone achieve this, managing to move undetected under the
nose of a demigod with strong spiritual intuition?* Lumian,
lacking a deep understanding of Paramita, could only speculate based on
his past experiences.

He had entered Paramita more than once!

In Cordu, whether in reality or in dreams, he had entered Paramita
several times, but at that time, without high-level forces involved, he
couldn't judge the normal state of Paramita and whether it could deceive
a demigod's senses and intuition when it unfolded;

In Trier, during the Tree of Shadow catastrophe, he was involuntarily
drawn into Lady Moon's Paramita, which effectively isolated the inside
from the outside, preventing Trier's demigods from detecting the growth
of the Tree of Shadow and the fighting in that area. It was only through
Franca's use of the Judgment card and the unique properties of Madam
Judgment that they managed to establish a connection with the outside
world, allowing the Tarot Club's demigods to pinpoint and descend into
Paramita. At that time, the demigods of Trier were far from Rue
Anarchie, unaware of anything hidden there, which could be understood
and accepted...

Memories flashed through Lumian's mind, and he always felt that Paramita
could not reach the current extent.

*When Paramita closed, it was normal that the temperance faction's
demigod couldn't sense it even if nearby, but how could it remain
undetected after unfolding right under the nose of the temperance
faction's demigod?*

*Is it that powerful?*

*I think even Lady Moon's Paramita couldn't achieve that, only capable
of masking activities and protecting itself through distance from being
detected...*

Lumian turned his gaze to the window, seeing two locals among the
passersby; one had a human skull painted purple hanging on his chest,
and the other tied a bleached white human skull on top of his head.

*Death worship...*

*Paramita...*

*Perhaps, Shaman King Oxyto has developed a special aspect of his
Paramita in the Raklev area, which allows him to unfold it in front of a
demigod without being detected, at least until there's substantial
interaction...* Lumian speculated, piecing together Madame
Pualis's plan to use the folklore of Cordu to enhance her own Paramita.

Lumian took another spoonful of milky ice cream and lowered his voice
again.

"Tell me more about the origins and circumstances of the Skull Blessing
Festival."

Knight of Swords Maric replied clearly in his ear, "It dates back to the
fall of Death, when the situation on the Southern Continent
fundamentally changed.

"The fall of Death caused disturbances in the Underworld, leaving most
spirits unable to sense or enter it, forced instead to wander its
periphery, between the spirit world and the real world.

"As a result, when sentient beings die, they are very likely to become
undead, wraiths, or evil spirits---a grave threat to the living, leading
to one disaster after another.

"The response of the Northern Continent nations has been
Church-sanctioned purification combined with compulsory cremation. Here,
the Eternal Blazing Sun Church and the God of Combat Church have had
notable success with purification, making cremation unnecessary for
those who have been purified."

Hearing this, Lumian truly understood and appreciated the various
measures taken before and after death, including consoling the dying,
purifying the dead, encouraging cremation, and rewarding the discovery
of deceased vagrants.

The origins of all these practices was the fall of Death and the
subsequent anomalies in the Underworld!

*No wonder the old bones in the lower layers of the underground tombs
are still bones, not ashes... During the Fourth Epoch, the Underworld
hadn't yet been disturbed, and the spirits had a place to return to...
Some mysticism knowledge suggests that bodies are prone to transform at
the end of the Fourth Epoch during the Pale Disaster, caused by Death's
invasion of the Northern Continent. Indeed, it is the legacy of the Pale
Disaster; Death perished during that disaster, leading to the anomaly in
the Underworld...* Lumian suddenly realized, gaining a deeper
understanding of certain mysticism knowledge.

The Knight of Swords continued, "The same issues arose on the Southern
Continent, but the Balam Empire, home to many Beyonders following the
Death pathway, swiftly devised several solutions that quelled the undead
outbreaks in certain areas without resorting to mandatory cremation,
thus restoring normalcy.

"In other regions, however, due to ongoing independence efforts from
countries like Haagenti, Paz, and the Highlands, faith in Death began to
wane, leading to a period of rampant undead plagues and a power vacuum.
The people in these areas had no choice but to fend for themselves."

Lumian nodded slightly.

"Is the Skull Blessing Festival a solution for the Raklev area?"

"The Skull Blessing Festival is just one manifestation," explained the
Knight of Swords simply. "According to records left by the Highlands
Kingdom, it appears that the people of Raklev, with the help of a former
official from the Balam Empire, established a mini-state for the
spirits, allowing the dead to enter and rest there without emerging
again.

"However, this isn't the Underworld; it cannot truly offer rest, nor can
it completely bind the spirits. They just have to gradually fade away.

"The annual Skull Blessing Festival is a day for the spirits to emerge,
revel, and be liberated. Keeping the skulls of loved ones at home helps
to protect the family from any spirits that might stray from this
mini-state, preventing them from causing harm."

*In essence, they created a rudimentary, localized version of the
Underworld for spirits to return to...*

*A place to return to... The concept of Paramita is similar, where souls
return to the earth and wander the wilderness...*

*Moreover, in Paramita, spirits can return home on special days to enjoy
the joy of reunion, much like the Raklev area's Skull Blessing
Festival...*

*The only difference is that here, the spirits have no path to rebirth;
they can only slowly fade away...* Lumian compared the local
state for the deceased to Paramita and grasped something subtle.

He recalled something Louis Lund once relayed from Madame Pualis:
*What's been established is merely a small, caricature Paramita, a part
of the complete Paramita...*

*Hmm...* Lumian inhaled sharply, muttering under his breath,
"Could Oxyto be planning to merge this local spirit realm into his own
Paramita, to make it more complete?

"Has he, no, she already partially succeeded, which is why you haven't
detected her?"

Knight of Swords Maric paused for a moment before responding, "It's a
possibility."

After a brief pause, he added proactively, "We also haven't seen that
spirit realm."

*Seen... *Lumian was initially startled but then understood what
the Knight of Swords meant.

The Prisoner pathway could directly turn into wraiths, and they should
have been able to see the spirit realm, but they found nothing in Raklev
this time.

Lumian didn't respond but considered another issue.

*If Oxyto has indeed begun to merge with that mini-spirit realm, she
essentially becomes a local version of Death, and she must have sensed
the Omebella bloodline in me...*

*What would her reaction be?*

*Instant anger, or seeing it as something to be exploited?*

*Why didn't she act directly? Right, she also used the bird-clawed
monster baby to discover that Ludwig nearby had the aura of a corpse
'mother,' adding up to what clearly looked like bait, obviously a
trap!*

*That's why she, accustomed to indulgence, held back. What she needs to
do now is, seek assistance?*

With that thought, Lumian removed his glasses and abruptly stood up.
