## Chapter 1168: Easily Triggered Malice and Desire

When the Inextinguishable Ravings reverberated, targeting the spiritual
imprint of the Original Creator, Amon, who had long since transitioned
to the Inevitability pathway, was largely unaffected. His Sequence 1
identity as the Angel of Redemption was fully capable of suppressing the
madness and chaos originating from the Sequence 2 Trojan Horse of Fate.

Under the protection of the Chaos Sea, Amon patiently observed the
battlefield, especially where the four sefirot were engaged in fierce
combat with two Great Old Dominators.

He waited for an opportunity---perhaps only a single chance.

Patience was a virtue He had always possessed.

†

On a distant planet.

Leading the angelic legion, Medici found the situation improving after
weathering the initial two waves of attacks.

More Angel-level Beyonders left their protected zones to join the
battle, including ancient Angels like Ariehogg and Hermes, who had
previously remained hidden, as well as the remaining Western Continent
cultivators who had finally understood the gravity of the situation. The
invading Outer Deity Blessed were disorganized, forming only small,
scattered groups of a few to a dozen at most. Furthermore, They seemed
to be rejected by the spirit world itself!

Except for the subordinates of the High-Dimensional Overseer and those
with limited access to the astral world, the rest had lost Their ability
to Teleport and Blink. Even the Beyonder powers derived from the
Inevitability pathway angels' Contractee had largely failed, as Their
contractual partners were mostly spirit world creatures.

These Outer Deity Blessed had also lost Their spiritual intuition and
Their ability to quickly recover spirituality via the spirit world,
among other disadvantages.

Red Angel Medici, overseeing the battlefield, quickly identified the key
targets for the next phase: Dimensional Shadows and Observers.

After a dozen seconds, He found an opening.

The entire angelic legion, originally blocking the protected zones,
suddenly vanished, leaving behind only a barrier of light and seals of
starlight.

The invading Outer Deity Blessed were momentarily stunned. What They
truly desired was the Angel-level Beyonder characteristics.

Their prepared attacks landed on the barrier of light, causing it to
tremble violently but not shatter completely.

The angelic legion reappeared in a corner of the sky battlefield,
beneath the thin shadowy figure lurking in an inaccessible height.

Teleport!

Mass Teleportation!

Immediately, several Angels in the legion acted according to
pre-arranged mental channel communications.

The Magician Fors extended her hands, creating a dazzling, dreamlike
door of starlight at an inaccessible height.

She forcibly opened a door to a higher dimension.

Antigonus swiftly made a wish and realized it. "My wish is for most of
the Observer's revival arrangements to fail."

He avoided wishing for "all" revival arrangements to fail, wary that
some might be miracles beyond His level to disrupt, potentially warping
the entire wish.

As long as most of the opponent's revival setups were neutralized,
forcing Him to retreat and spend more time reviving, the strategic
objective would be achieved!

The faster the revival arrangement, the easier it was to disrupt. Those
beyond Antigonus' miracle and possibly involving higher dimensions would
likely require more complex, secretive processes, consuming additional
time for a Sequence 1 Observer.

This was typical logic, though unforeseen exceptions could occur---the
target might have arrangements involving higher levels or means to
quickly revive Himself. Regardless, it wasn't Antigonus' responsibility
to deal with those.

As a legion member, He only needed to fulfill His assigned task.

In the territories of the Life School of Thought and the Aurora Order,
two mercury-colored serpents had already been prepared. One blessed Red
Angel Medici, while the other, using the open dimensional door, imposed
a heavy misfortune upon the target.

This arrangement handled unforeseen circumstances.

Justice Audrey; the ancient dragon,Ariehogg; a massive rabbit and other
Angels of the Spectator pathway hovered above the legion, Placating each
member's minds to counter the terrifying voices echoing within.

Meanwhile, Angels like The Star Leonard and Saint Viève intercepted
nearby Outer Deity Blessed, preventing Them from aiding Their targets.

The entire legion functioned like a seamlessly coordinated machine, each
part performing its role with precision and order.

Demoness of Catastrophe Franca shared her Demoness's black flames with
Medici, watching as the Red Angel's iron-black eyes swung His terrifying
greatsword bound with destruction toward the Observer.

The Observer immediately fled to another dimension, but behind Him, one
starlight door after another opened, keeping Him tethered to reality.

The black-flame greatsword of destruction slashed through the starlight
doors, finally striking the Observer.

The Observer twisted and disintegrated, becoming illusory.

This was not his true body---it was a self-created illusion!

Crack!

A faint, almost inaudible sound of shattering echoed. Medici's Sword of
Destruction had struck the connection between the illusory self and the
true body, hitting a weak point.

The illusory Observer was ignited by the Fire of Destruction, and the
true body, far away in another dimension, also caught fire with
horrifying black flames!

The Observer let out a cry of pain, His aura rapidly weakening.

Although He was not killed outright, He suffered serious injuries. All
His revival and recovery setups had been rendered useless.

His luck was abysmal.

Without hesitation, the Observer ascended dimensions again, retreating
from the battlefield and never returning.

He feared being pursued in His weakened state and worried that His
greedy allies might secretly shift Their targets to Him.

After all, a Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristic was at stake!

The angelic legion, having succeeded in their assault, disappeared once
more, avoiding further encirclement and attacks from more Outer Deity
Blessed.

They returned outside the protected zone, where Saint Dabomachie
repaired the barrier of light by driving an orange greatsword into it.

†

The star-cluster-like Supernova Dominator observed the endless, layered
barriers of doors blocking His way. Without hesitation, He caused
several supernovae to erupt simultaneously.

A vast, ferocious sea of brilliant light swept through the region,
consuming all the doors and wreaking havoc on the surrounding spirit
world.

This cleared all obstructions to the astral world and even helped the
Mother Tree of Desire eliminate several Kleins wearing half-height silk
top hats and black trench coats.

Suddenly, at the edge of the terrifying sea of light, a Klein appeared.
Raising his right hand, he snapped his fingers.

The supernovae erupting from Supernova Dominator underwent an immediate
Change---an error in their state. They began to collapse violently
toward a single point.

This immense gravitational collapse pulled the Supernova Dominator's
star-cluster form, threatening to create an unimaginably massive black
hole.

The Klein who snapped his fingers was quickly consumed by the sea of
light, evaporating with no resistance. But the Supernova Dominator was
forced to stabilize His structure, lest the intense gravity and
exaggerated explosions destroy His body.

When He finished, the endless, layered doors reappeared around Him.

Klein's primary focus was directed at the Goddess of Fate, attempting to
leverage restraint to find an opportunity to severely wound and drive
away this eldest daughter of the Mother Goddess of Depravity, even in a
one-against-three situation.

At this moment, the Mother Tree of Desire, relying on the symbolism of
Desire, had already located the true body of Lord of Mysteries Klein.
However, Klein paid no heed to this discovery, instead swiftly Grafting
the surging desires in his heart onto various marionettes one by one.

Some of these marionettes became greedy, others furious, others filled
with love, and still others overwhelmed by longing. Yet, they were
quickly released from manipulation and died on the spot.

The remaining marionettes continued to blockade the Mother Tree of
Desire.

Almost simultaneously, the shadows wandering the River of Fate suddenly
surged upward, forming a massive black trench coat.

Foolishness!

Klein wielded the symbolism of Foolishness against the Goddess of Fate!

†

In the battlefield where the four sefirot clashed with the two Great Old
Dominators, the High-Dimensional Overseer had already seen through the
truth. From a higher dimension, He discovered the weaknesses within the
aggregate forms of the Celestial Master and the Celestial Thearch's
projection.

He swiftly ascended to the tenth dimension, intending to directly
disrupt the internal connections of these aggregates from there.

At this moment, the Celestial Master swung His horsetail whisk.

A vast flood of knowledge spanned multiple dimensions and poured into
the mind of the High-Dimensional Overseer.

This knowledge was not only vast and complex, making it impossible for
even a Great Old Dominator to fully absorb in a short time, but it also
activated sequentially, transforming into grotesque and bizarre illusory
creatures that tore at the High-Dimensional Overseer's thoughts,
consciousness, and spirit.

These creatures even instigated rebellion among the High-Dimensional
Overseer's pre-existing knowledge, causing them to become animated and
mutinous.

Demons of Knowledge, the Secrets of Madness!

The High-Dimensional Overseer immediately fell into chaos, trapped in a
battle against Himself.

His turmoil brought about changes in all dimensions. The illusory,
coiled strings around Him unfurled and formed a painting that enveloped
the Celestial Master and the Celestial Thearch's projection.

As the Celestial Master and the projection entered the painting, it
became filled with suns, planets, and a variety of rules and principles.

The High-Dimensional Overseer did not expect this to seal the two
sefirot but merely set the exit in a concealed location to buy time and
suppress both the rebellion of His own knowledge and the influx of
external information.

The golden Buddha noticed this and immediately sought to reboot the
process to return the Celestial Master and the Celestial Thearch's
projection to the real world.

But before He could complete this task, distorted figures began to
emerge from His golden body---Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats, and Wisdom
Kings. These were the lingering spirits of the former Dao integrators.

They had all been awakened and corrupted!

This was the effect of Inextinguishable Ravings.

He was the symbolism of the spirit of living beings!

For aggregates composed of multiple spirits, Inextinguishable Ravings
were Their nemesis!

Conversely, Eternal Darkness could put chaotic and complex spirits into
slumber.

The pitch-black fiend faced an even graver fate.

Countless shadows emerged, gnawing at its own body. The Master of the
Shadow Cottage and Farbauti could only exert all Their effort to
suppress and fight against Themselves, unable to do anything else.

A tranquil and silent darkness spread from the distance, soothing the
chaos of the golden Buddha and the pitch-black fiend, allowing these two
sefirot to barely escape Their predicament.

However, this darkness was swiftly disrupted by the Monarch of Decay.

Realizing They would have to endure the effects of Inextinguishable
Ravings on Their spirits repeatedly and that Amanises's assistance might
not always be as timely as it was now, the Master of the Shadow Cottage
and Farbauti exchanged glances, Their eyes burning with resolute malice.

Time to risk everything!

They would make sure Their devourers paid a heavy price!

The pitch-black fiend immediately triggered an explosion of all the
desires it could sense in His surroundings.

The concentrated desires gathered by Inextinguishable Ravings detonated.
Unable to find the Knowledge Moor temporarily, He shifted His target to
the Tenebrous World.

For Him, this was not an optimal choice, one He would usually
avoid---but it was still an option!

With desire ignited and unable to care about anything else emerging from
the depths of the pitch-black fiend's heart, it transformed into
frenzied thoughts and formless consciousness that ravaged Farbauti and
the Master of the Shadow Cottage's souls, seeking to overwhelm Them
quickly.

Farbauti and the Master of the Shadow Cottage burst into laughter.

This was exactly what They wanted!

They seized Their final moments of clarity to curse Themselves and
everything attached to Them.

Everyone would die together!

Blood-colored flames erupted across the pitch-black fiend's body,
transforming It into a gigantic rabbit while turning the previously
formless Inextinguishable Ravings into the rabbit's consciousness and
spirit.

The blood-colored flames continued to burn, intent on consuming all life
in the vicinity.

From within the Chaos Sea, Amon observed the scene. Though surprised by
Farbauti and the Master of the Shadow Cottage's choice, He still stood
up.

He had waited for this opportunity!

Raising His hand, He used pre-obtained authority to retrieve an item
from Sefirah Castle.

It was the Uniqueness of the Chained pathway!

This Uniqueness bore the corruption of the Mother Tree of Desire, which
even Lord of Mysteries Klein could not remove in the short term. It was
also a vital component of the Tenebrous World, capable of connecting the
Mother Tree of Desire and the Tenebrous World, which were originally one
entity.

Now, Amon sought to use this connection to transfer the damage inflicted
upon the Tenebrous World to the Mother Tree of Desire, just as He had
once dealt with the Uncertain Mist.

He had not anticipated Farbauti and the Master of the Shadow Cottage's
rapid self-destruction but had merely intended to exploit the injuries
inflicted upon the Tenebrous World to achieve His objective. Now that
the situation had changed, He was determined to seize the opportunity.
