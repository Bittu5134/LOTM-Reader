## Chapter 1036: Wedding Dress

Glancing at the dark, bottomless end of the staircase, Lumian took out a
mirror and activated the contract ability on his body.

He immediately sensed the imprint on the full-length mirror in the Tudor
treasury, ready to dive into the mirror and traverse through at any
moment.

Maintaining this sense, Lumian reminded Franca and Jenna, "Walk close to
the sides later---very close."

From his experience, walking down the stairs this way would bring them
into the reflection range of that full-length mirror.

For Beyonders of other pathways, they only needed to guard against being
affected by the resulting illusions, scaring themselves crazy or to
death. But if Hunters and Demonesses let their shadows be reflected on
that full-length mirror, they might have their bodies snatched by the
long-fallen Alista Tudor through pre-arranged setups, allowing Him to
resurrect and return.

Lumian thought that given Alista Tudor's level of madness, He probably
wouldn't care whether it was a Blood Emperor or a Blood Empress who
returned, so the Demonesses should also be careful.

"Okay." Franca and Jenna had long ago heard Lumian explain what dangers
were in the Tudor treasury.

Even if they didn't know, in the current situation, they would heed the
advice first and find an opportunity to ask why later.

Lumian maintained the activation of the mirror imprint and let the
residual aura of the Blood Emperor on his right palm intensify from
faint to strong, covering it with pallor.

He hadn't yet started descending the stairs step by step when he
suddenly heard Madam Magician's voice. "I've located your mirror
imprint."

Along with the voice's response, points of dazzling starlight lit up,
enveloping Lumian and the others.

When vision was restored, Franca found herself in a corridor that seemed
to be formed of condensed starlight.

On both sides of this corridor were star-bright doors standing in the
darkness. The bottom was semi-transparent, revealing endless darkness,
while above there was no dome, with illusory stars dotting the distant
heights.

At the end of this deep and spacious corridor sat a silver full-length
mirror with a classic design and intricate patterns around its frame.

Almost simultaneously, Franca and Jenna noticed Madam Magician raise her
right hand and gently grasp towards the front.

Around that silver full-length mirror, space suddenly bent, forming a
sealed sphere in the state of deep shadows, blocking all light from
entering.

Lumian and the others could no longer see that silver full-length
mirror, and that mirror could no longer reflect them.

"This way we can be a bit freer," Madam Magician said with a smile.

Wearing a black robe with silver patterns, she turned to Lumian, Franca,
and Jenna and said, "You can choose the treasure rooms now. I'll handle
the dangers inside."

Franca and Jenna instantly looked towards Lumian, waiting for him to
demonstrate for the two of them.

Lumian looked left and right, slowly moving forward along the deep and
spacious corridor while casually saying,

"In the area above the gray fog, when I mentioned Madame Pualis and
Omebella, I also talked about a concern."

"What concern?" Franca asked cooperatively.

She and Jenna could both roughly guess that Lumian wanted to use casual
chat to distract his own mind, choosing treasure rooms purely based on
spiritual intuition and the characteristics, auras, and corruption on
his body.

Lumian, in his Demoness of Despair state with black hair cascading,
glanced at Madam Magician and Mr. Hanged Man and said, "At the end of
the awakening operation, there were two things I couldn't understand:

"First, why was there no movement from the Primordial Demoness, and
second, why didn't the Great Mother side try to stop it, even though She
had made many arrangements in the dream city.

"The lack of interference from other existences was expected. The
Celestial Worthy wouldn't wait until they were ready and could
effectively interfere with the internal situation of the dream before
letting Zhou Sasa come. If that happened, what might be suppressed could
be His hope for success. Moreover, Anderson's side would burn down the
Colorful Hostel and the Mute Art Studio, not giving the deity worshiped
by the Fantasy Association a chance to intervene, and there was also
true god suppression at Mushu Hospital.

"But the Great Mother had sent Madame Pualis with baby Omebella to be
the dean of Mushu Hospital. How did they not create even a ripple?

"Her forces in the dream city are not limited to Mushu Hospital. Whether
it's Grimm who was originally active outside the hospital, or Lu Yong'an
who can freely enter and exit the hospital, they could effectively avoid
the true gods' suppression of Mushu Hospital and do something."

"Maybe Peng Deng, Grisha, and Amon's side, who didn't appear in the
final stage, were blocking them?" Jenna speculated.

"That's one possibility," Madam Magician began to give her speech at the
Tarot Club. "But I have a bad feeling that perhaps the Great Mother has
already achieved Her goal, in a way that's in our cognitive blind spot."

"My experience is also that abnormal calmness is always problematic,"
Mr. Hanged Man followed up with emphasis.

Franca took a breath and turned her gaze to Lumian.

Lumian understood her meaning and smiled, saying, "The only revelation
Mr. Fool gave about matters related to the Great Mother was: become a
Demoness of Unaging, borrow the Gift of the Land, face the Abscessed
Hand."

After saying this, Lumian suddenly had a spiritual perception. He turned
to the right and pushed open a semi-transparent large door condensed
from starlight.

The light behind the door was dim, with no attack appearing.

Lumian waited for two seconds before passing through the door and
entering the room.

What met his eyes was a black coffin.

This coffin was different from the rectangular coffins Trier used daily,
with obvious curves, one end larger and one end smaller, its surface
carved with many bird and tree patterns.

"Eh..." Franca's head peeked out from Lumian's shoulder position, "Isn't
this a Western Continent style coffin? Where did the Blood Emperor get
it from?"

She already knew that the Western Continent had evolved from her
pre-transmigration country over thousands or tens of thousands of years
or even longer.

And judging from the fact that she could barely understand the language
of Armored Shadow Chen Tu and its attire, Franca felt that the
civilization of the Western Continent might not have experienced a break
in continuity like the Southern and Northern Continents, still
maintaining a certain continuity. The coffin style before her eyes
seemed to be another piece of evidence.

As for why, in a situation where civilization had not been interrupted,
the language and style of the Western Continent had "regressed" to what
she remembered as "ancient", she couldn't think of a reason for the time
being.

All the known transmigrators were in the Southern and Northern
Continents and the former Eastern Continent!

*No, Queen Mystic had said that the Ancient Sun God was not the kind of
"cocoon person" like us, and there was another transmigrator who hasn't
revealed their identity...* As Franca's thoughts gradually
diverged, Lumian and Madam Magician had already walked to the front of
that Western Continent style black coffin, with the latter causing the
lid to slide to one side on its own, falling onto the semi-transparent
ground.

Franca looked over and saw a beautiful face with tightly closed eyes,
pale and cold, saw a gorgeous phoenix crown and rosy clouds cape, and
saw bright red.

"Chinese wedding dress... bride's corpse... Dammit, what the hell is the
Blood Emperor up to?" Franca blurted out.

Before her words fell, that black coffin with patterns of pine, cypress,
and cranes began to shake violently.

A pale, delicate hand with long, gray nails that were sharp and cold
silently pressed on the edge of the coffin.

With this action, Franca and Jenna's lips suddenly became dry, as if
they were being roasted.

Outside the treasury, the Blue Avenger sailing through fierce winds and
huge waves suddenly plunged downward.

The wind stopped, the waves calmed, and water vapor rose from the azure
sea, evaporating rapidly.

On the surface of the Blue Avenger, the deck began to crack at a visible
speed. Even though the consciousness of this ghost ship was constantly
trying to repair it, it couldn't stop the trend from deepening.

Inside the Tudor treasury, in the corresponding room.

Before Madam Magician could deliver a barrage of attacks on the female
corpse in the coffin, Lumian stretched out his right palm.

His palm was darkly red and mottled, covered with pallor, a deep black
"pinhole" emitting an indescribable aura.

The female corpse wearing what Franca called a bright red wedding dress
and a golden phoenix crown stopped shaking, no longer giving the feeling
that it might crawl up at any moment. That delicate but pale hand slowly
slid down, returning to the side of the corpse.

All the abnormalities disappeared with it.

"The power of a Demoness of Catastrophe," Madam Magician said after a
few seconds of looking with eyes as brilliant as the starry sky, "And,
the power of an Undying... Can the boons of these two pathways be put
together?"

As she spoke, both she and Mr. Hanged Man looked towards Lumian.

Lumian looked at the dark "pinhole" in his palm, musing to himself,
"Maybe they can..."

This thing seemed to be a fusion of the residual aura of the Blood
Emperor, the boon of a War Bishop, the seal of the Underworld Daoist,
and the grade and knowledge of the Demoness card.

If such a hodgepodge could be put together, the separately picked out
powers of the Demoness and Death pathways should be able to as well.

Madam Magician and Mr. Hanged Man fell into deep thought, while Franca
associated the terms "Demoness of Catastrophe" and "Undying" with the
state and recent behavior of the female corpse.

She said in astonishment, "This, this couldn't be a drought demon, could
it?

"Did the Blood Emperor bring a drought demon to the Northern Continent?

"How did He manage that?"

*Isn't it said that the Western Continent was sealed by the power of the
Celestial Worthy, and that the barrier can only be opened for free entry
and exit after Mr. Fool truly gains the upper hand?*

*Before that, shouldn't only some secret deed rituals be
possible?*

*Even if the Blood Emperor really opened a passage before His death,
attempting to drag down all the gods with Him, that passage was sealed
in Fourth Epoch Trier, right? The Blood Emperor shouldn't have had time
to send this drought demon to the Blue Avenger...*

Hearing Franca's words, Madam Magician turned to the side and began to
explain, "The power doesn't come from Beyonder characteristics, it might
originate from the Western Continent or somewhere else, but the person
is from the Northern Continent."

"Uh..." Franca looked carefully and found that the hair of the female
corpse in the coffin was pale yellow, and her facial features were quite
pronounced.

"An artificial drought demon?" Franca said with some understanding, "The
Blood Emperor made a secret deed for some strange knowledge, and this is
the product of an experiment? The phoenix crown, rosy clouds cape, and
coffin are part of the knowledge, part of the ritual?"

Lumian nodded slightly, looking at the female corpse and said, "If we
let her wake up, can we help her regain her sanity?"

Madam Magician slowly shook her head. "'She' was probably born a
monster."
