## Chapter 850: Slow and Steady Wins the Race

Inside a four-wheeled, four-seater carriage.

Amandina sat across from Lumian, excitedly looking out at the Intis
parasol trees along the road, the still brightly lit shops, the
magnificent arcaded streets, gentlemen and ladies walking their turtles,
and some citizens in strange attire. She sincerely praised, "Trier truly
lives up to its reputation. It's even more wonderful than I imagined."

"I hope you won't take back that assessment after staying here for a
while," Lumian wanted to make a sarcastic remark, but there were so many
things worth mocking about Trier that he couldn't find the most
representative one at the moment, so he could only respond to Amandina
in this way.

Amandina turned her gaze away from the carriage window, saying with some
regret, "It's a pity I have to return to Port Pylos at dawn."

She planned to apply for entrance exams to some universities in Trier
after graduating from grammar school.

Amandina glanced at the coachman's seat in front, and lowered her voice
to ask Lumian, "Why don't we just... just teleport there directly?"

Lumian smiled leisurely.

"You're a guest. Of course I should show you around Trier."

Amandina scrutinized Lumian for a moment.

"I feel like you're deceiving me."

"Your feeling is not wrong." Lumian laughed without concealing anything.
"Going slowly allows the Law of Beyonder Characteristics Convergence to
take effect."

If he had teleported with Amandina to the entrance of the underground
catacombs and rushed to the Samaritan Women's Spring at the fastest
speed to complete what needed to be done, Harrison, the visitor from
Resurrection Island, might not have reacted in time, might not have been
affected by the law of convergence, and might not have made the decision
to sneak into the Samaritan Women's Spring again at night. Everything
would have ended without achieving the expected goal.

He had to leave enough time for the Law of Beyonder Characteristics
Convergence to take effect!

Sometimes, slow and steady wins the race.

"What... what are you trying to converge with?" Amandina, having
witnessed Lumian's performance during the Dream Festival, became nervous
all of a sudden.

"A target I'm currently tracking," Lumian leaned back against the
carriage wall and answered with a smile. "Don't worry, your safety is
absolutely guaranteed."

Hearing this, Amandina quietly breathed a sigh of relief.

Louis Berry was indeed a trustworthy person; he had fulfilled all the
promises he made.

What she didn't know was that if Franca or Jenna were here, they would
definitely ask in return, "Is only safety guaranteed? Won't there be any
injuries, torture, or impacts on the mind and spirit during the
process?"

Amandina glanced at the coachman's seat again through the carriage wall
and said softly, "Aren't you afraid the coachman will overhear what
you're saying?"

*You weren't lowering your voice at all just now!*

Lumian chuckled.

"He can't hear us."

Amandina was stunned for a moment, trying to understand with her
mysticism knowledge.

"Did you... did you quickly create a wall of spirituality?"

"You can think of it that way," Lumian couldn't be bothered to explain
to Amandina what a Bottle of Fiction was.

Amandina relaxed and asked with a smile, "Are those two ladies just now
your lovers?"

Lumian let out a derisive snort.

"Shouldn't you ask that question in front of them?"

"That would be so embarrassing! They would definitely get angry!"
Amandina's emotional intelligence was quite good.

"And I wouldn't get angry?" Lumian asked amusedly.

Amandina giggled.

"You don't seem like someone who would get angry over something like
this."

She suddenly pointed out the window.

"Is that the Trier Normal University?"

"Your technique for changing the subject is quite clumsy," Lumian mocked
Amandina without mercy.

And so, the four-wheeled, four-seater rental carriage arrived at Place
du Purgatoire at a normal speed.

As Lumian descended the stairs, he took out a white candle and tossed it
to Amandina, telling her about the various taboos inside the underground
catacombs.

Amandina listened very carefully and lit one of the candles by rubbing
it with spirituality.

"I've seen some of these in magazines, but never as detailed as what
you've told me today.

"Do these taboos really have to be followed? What happens if they're not
followed? For example, what if I hadn't lit a candle?"

As they spoke, the two had already arrived at the giant stone archway
inscribed with the warning "Stop! The Death Empire lies ahead!"

The catacombs administrator behind the door, with graying hair and
wearing a blue vest and yellow trousers, glanced at Lumian but did not
stop the two from entering the underground catacombs at night.

Lumian looked straight ahead, walking forward through the piles of
skeletons along the sides of the path, and said in a calm tone, "In that
case, you would disappear from this world. Your parents would forget
they had such a daughter, your former fiancé would forget he once had
such a fiancée, your friends would forget you, your servants would
forget you, and perhaps only I would remember you."

Although Amandina was a Beyonder equivalent to Sequence 7 and had
witnessed some of the tragedies that occurred during the Dream Festival,
and her former fiancé was particularly skilled at summoning the dead,
being in the underground catacombs---a gloomy, dark place full of
skeletons and permeated with the aura of death---she couldn't help but
feel a bit frightened and uneasy.

This, combined with Lumian's explanation, made the hair on the back of
her neck stand up, and she gripped the white candle even tighter.

"The first time I entered the underground catacombs, I thought this was
truly a perfect place for telling horror stories. Unfortunately, until
now, such opportunities have been rare." A smile appeared on Lumian's
face.

Amandina was stunned for a moment. "Were you just telling a horror
story?"

"Yes, and the most terrifying part of this horror story is that every
word of it is true," Lumian replied with a smile.

"..." Amandina was scared once again.

She quickened her pace, afraid of being left behind by Lumian.

As the two made their way to the fourth level of the underground
catacombs, there were no shortage of skeletons suddenly moving, trying
to trip Amandina, nearly causing the young lady to cry out in alarm.

Finally, Lumian led Amandina to the huge, decaying, and mottled tomb
chamber that housed the Samaritan Women's Spring.

He looked left and right and silently said to himself, *We didn't
encounter the shadow resembling Krismona this time... Was She wandering
around the fourth level of the catacombs before to find a female
Demoness, and no longer has such an obsession after achieving Her
goal?*

Lumian shifted his gaze back and tossed a mirror to Amandina.

"Hold this and wait for me here."

"Wait here?" Amandina looked around, slightly panicked.

The surroundings were pitch black, with numerous tombs, decaying and
dilapidated, with unknown things lurking in the shadows.

"It'll be quick," Lumian didn't offer any comfort, but went straight
through the half-open stone door into the tomb chamber.

After walking a few steps, he encountered the deeply wrinkled catacombs
administrator who looked more like a corpse than a living person.

The elderly administrator, also wearing a blue vest and yellow trousers,
did not stop Lumian but stood silently in place, allowing him to pass.

After reaching the gentle downward slope, Lumian took out a mirror and
the Black Tear accessory that had been burned for over half an hour from
the Traveler's Bag.

Outside the huge tomb chamber, Amandina saw Lumian's face appear on the
surface of the mirror by the yellowish light of the white candle, and
heard his voice.

"Press your hand against the mirror."

With experience, Amandina quickly pressed her hand holding the white
candle against the mirror surface.

Again, she passed through the familiar cold water flow, experienced the
familiar terrifying suction force and weightless falling sensation, and
soon found herself appearing beside Lumian.

Lumian put away the Black Tear and the mirror, pointing to the depths of
the slope. "It's down there."

___

In the gap between two ancient tomb chambers, twenty to thirty meters
away from the huge tomb chamber housing the Samaritan Women's Spring.

Franca, holding a white candle, carefully peeked out and glanced towards
the target location.

She then withdrew and muttered to Jenna, "This candle is really
annoying. We can't hide well at all. How are we supposed to ambush
Harrison like this?"

The dim yellow light of the white candle was quite conspicuous in the
deep, pure darkness.

Jenna looked at Franca and smiled. "It works both ways. Harrison also
can't approach silently without us noticing. Besides, hiding in this
corner can effectively reduce the impact of the candlelight. It won't
travel that far."

Franca knew all this and was just complaining casually.

She suddenly remembered something and asked with a twitching corner of
her mouth, "Have you seen Anthony?"

"Uh..." Jenna was also stunned.

At this moment, Anthony's voice came from outside the gap.

"I've been here all along."

Along with his voice, Franca and Jenna finally saw their companion.

He was standing openly on the path outside, holding a lit white candle,
and the two Demonesses hadn't noticed him before.

"Psychological Invisibility is really great..." Franca praised
enviously.

Psychological Invisibility worked on a completely different principle
from other invisibility abilities. It mainly involved placing oneself in
the psychological blind spots and cognitive dead angles of the
surrounding people, making them ignore the situation here. Therefore,
whether Anthony was holding a lit candle or not did not affect his
ability to become invisible.

Anthony simply replied, "Candlelight is a powerful attention-drawing
element here. It also reduces the effectiveness of my Psychological
Invisibility. I need to be very focused to maintain it."

Franca and Jenna stopped talking and hid in the gap between the tomb
chambers, listening to the sounds around them.

___

In front of the faintly contracting and expanding thin grayish-white
fog.

Lumian once again examined his own state.

That cold emanating from within his heart occupied his body, causing
most of his emotions and desires to wither, but the malice and
irritability resulting from the negative effects of the contract still
existed and were growing stronger.

He was in a very good state now, having endured without much reliance on
the abilities of the Ascetic.

Amandina had a similar reaction, one side of her face turning deathly
pale from the "freeze", while she gritted her teeth to prevent an
unfamiliar version of herself from emerging.

Lumian grabbed her arm and extended his left palm holding the white
candle towards the grayish-white fog.

As his chest warmed, the two successfully walked into the mist.

Everything became even more silent.
