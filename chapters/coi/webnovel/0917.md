## Chapter 917: Disease Bomb

The flesh and blood oozing yellow-green pus sprayed like sudden rain
towards everyone in the surveillance room, accompanied by the sudden
explosion.

Franca had no time to use the Ice Amulet, nor to grab Jenna and the
others to bring them into the compact mirror in her hand. She could only
face the explosion, which wasn't too powerful, and the obviously
dangerous flesh, blood, and viscous fluid.

*Crack! Crack! Crack!*

In this situation, the three of them could only actively trigger their
Mirror Substitutions, first being shattered by the impact wave, then
being coated with sticky flesh and still-writhing yellow-green pus.

Ludwig, who had also been given a Mirror Substitution by each of the
three Demonesses, didn't use it himself. Instead, he crouched down,
hugging his body tightly to minimize his "exposed area".

During this process, he opened his mouth.

His mouth corners stretched without any restriction, extending all the
way to the back of his head. His upper lip pushed his eyes, nose,
forehead, and other parts to face the ceiling directly, while his lower
lip nearly touched his chest.

Splat, splat, splat, the yellow-green flesh mixed in the explosion's
blast rushed into Ludwig's enormous mouth, heading straight for his
stomach.

Unfortunately, Ludwig, enjoying this buffet, only lasted two seconds
before involuntarily triggering his Mirror Substitution, shattering into
pieces.

This abnormally terrifying giant mouth shape seemed to be all appearance
without sufficient strength, only at the Sequence 7 level.

The explosive blast subsided in an instant, and the figures of Franca,
Jenna, and the others were reoutlined in the surveillance room, which
was now covered everywhere with viscous flesh and yellow-green pus.

As Demonesses of Affliction, Franca and Jenna both instinctively
believed that this place was now full of dangerous diseases, rapidly
infecting them.

Without hesitation, Franca raised her right hand, revealing the Ice
Amulet she was gripping tightly.

This crystal-clear charm had been remade by Lumian and could now be used
for Mirror Traversal four times.

As soon as they saw Franca reveal the Ice Amulet, Jenna and Anthony
immediately moved closer to her, grabbing her arm and sleeve. Ludwig
hesitated for a moment but still joined the vile Demonesses.

The next second, the four figures blurred and entered the compact mirror
in Franca's other hand.

Franca didn't linger at all, bringing her companions to traverse into
another metal decorative item with a mirror effect in the surveillance
room.

*Smack!*

The compact mirror, no longer held by anyone, fell to the ground and
shattered into pieces, causing the corresponding area behind the mirror
to collapse.

These shards would take different amounts of time to become mirrors
again in the mystical sense---without considering other factors, the
larger the shard and the better the mirror effect, the shorter the time
needed to regenerate the area behind the mirror. Conversely, smaller
shards would take longer, and if too small, they might risk never
becoming mystical mirrors again.

After transferring to the interior of the mirrored decorative item,
Franca spoke rapidly while remaining vigilant against a sudden attack
from the reanimated female corpse, "A Demoness of Despair doesn't have
the ability to make people half-dead and turn them into plague bombs...

"Could it be a Demoness of Unaging?"

"It could also be with help from the Order of All Extinction or
possession of a similar item," Jenna suggested another possibility based
on her own feelings.

"Is Mushu Hospital not just home to the Mother Tree of Desire?" Franca
suddenly had an inspiration. "The hospital as a whole should
simultaneously possess the healing abilities related to the Great Mother
pathway, the influence of the Mother Tree of Desire pathway on spirit,
desire, corpses, and hospital urban legends, as well as control over
diseases and pathogens from the one the Order of All Extinction believes
in or the Demoness pathway!"

As Franca spoke without any embellishment, she observed the situation in
the surveillance room and attempted to use the Ice Amulet's ability to
transmit information through mirrors to send simple intelligence to a
certain mirror on Lumian.

As long as Lumian hadn't left the current Huafeng District, he would
definitely receive it!

Jenna guarded against the direction of the illusory tunnel that
resembled a spider web, while Anthony said carefully, "That reanimated
female corpse is almost unaffected by Awe, making me feel she's more
like a dead person than a living one."

Franca's thoughts raced, and she immediately had two guesses.

"Is she an awakened Zombie, with a Mother Tree of Desire believer hiding
nearby controlling her?

"Or, didn't we guess earlier that she might have a companion, possibly
Loki? Is it possible that she's actually a marionette, with the
Marionettist hiding somewhere nearby controlling her?"

Franca had confronted Loki before and had contact with spies from the
Bureau 8 of Intis, so she was quite familiar with the antics of
Marionettists.

"But according to the information provided by the Major Arcana card
holders, even normal Marionettists can only control marionettes within a
range of about 100 meters. Now, with their abilities suppressed to
Sequence 7 level, I believe their maximum distance from the marionettes
won't exceed 40 meters. Before we came to the surveillance room, we
checked the surroundings and there was no one..." Jenna raised an
objection.

At this point, she suddenly paused.

It wasn't that there was no one; in fact, there were two people!

Franca and Anthony also realized the issue and simultaneously turned
their gaze towards the front of the surveillance screen.

There were indeed people within a 50-meter range---those two security
guards!

One of the security guards had been turned into a plague bomb and had
already disintegrated into disease-spreading flesh, but the other
security guard was still sitting in his position, his eyes concealing a
gray-white deep inside, staring motionlessly at the large screen!

Franca and Anthony's gaze fell on that security guard.

The security guard seemed to sense something and suddenly turned his
body.

His clothes were now tattered, his body pitted and uneven, different
areas of his face either missing skin, suffering abrasions, or with
flesh split open and festering.

These were the "aftereffects" of being directly hit by the explosion of
the other security guard.

The security guard, with half his face almost unrecognizable as human,
reflected the flickering light from the surveillance screen, curled his
lips, and revealed an exaggerated, terrifying, and sinister smile.

As his smile bloomed, his body rapidly swelled, becoming a human-shaped
balloon like his colleague.

*Bang!*

The balloon burst, and countless viscous flesh and yellow-green pus
splattered onto the surface of the metal decorative item where Franca
and the others were hiding, smearing it into a mess and preventing
Franca and Anthony from seeing the outside situation clearly.

"Let's change positions," Franca said, turning to Jenna and Ludwig,
seizing the opportunity while they still had a few more Mirror Traversal
charges.

†

In the Moon Plaza formed by the surveillance footage.

Lumian bent his back, drew the Sword of Courage, and sprinted from
outside the men's and women's restrooms towards the reanimated female
corpse at the entrance of the passage.

Behind him, on the wash basin mirror between the two restrooms, a female
figure wearing a white dress with a loose bun suddenly appeared.

This was a projection created by the Demoness of Despair using the
mirror!

Although it only possessed a fraction of the original body's power, it
was still capable of assassination. It aimed to deliver a fatal blow to
Lumian from behind!

Almost simultaneously, another figure emerged behind this female figure.

That figure had black hair, beautiful features, and a cold
expression---it was Lumian's feminized image.

This projection, completed with the help of Precision, instantly turned
into a ball of black flames brewing extreme destruction in silence,
completely enveloping the mirror image projection of the reanimated
female corpse, causing her to be thoroughly ignited amid painful wails.

*Thud! Thud! Thud!* Lumian, wielding the Sword of Courage,
continued without any pause, charging towards the reanimated female
corpse without looking back.

At this moment, in front of the reanimated female corpse, crystal-clear
but sharp frost spears suddenly condensed, like a beautiful and clean
hedgehog showing its spines.

Such a forest of ice spears couldn't be accomplished by a Sequence 7
Witch. Only a Beyonder who had reached the Demoness of Despair level and
gained further control over frost, but was currently restricted to
Sequence 7 level, could do this. It was equivalent to the Ice Spear
Condensation ability evolving into Ice Spear Forest at Sequence 4, but
now the Ice Spear Forest was only at the Sequence 7 level.

If Lumian didn't stop in time, he would crash into this forest of ice
spears, being pierced through and creating multiple bloody holes.

At this moment, Lumian's figure suddenly became blurry and distorted,
like an image displayed through electromagnetic signals suffering from
strong interference.

It took only the blink of an eye from becoming blurry and distorted to
completely disappearing. Lumian's body quickly outlined behind the
reanimated female corpse.

He swung the Sword of Courage diagonally, chopping towards the target's
shoulder.

With a whoosh, crimson flames ignited on the surface of the Sword of
Courage.

Boom, Lumian's single stroke cleaved the reanimated female corpse into
two pieces, exploding her into mirror shards.

The reanimated female corpse, having used a substitute, didn't appear
immediately, seemingly disappearing into the dark, empty fourth floor of
the mall.

Lumian's expression didn't change at all as he pressed the Sword of
Courage downwards in one smooth motion.

*Boom!* Crimson fireballs flew out from the sword,
indiscriminately covering this area, collapsing walls and igniting
merchandise.

The crimson fire hell quickly engulfed nearly half a floor in
continuously rising high temperatures.

Under such a wide-range indiscriminate attack, the figure of the
reanimated female corpse was affected, forced out of her invisible
state, and appeared to Lumian's side and rear.

†

Inside the surveillance room.

The reanimated female corpse who had previously fought with Franca and
the others left her hiding place in the mirrored object and appeared in
the room now covered everywhere with viscous flesh and yellow-green pus.

Taking advantage of the opportunity that various pathogens and decay
forces were permeating this place, which would quickly infect and affect
Franca and the others once they entered, she condensed a long ice spear
covered in white frost in her hand and thrust it towards the
surveillance screen, which already had multiple dents and was covered
with flesh and pus.

The power of the two previous Disease Bombs wasn't strong, mainly
focused on spreading pathogens and decay forces, so they couldn't
directly destroy the large screen that was at a certain distance from
them.

Now, the reanimated female corpse wanted to personally destroy the
surveillance screen, causing the corresponding alternate space to
collapse, making the enemies fighting there and her other "self" fall
into the chaotic flow together, to be torn into pieces!
