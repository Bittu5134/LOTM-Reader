## Chapter 59: Again

Noodle Man danced once more, and Lumian confirmed that the mysterious
dance could prevent the black thorn symbol on his chest from activating
fully. It produced no terrifying sound, only an illusory whisper.

This was highly advantageous for Lumian's "special" trait in the
dreamscape.

However, he discovered two problems:

Firstly, Noodle Man's dance moves were extremely difficult and violated
the human body's structure. Only a monster with exaggerated flexibility
like Noodle Man could complete them. Although Lumian was a Beyonder and
a Hunter with a greatly enhanced body, he had no confidence in
replicating them himself. He feared that dancing even once would result
in ligament tears, muscle strains or worse, fractures.

Secondly, the dance stirred the surrounding powers of nature and
depleted Lumian's spirituality considerably.

After watching it for the third time, Lumian sighed silently, realizing
he needed rest. I have to go back and rest after watching this.

*A Hunter's spirituality is really useless!*

He was almost certain that the hidden existence corresponding to the
thorn symbol was closely related to this dream ruin.

The padre had a black mark on his body, and there was a dancing monster
that could activate the thorn symbol. It would be surprising to say that
it had nothing to do with the hidden existence!

Lumian believed Aurore's guess even more, thinking of the similar symbol
on the padre's chest and the dream ruins rebooting along with reality.

The key to resolving the loop might be hidden in the depths of this
place, playing a vital role.

*Is that why the mysterious lady kept hinting at me to unravel the
secret of the dream ruins?* The more Lumian thought about it,
the more frustrated he became. He raised his left hand, which wasn't
holding an axe, and made obscene gestures at the black thorn symbol on
his chest.

Ignoring the question of whether the hidden existence could sense or see
him, Lumian felt that the problem wouldn't deteriorate any further,
given that he had already fallen into a time loop thanks to Him, and the
people around him were becoming stranger and more dangerous.

After watching the dance for the third time, Lumian rubbed his somewhat
empty head and left the ruins to return to his home on the other side of
the wilderness, enduring the slight warmth in his chest.

Before leaving the dream, he attempted to consolidate the dance
movements he had memorized and almost sprained his back, broke his knee
ligaments and tore his calf muscles.

"Dogshit, this isn't something an ordinary human can do!" Lumian cursed
and lay on the bed.

As his spirituality was greatly drained, he quickly fell asleep.

___

As Lumian awoke, the sky was just beginning to lighten. The sun had yet
to rise, and the crimson moon had lost its luster.

He sat up slowly, feeling the satisfaction of a deep sleep. His
exhausted spirituality had been perfectly replenished.

Walking to the window, Lumian drew back the curtains, allowing the light
of dawn to flood the room.

In the next moment, his eyes were fixed on the figure larger than an
ordinary owl, perched on an elm tree not far away, staring down at him.

Lumian quickly snapped out of his daze and opened his mouth.

"Aurore! Aurore!"

*The suspect is here!*

*Quick, follow it!*

Upon hearing the shout, the owl unfurled its wings and soared towards
the edge of the village.

It gradually descended and vanished into the forest bordering Cordu
Village.

Aurore, dressed in a white silk nightgown, entered Lumian's bedroom
seconds later, her face contorted in irritation.

"Is it that owl again?"

Lumian gazed out of the window and replied, "Yes. Did White Paper manage
to follow it?"

Aurore pulled at her long blonde tresses and spat, "Why does it always
appear at such ungodly hours? I was sound asleep when you woke me up. By
the time I could release White Paper, it had flown away."

Lumian shot back, "But you said you couldn't sleep well with something
on your mind."

Aurore rolled her eyes at him and sneered, "Humans tend to feel nervous,
uneasy, and fearful at the beginning. Once they get used to it, they
become numb to it. Only by sleeping well can they remain alert and
rational. If you don't sleep well, it will affect your mental state and
signs of losing control will surface."

Lumian's expression was remorseful as he said, "We can only wait for the
next time."

After a moment of contemplation, Aurore suggested, "Let's try to
identify a pattern in its appearances. We can't keep waiting around all
the time. We need to rest and cannot be on guard constantly."

Lumian reminisced about the first few sightings.

"It's always in the latter half of the night and early morning hours..."

"Why only during that period?" Aurore inquired further. "It seems more
like an act than a pattern. Think carefully. Did you do anything or
repeat the same actions on the corresponding nights when it appeared in
the first half of the night?"

"I was exploring the dream ruins," Lumian admitted to his sister as he
began to recall. "Before it first appeared, I killed the first monster
in the dream. Before it appeared the second time, I activated the symbol
on my chest through Cogitation and discovered what was special about me.
The third time, I consumed the potion in the dream and became a Hunter.
The fourth time, which is today, I discovered a way to activate my
specialness in the dream to a certain extent while incurring less
damage."

"How did you do it?" Aurore asked eagerly.

Lumian recounted Noodle Man's dance and his attempt.

As Aurore listened, she thought about the owl. After her brother
finished speaking, she deliberated and said, "The owl's visits seem to
be related to significant progress in your exploration of the dream."

*Uh...* Lumian thought for a moment before his eyes lit up.

"Indeed!

"The first time I killed a monster, the first time I displayed my
specialness, the first time I consumed a potion and stepped onto the
Beyonder path, the first time I found a way to make use of that
specialness...

"Similar major developments also have a certain reaction in reality.
That owl sensed it and came over to observe? Heh, it smelled something."

Aurore tersely acknowledged.

"In the future, we can deliberately create a similar opportunity to see
if we can wait for that owl."

"I believe the next time it appears is after I master the mysterious
dance and can truly use the specialness brought about by the symbol on
my chest in my dream," Lumian pondered, revealing a malicious smile.
"When the time comes, I'll inform you before entering the dream. Be
prepared."

Aurore thought for a moment and nodded.

"I hope to figure out who the owl is related to and what role it plays
in Cordu's abnormality."

Lumian seized the opportunity to inquire, "Aurore, uh, Grande Soeur, do
you possess any knowledge about that particular dance? As you are aware,
my understanding of mysticism is still rudimentary."

Aurore dragged a chair in front of Lumian's wooden table and settled in.
After pondering for a moment, she responded, "Several notebooks have
alluded to the existence of large-scale ritualistic magic during the
early Fifth Epoch and throughout the Fourth Epoch."

"Those rituals entailed not only numerous sacrifices but also a
multitude of participants. They employed specific dances to appease
their desired entities in exchange for a response."

"In essence, it was a form of sacrificial ritual and magic. Dancing,
from the outset, was believed to influence nature and facilitate
communication with deities. Its effects resemble those of Beyonder
language and the combination of herbs, essential oils, and other
ingredients."

In Aurore and Lumian's world, history was divided into five epochs. The
First Epoch was the Chaos Epoch, followed by the Dark Epoch, and then
the Cataclysm Epoch. However, Aurore had heard from a pen pal that the
Cataclysm Epoch was also known as the Glorious Epoch.

The Fourth Epoch was the Age of the Gods, or the Epoch of the Gods. The
Fifth Epoch was the present day, which began 1,358 years ago and was
referred to as the Iron Age.

Of the five epochs, the history of the first three remained
unverifiable, with only myths and legends surviving. The Fourth Epoch
occasionally yielded documents, information, notebooks, ruins,
mausoleums, ancient cities, and so on. Nevertheless, history seemed
shrouded in a thick fog, with only a faint outline discernible. The
theological texts of the seven Churches often recounted stories from the
Fourth Epoch, which served as the only source of illumination.

After listening to his sister's explanation, Lumian hazarded a guess.

"That Noodle Man employs dance to appease the hidden entity that
corresponds to the thorn symbol. Is it hoping to elicit a response or a
boon?

"Perhaps a significant portion of its ritual is absent, resulting in an
extremely weak effect. Or is the problem with the dream ruins causing a
failure that can only trigger a tiny fraction of the power contained in
the symbol within my body?"

"Heh heh, it's as if I'm a god. Having witnessed Noodle Man's dance and
being pleased by it, I decided to highlight the symbol and offer a
certain response."

However, Lumian had no control over this. It was an automatic reaction
of the thorn symbol.

Aurore smiled and replied, "You are more like a carrier of that symbol,
a tool, in a sense."

She paused thoughtfully and said, "I suspect that the dance was
specifically invented to please or communicate with the hidden entity
that corresponds to the thorn symbol. Otherwise, it wouldn't have
elicited a reaction from the symbol...

"Furthermore, based on your description, this is not something an
ordinary person can accomplish. Only Beyonders with special enhancements
can do so.

"Although I am familiar with the names of the corresponding Sequence 9
and Sequence 8 pathways, I have a certain level of understanding of
them. None of them can execute that kind of dance, and Noodle Man's
performance does not seem like that of a higher Sequence. Otherwise, you
would not have been able to escape."

"Perhaps it is not from the 22 pathways, but rather a boon from a hidden
entity?" Lumian recalled the mysterious lady's words.

Aurore looked out the window and pursed her lips.

"I wonder if this has anything to do with the Circle Inhabitant or a
power equivalent to Sequence 9 or Sequence 8?"

"Probably." Lumian suddenly laughed. "Let me name it. Noodle Man, Circle
Inhabitant's corresponding Sequence 9!"

Aurore couldn't help but look up at the ceiling.

The siblings chatted for a while before heading downstairs for
breakfast.

After studying Hermes until past ten, Lumian departed with important
items.
