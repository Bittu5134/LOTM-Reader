## Chapter 308: Incomprehensible Choice

The plump, middle-aged Anthony Reid found himself taken aback. But after
a brief moment, he grinned in a self-deprecating way and uttered, "I was
so rattled that I couldn't even judge the authenticity of that sentence.
As anticipated, a Spectator must take a seat in the audience."

Lumian remained calmly seated, his smile unwavering.

"No, it's not that simple. Why did I leap off the barstool? Why did I
murmur into your ear from behind? My aim was to shield you from my
subtle expressions and involuntary body language. In those moments, your
emotions were already stirred, blurring your ability to decipher my true
intent."

A short pause followed Anthony Reid's contemplative silence, then he
spoke,

"That's one reason. Another lies in your characteristic demeanor. I
don't know if you've caught on, but you tend to put on a bit of a show,
appear nonchalant, or in modern terms, act cool.

"Just then, I believed those actions, given the circumstances, were in
line with your usual behavior, aimed at lending weight to your words.
So, suspicion didn't even cross my mind."

A chuckle escaped Lumian's lips.

"It's only natural for a lad like me to yearn for a touch of coolness, a
bit of swagger. It also conveniently masks my true motives. Actually,
both are genuine. That's why they remain impervious to scrutiny."

It was akin to him having Fire Ravens circling him with one hand in his
pocket, unleashing them on his adversaries as he advanced. First, it was
undeniably cool, and second, he seized the chance to grasp Mr. K's
finger to avert any potential mishaps.

Anthony Reid pondered momentarily before nodding.

"Only a superficial motive, steeped in authenticity, can truly deceive a
Spectator."

Raising his right foot over his left knee, Lumian steered the
conversation back on track.

"Our journey to unveil the people and forces behind Hugues Artois hasn't
yet commenced, as we are engaged in more pressing matters. But fear not,
we shall delve into this matter next week. We possess the relevant
sources of information as well."

Lumian's strategy involved Jenna delving deeper into Hugues Artois's
background through the Purifiers, exploring ways she could "assist."

As the one responsible for Hugues Artois's demise, it was logical for
Jenna to keep tabs on the investigation's progress, hoping to unearth
all details without arousing the official Beyonders' suspicion. These
thoughts and tendencies were inherent in Jenna, so Lumian didn't need to
fuel them further. Just a reminder would suffice.

In due course, the Purifiers could subtly guide Jenna and her companions
toward actions they might find inconvenient. This would undeniably
supply Anthony Reid's investigation with invaluable leads.

Anthony Reid's deep brown eyes mirrored Lumian's figure as he absorbed
the discourse in silence.

The information broker offered an almost imperceptible nod.

"I'll stay a while longer."

*Engaging with Spectators of the Beyonder path is straightforward.
There's no need to concoct another tale or search for an excuse to sway
him. He can ascertain the truth for himself...* Lumian flashed a
grin and gestured toward the bed. "Take a seat."

This way, he needn't expose Jenna's true identity or her role as a
Purifier informant.

Anthony Reid stood near the door, rooted in place, and spoke, "You've
more or less sussed out what's happened to me. Is there something else
you want me to add?"

"I'd prefer a more detailed account," Lumian responded without much
ceremony.

Having been through the Poison Spur Mob, the Bliss Society, the Cordu
catastrophe, Ruhr and Michel's deaths, and the explosion at the
Goodville Chemical Factory, Lumian found the evil gods and their minions
abnormally repulsive. His casual demeanor had been replaced by a
newfound seriousness.

Once, he'd believed that people could fancy whatever beliefs they
pleased---that it didn't concern him. Now, his perspective had entirely
changed. He held that only heretics who'd gone to their grave were the
good ones. The living ones were ticking time bombs of doom, liable to
unleash havoc on him and his companions sooner or later.

So, he wasn't just spinning tales for Anthony Reid. He truly planned on
delving into Hugues Artois' affairs and uncovering more of those
heretics when he could spare a moment.

Moreover, this could endear him to Mr. K and the Aurora Order.

Of course, it did seem quite odd for a wanted mob leader to be lending a
hand to the authorities in taking down cultists.

Anthony Reid's expression darkened as he said, "Towards the end of the
war with the Loen Kingdom, my comrades and I were stationed at a vital
route in the northern foothills of the Hornacis mountain range. Our
commanding officer was Major Hugues Artois.

"We were split into three companies, each at different positions. We
were to prevent small Loen Kingdom Beyonder teams from crossing the
treacherous path and attacking us from the rear, as well as defend
against direct assaults.

"That night, gunshots and cannon fire suddenly shattered my sleep. I
watched as my comrades were torn apart, one by one, from behind. Their
heads exploding, bodies rent asunder. The earth became a sea of
blood..."

At this point, Anthony Reid's breath quickened, as if he was reliving
the trauma.

He paused for a moment before continuing, "In the midst of that war, I
had a fortuitous encounter that pushed my Sequence upward. I never
reported it to Hugues Artois. Using my newfound abilities, I managed to
break through the encirclement with four wounded comrades and retreated.

"Two of them were gravely hurt and were left behind on the mountain path
for---forever. I can still see their pained and angry gazes.

"At first, I thought maybe one of the other positions had been
compromised, or that Loen's airships had dropped troops behind us under
cover of darkness. But later, I realized that the reason was that Hugues
Artois's company had chosen to retreat without informing us, after
encountering only a probing attack!"

Lumian pondered for a moment before replying, "When Hugues Artois
ordered the retreat, didn't those soldiers question it? Didn't they try
to get word to the other two positions?"

"Hugues Artois was our commanding officer, and he knew how to give
rousing speeches. Plus, he had a warrant supposedly signed by General
Philip," Anthony Reid said, his expression grim. "The soldiers back then
assumed he had already passed on orders to the other positions. I still
can't wrap my head around why he'd sacrifice us. It wouldn't have taken
much time or caused him any harm."

"Maybe he was overwhelmed and forgot," Lumian suggested, not out to
defend the late Hugues Artois, merely offering a possible explanation.

Anthony Reid shook his head.

"He wasn't a green recruit on his first battlefield. He had proven his
mettle in prior fights, showed his leadership under duress."

Lumian didn't delve further, allowing Anthony Reid to continue.

"Once we found out the truth, the three of us fought to bring Hugues
Artois to military court, but it was futile. They'd simply tell us that
imagination wasn't evidence.

"Helpless, we watched Hugues Artois shift into politics after the war
and rise through the ranks.

"My other two comrades were frail to start with. They passed away
burdened by fury and pain. When Hugues Artois threw his hat in the ring
for the Enlightenment Party in the market district's parliamentary
election, I ended up here."

Lumian nodded slightly and inquired, "Being an information broker,
that's to hide your true identity?"

"No, I've been scraping by as an information broker for a few years
now," Anthony Reid replied with a wry smile. "Plus, this cover helps me
dig deeper into Hugues Artois' dealings."

"Any breakthroughs?" Lumian asked naturally.

Anthony Reid's expression darkened as he answered, "Hugues Artois' foray
into politics seems unremarkable. He rode General Philip's coattails and
climbed the ladder. His eloquence caught the eye of several senior
Enlightenment Party MPs. And he forged ties with a handful of ex-noble
families."

"Is General Philip a concern?" Lumian queried, straightforward as ever.

Anthony Reid sighed slowly, his voice heavy, "The general met his end
before I could investigate him. Official word is---illness took him."

Lumian posed a few more questions before saying, "I'll catch up with you
when I've got more to share."

"Sure." Anthony Reid understood Lumian's sincerity.

After departing Auberge du Coq Doré, Lumian made his way back to the
safe house on Rue des Blouses Blanches. He swung open the iron cabinet,
retrieving a hefty stack of information concerning the denizens of the
spirit world.

Within the assortment, he discovered a notebook labeled 'Sights in the
Spirit World.' Flipping through a couple of pages, he could feel a surge
of frustration and anxiety creeping into his mind.

His immediate aim wasn't to grasp the intricacies of the spirit world,
but rather to pinpoint suitable creatures from that realm. Thus, he
closed the notebook and delved into the introductions of the various
spirit world entities.

Somewhat inexplicably, after poring over the pages for over half an
hour, Lumian sensed his mental energy draining away. His thoughts seemed
to evaporate, forcing him to bring his study session to an abrupt close.
He sprawled out on the bed, drifting into slumber.

Early the next morning, Lumian arrived at Apartment 601, 3 Rue des
Blouses Blanches, and rang the doorbell.

Franca had already risen from her sleep, attired in her customary shirt
and breeches. She directed her gaze towards Lumian and inquired, "What
brings you here so early?"

Lumian's eyes flicked towards Jenna, who occupied the living room, a
smile tugging at his lips.

"Isn't today the day Jenna advances to being an Instigator? I'm here to
witness the moment."

A frown played across Franca's features as she muttered, "You seem quite
concerned about her."

"Absolutely," Lumian affirmed, his grin widening. "Once she's an
Instigator, she can aid me in dealing with Guillaume Bénet. While I
can't exactly count on her for a direct confrontation, she'll excel at
launching sneak attacks and surveying the surroundings to forestall any
potential mishaps."

Jenna emitted a derisive snort, while Franca offered a mix of
exasperation and amusement through a tongue click. "Your words are like
honey."

"The kind that's already been digested?" Lumian chuckled, his
self-awareness evident.
