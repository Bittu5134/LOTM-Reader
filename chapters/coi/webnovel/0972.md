## Chapter 972: Demoness's Method

"Treat An Xiaotian by finding a bestowed of the Great Mother through
Lumian?" Franca's thoughts began to wander, gradually becoming more
far-fetched. "If that doesn't work, then have An Xiaotian conceive a
child, with the child replacing the father, becoming the father, and
help that child grow rapidly, one day surpassing others' ten years..."

Jenna remained silent for a few seconds before saying, "With everyone
suppressed at Sequence 7, the Great Mother's bestowed probably can't
make embryos form quickly or children grow rapidly. They're even hoping
to rely on the Child of God's godhood to make Li Keji go through the
pregnancy and childbirth process in one month.

"Moreover, if the Great Mother takes the opportunity to corrupt An
Xiaotian or his child, symbolically speaking, the severity of the
problem might not be less than the Celestial Worthy awakening."

Franca sighed and replied, "Indeed, but there's no other way. If we
could wake An Xiaotian up and reshoot 'The Great Pirate 3', it might
have unexpected effects."

Jenna tersely acknowledged. "Madam Justice said that ever since An
Xiaotian became a vegetable and 'The Great Pirate 3' changed its lead
actor, the filming became normal. She suspects that from that moment on,
the true goal this movie was meant to achieve was destined to fail.

"Unfortunately, at present, there's no hope of An Xiaotian waking up,
and we can't find anyone more suitable to play Gehrman Sparrow."

Franca opened her mouth, showing a thoughtful expression. "Actually,
there's a better candidate, someone more suitable than An Xiaotian to
play Gehrman Sparrow."

"Who?" Jenna asked in surprise.

*The Major Arcana card holders hadn't discovered such a person?*

Franca's eyes curved slightly as she smiled. "Zhou Mingrui."

"..." Jenna felt a bit stupid.

*Is that even allowed?*

*What would you call this? Having Zhou Mingrui play Zhou Mingrui,
letting Zhou Mingrui awaken Zhou Mingrui!*

Franca said seriously, "If Zhou Mingrui plays Gehrman Sparrow, he could
relive the life he's forgotten during the filming process. He might
actually remember something and eventually immerse himself in the role,
becoming one with the character. Wouldn't that be equivalent to The
World awakening?"

At this point, Franca smacked her lips. "But the difficulty is too high.
We don't have the money to reshoot 'The Great Pirate 3', nor can we
convince Hall Film Company. If they were to shoot anything, it would be
'The Great Pirate 4', not Gehrman Sparrow's maritime adventure story.

"Even if you became a top star in the entertainment industry and
actively proposed reshooting this movie, and even if someone invested,
convincing Zhou Mingrui to film would be extremely difficult. Not to
mention his personal willingness, I estimate that as soon as the
invitation is extended, the relevant person would be kicked out of the
dream. Whoever dares to discuss this matter would be kicked out."

"This can be considered as an alternative plan for future awakening
actions..." Jenna felt a headache coming on as she thought about the
troubles Franca mentioned.

Franca nodded thoughtfully. "Correspondingly, Zhou Mingrui's memories
don't seem to be erased. As long as he knows about being asked to film
'The Great Pirate 3' and is interested and willing to try, the Celestial
Worthy probably can't directly prevent it. For this, we can sacrifice
multiple members' chances to enter the dream multiple times..."

At this point, Franca suddenly smiled. "What do you call this? It's
called 'For the sake of saving the world, please debut Mr. Fool!'"

"The Celestial Worthy might not be able to directly prevent it, but
subsequently, there might be incidents like the director having a car
accident, the film crew experiencing a fire, or the female lead's
reputation collapsing, preventing 'The Great Pirate 3' from even
entering the filming process," Jenna calmly reminded.

Franca sighed. "I know, this is just proposing an idea. We'll see if
it's feasible later."

†

The next afternoon, in the administrative department of the Tech
Building.

Franca was busy making charts when she suddenly saw Luo Shan, who had
just been called to the HR department, return with a dejected and
confused expression.

"What's wrong?" Franca stopped typing.

Luo Shan spoke as if in a dream. "They want to fire me.

"HR said that Mr. Huang passed by earlier, saw me slacking off, and got
very angry. He plans to fire me directly...

"I-I haven't even finished paying off my mortgage..."

*What kind of reason is this? There are at least seventeen or eighteen
people in the administrative department who slack off more than Luo
Shan, why fire only her?* Franca's first reaction was to help
Luo Shan seek justice.

Her second reaction was: *Dammit, is this Mr. Huang's purge of Zhou
Mingrui's friends?*

*Has the mirrored Roselle completed initial control over Mr.
Huang?*

*Has Zaratulstra targeted Luo Shan because of her previous warning to
Zhou Mingrui?*

*If Luo Shan doesn't commute with me, the Mirror Substitution won't be
able to work, unless Jenna follows her all the time, but Jenna might
soon receive a contract from Hall Film Company...*

*This way, Luo Shan would be in danger...*

Before Franca could comfort Luo Shan and think of a countermeasure, she
heard her phone vibrate.

She picked it up and saw it was a friend request on WeChat.

The requester was: "Bernadette."

*Queen Mystic has arrived? Talk about a stroke of luck!* Franca
quickly accepted the request, then said to Luo Shan, "Don't worry, there
aren't many people working in the administrative department anyway. When
Mr. Ed comes, you can plead your case to him, and he should be able to
persuade Mr. Huang.

"If that doesn't work, try to negotiate for higher severance pay."

*And I will seek justice for you from Miss Huang!*

"Mm-hmm." Luo Shan walked back to her desk, dejectedly waiting for Mr.
Ed to appear.

Meanwhile, Franca received a message from Bernadette: "Come to Room 101
on the 8th floor."

*8th floor? That doesn't belong to any of the Intis Group companies...
However, according to Lumian's interpretation, the companies on those
floors symbolize the erosion and influence of different secret
organizations and evil god cults on Intis, including Queen Mystic's
Element Dawn...* Franca stood up, didn't say anything to Deputy
Director Zhang Qing, and used going to the bathroom as an excuse to
leave the administrative department and take the elevator down to the
8th floor.

Half of the 8th floor belonged to Dawn Children's Publishing Company.
The receptionist didn't even glance at Franca, allowing her to enter.

Franca found that the facial recognition access control wasn't
activated, and no employees came out along the way, allowing her to
easily reach Room 101.

Bernie Huang, wearing a spaghetti strap top with fringes at the hem and
long jeans, sat in the sofa area, exuding a youthful aura.

*This is the college student version of Queen Mystic...* Franca
walked over, greeted her, and sat down.

"What happened?" Bernie Huang's demeanor and posture were different from
that of a college student.

Franca recounted how Mr. Huang seemed to be able to sense the gaze from
within the mirror, how the mirrored Roselle in the real world appeared
to be missing, and how Zaratulstra had been spending several hours with
Mr. Huang every day recently.

Finally, she mentioned the trouble Luo Shan had encountered.

Bernie Huang listened quietly, then nodded gently.

"Regarding my father, I will observe and probe. This will take some
time, maybe a few days, maybe a week or two.

"As for Luo Shan's problem, you'll have to solve it yourselves. If I
intervene on Luo Shan's behalf, it could easily expose my connection
with you.

"If you can resolve Luo Shan's trouble, at least prevent her from
entering the handover process for a week, I'll give you a reward."

*Isn't this our business? Why are you still paying me as a reward? It's
me asking for your help, not you asking for mine...* Franca
instantly recalled the Star Dream Provisions Store incident and roughly
understood that Queen Mystic was finding reasons and excuses to give
money to her and the others.

"Alright," Franca agreed immediately.

After leaving Room 101, on her way back upstairs, she seriously
considered how to prevent Luo Shan from being fired.

*Instigate Mr. Ed to plead on her behalf? That only has a certain chance
of success...*

*Make Mr. Huang's decision to fire Luo Shan disappear? I can't do that,
but I can find a way to delay it for a few days...*

*Pursue both approaches simultaneously...*

Franca, always capable of thinking out of the box, took out her phone
and told Lumian her ideas and the potential aftermath issues.

Soon, she received a reply from The Idiot: "Plausible."

Franca immediately deleted the chat history using the Information
Shredder and then returned to the administrative department.

When Mr. Ed entered his office, she stood up and accompanied Luo Shan to
plead their case, spreading mystical pathogens along the way.

Yes, she was going to spread a disease.

She chose mystical pathogens that gave people a chance to get some sick
leave, something they could recover quickly upon returning home!

Mystical pathogens that caused stomach flu!

After nearly ten minutes, Franca discreetly Instigated Mr. Ed, making
him agree to plead on Luo Shan's behalf.

After the two left the director's office, they saw many colleagues
looking pale, vomiting into nearby trash cans, while others rushed to
the bathrooms on different floors.

"What's wrong?" Luo Shan asked a colleague with concern.

The male colleague, holding his stomach, said, "I don't know, everyone
suddenly started vomiting and having diarrhea. Could it be food
poisoning?"

Seeing this, Franca urgently called the police and dialed the emergency
number for Crimson Moon Hospital.

While the administrative department staff waited for the ambulances and
other department staff came to help, Franca covered her mouth and
started dry heaving.

"I've been affected too..." she said to Luo Shan.

Luo Shan assessed her own physical condition. "I feel it a little, but
I'm okay."

Soon, ambulances from Crimson Moon Hospital arrived and took the
affected administrative department staff to the hospital.

The entire administrative department was suddenly left with only four
people, one of whom was Luo Shan.

Mr. Ed looked at Luo Shan, his expression grave, and said, "You hold
down the fort for now. Don't worry about the firing."

"Okay." Luo Shan was both confused and bewildered.

From earlier, Lumian, as a security guard, had been running up and down,
helping the administrative department staff go to Crimson Moon Hospital.

During this process, he found an opportunity to get close to Franca, and
they exchanged a glance.

As agreed, Lumian spread the mystical pathogen causing stomach flu to
Franca, in case she went to the hospital later and nothing was found,
making her a suspect.

"How did they get food poisoning?" Old Xia looked at the departing
vehicles and asked confusedly, "Everyone ate at the same cafeteria,
didn't they? Did they order some unclean takeout?"

"Who knows," Lumian said as he turned to walk back, receiving a message
from Franca.

The message read: "You can go check out the administrative department.
Those who can still maintain some health and continue working are likely
to be Beyonders, like Luo Shan."
