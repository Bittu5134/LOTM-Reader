## Chapter 1156: The Battle of Consciousness

Taking advantage of the malevolent dragon's scattered consciousness and
unformed spirit, Lumian, who had just engaged in battle using the ritual
and The Fool Klein's reality-bending ability, rapidly expanded his
figure, "summoning" his physical body from within the protected zone.

Almost simultaneously, Klein in the astral world created an opening in
the grayish-white fog that blanketed the Western Continent.

With the Mother Goddess of Depravity fully accommodating the Brood Hive,
even if the seal on the Western Continent were completely lifted, She
would not currently destroy the continent. However, Her symbolic
influence and natural power would still radiate outward, so Klein
maintained the seal, merely opening a "door" that connected the interior
to the outside for Lumian.

Lumian, now three-headed and six-armed, shot out of the protected zone
and Teleported himself to the depths of the grayish-white fog, appearing
above the dragon-sealing well.

He dove in, arriving beside his consciousness and spirit.

The two instantly overlapped.

Lumian grew immensely large, his three heads gazing in different
directions while all six arms were raised.

Leaping out of the now-unsealed dragon-sealing well, he hovered above
the bustling metropolis. Stretching his hands downward, he pulled at
something heavy from a distance.

The people within the city suddenly felt the sky darken, and the ground
trembled noticeably.

An image of the city was forcibly extracted by Lumian from its physical
form. Within this image, the citizens were grotesque---some were reduced
to a single head dragging a bloody, skeletal spine; others were
well-dressed but headless; and some were swollen, their features
obscured...

This was originally intertwined with the actual metropolis, with secret
doors and intersecting timelines connecting the two---

the City of Calamity!

Lumian's massive body sank abruptly, plunging into the extracted image
of the city.

The City of Calamity shrank rapidly and bizarrely, entering Lumian's
body and swiftly moving toward his brow.

Lumian intended to seize the moment, before the malevolent dragon's
consciousness was fully reborn, to forcibly accommodate the City of
Calamity---and then confront and merge with it!

The next second, the city's image froze at Lumian's brow.

His consciousness and spirit were immediately drawn into it.

He saw a staircase ascending to infinite heights, at the end of which
lay a divine throne stained with dark red blood. On the steps, the
dragon's body quickly took form, coiling to block his path forward.

___

In the real world.

Deep within the blood-red full moon, the pounding heartbeat grew intense
again.

The nest-like peaks seemed to resonate, their sinking accelerating.

The accomodation of the Mother Goddess of Depravity with the Brood Hive
progressed further, showing no signs of slowing.

Within the grayish-white fog directly beneath the blood-red moon, the
"Madames" and "Ladies" under the core power of the Mother Goddess of
Depravity stood one after another, turning their gaze toward their
leader.

This figure, a beautiful woman with a full-moon-like face radiating
maternal glory, spoke to her companions,

"We must return to the embrace of the Mother.

"She has mobilized more of the Chaos Primogenitor's power to accelerate
Her fusion with the Brood Hive. We must return to Her embrace, restore
Her power, and help alleviate Her burden."

Seeing confusion on their faces, the woman added,

"The Chaos Primogenitor is the Original Sin of the universe. Although
merely Sequence 0 of the Valley God pathway, It carries significant
symbolism.

"That symbolism represents the nascent, Original Creator of the next
universe. Nurturing It is one of the Mother's most vital symbols and a
key reason She remains a Pillar even after the Brood Hive's separation.

"Even as a Mother, She cannot overly wield Its symbolic powers without
risking instability or further complications."

Understanding dawned on the Ladies and Madames, their expressions
reflecting varying degrees of reverence born of the knowledge imparted.

Together, they chanted in unison,

"Praise be to you, Mother of All Things!

"Praise be to you, Eternal Evil!

"Praise be to you, the True Great Mother Goddess!"

Amidst their praises, these bestowed and Beyonders transformed into
beams of red, black, or brown light, streaming one after another into
the blood-red moon and merging with it.

___

A hidden corner of the World of Ruins' South Continent.

The bizarrely shaped Rose School of Thought Beyonders and Mother Tree of
Desire followers flocked densely near an altar, their numbers
overwhelming.

Atop the yellow, pyramid-like altar, a figure wrapped in bandages,
thorns, and roses hung motionlessly, appearing to bind all curses and
desires---on the verge of erupting.

Chained God Tolzna.

Following the Vortex incident and the descent of the crimson moon, this
deity had effectively perished. His body, consciousness, and spirit were
entirely corrupted by the Mother Tree of Desire, acting as Her proxy.

Now, He would serve as the primary sacrifice for this ritual, forcibly
opening a passage with the Mother Goddess of Depravity's aid to allow
the Mother Tree of Desire to descend within the barrier. Of course, if
the barrier shattered under the Mother Goddess's assault, It would
simply return directly to the great existence, the Mother Tree of
Desire.

When the sacrifices were ready, the thoughts of Suah and Tirié radiated
outward from in front of the Chained God.

"The ritual!

"Begin the ritual!"

___

Within the consciousness space corresponding to the City of Calamity.

Seeing the malevolent dragon's body rapidly forming, the three-headed,
six-armed Lumian suddenly disassembled.

He split into six consciousnesses and six figures.

These included his primary consciousness, Aurore's consciousness,
Jenna's consciousness, the dull and unresponsive chaotic vortex
consciousness, Primordial Demoness Cheek's consciousness, and Blood
Emperor Alista Tudor's consciousness.

Though not entirely fused, they had partially merged, cooperating,
conflicting, or entangling to form a fragile balance---while portions
corresponding to Omebella and Zedus had fully integrated with Cheek and
Tudor, becoming indistinguishable.

In the real world, Lumian could not break this balance or separate these
distinct consciousnesses. However, in this space, where they had a
degree of independence, they could unite or divide.

If Lumian succeeded in accommodating the City of Calamity, his
consciousness would eventually form a unified whole---indivisible, even
under similar circumstances.

This was the distinction between dual-pathway true gods and great
existences.

The six consciousnesses coalesced instantly. Lumian pulled the
statue-like chaotic vortex face consciousness, along with Aurore's and
Jenna's consciousnesses, a step back, disappearing from the dragon's
impending attack. This left only Primordial Demoness Cheek and Blood
Emperor Alista Tudor in place.

Cheek gazed deeply into the Blood Emperor's eyes, then fixated longingly
on the dragon, as if saying: Finally, this moment has come.

Behind Her appeared a figure clad in a black skeletal dress---the
mirrored Oldest One's feminine aspect.

Similarly, behind Blood Emperor Alista Tudor, the mirrored Oldest One's
masculine aspect emerged, clad in white armor.

In the real world, these figures were forbidden from meeting or merging.
But in the consciousness space, Cheek and Tudor could briefly reunite,
provided Lumian withdrew the chaotic vortex consciousness.

This reunion could only occur once, as it would severely wound both
Cheek and Tudor. Left unchecked, it could lead to the true birth of the
mirrored Oldest One's consciousness.

Lumian was now gambling on this symbolism to counter the dragon's
consciousness, seizing every moment!

Instantly, the malevolent dragon's consciousness transformed the space
into an infinite, dark cosmos filled with scattered calamities.

Cheek and Tudor drew close, accompanied by their mirrored forms.

The entire "universe" froze, all calamities losing their vitality, their
light and heat extinguished, plunging into total silence.

Then, the most violent explosion erupted. Massive amounts of matter
scattered outward, forming stars, suns, seas, and various lifeforms.

The malevolent dragon's consciousness dissolved in the prior "freeze"
and was shattered amidst the current "creation," reforming into
disparate entities.

Once again, It dissipated, reconstituting within the City of Calamity,
where It would recover before long.

The figures of Cheek and Tudor merged into a single sphere, twisting and
writhing as They struggled to fully integrate.

At this moment, a chaotic vortex face emerged from within, separating
Them into four positions---north, south, east, and west.

Annihilation and creation became unstable.

The next second, Lumian, Aurore, and Jenna returned, towering as giants.
They forcibly dragged the weakly reborn malevolent dragon's
consciousness close to them.

Under these circumstances, the chaotic head of the malevolent dragon and
the chaotic vortex face became strongly attracted, exerting a powerful
pull toward convergence.

They originated from the same place---they were one to begin with!

The chaotic vortex face and chaotic head merged, drawing each other to a
central point to fully unite.

This act separated Cheek and Tudor, including Their mirrored forms.

The instability of annihilation and creation ceased abruptly.

Having finally prevented the true birth of the mirrored Original
Creator's consciousness, Lumian, Aurore, and Jenna were forced to return
to the body containing the chaotic vortex face.

In doing so, they and the malevolent dragon were now inseparably close,
breathing audible, forms distinct.

Neither could evade. Neither could retreat!
