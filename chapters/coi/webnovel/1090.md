## Chapter 1090: Pillars

Madam Magician seemed to understand The Chariot Lumian's current
feelings and chuckled. "When the Original Creator split Himself, He also
wanted to reunite and complete His revival. For this purpose, He left
behind a barrier to protect the planet we live on.

"Without this barrier, those Great Old Dominators would have destroyed
us along with the entire world long ago. By the way, try not to mention
the cosmos to people without an Angel's status, or rather, don't let
them understand the true situation of the cosmos---the Outer Deities
come from there.

"Well, the Original Creator's will is gradually fading with time, and
power and psyche without will become chaotic and problematic. The
barrier formed from this will end up increasingly unable to resist the
great existences, until it reaches a critical point and completely
shatters under the horrifying pressure.

"According to different prophecies and previous patterns, this critical
point will arrive in 1368---this is the essence of the apocalypse.

"However, from the current situation, the apocalypse may not wait until
the critical point appears. Problems within the barrier might cause the
passageways to open prematurely."

The Chariot Lumian nodded slightly, finally understanding completely why
there would be an apocalypse and what the main dangers would be when it
arrived.

When the barrier shatters, even if Mr. Fool fully awakens and replaces
The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings to become a great
existence, their planet would only have one Above the Sequences being
who could fight against the Great Old Ones, while there were a full ten
Outer Deities in outer space!

What could the true gods use to stop the remaining nine?

Even counting the high-level beings like the Celestial Master from the
Western Continent, and assuming everyone could truly work together,
there would only be a dozen or so true gods within the barrier.

This would be like a dozen Sequence 1 angels trying to stop nine
Sequence 0 true gods---it would be extremely impressive if they could
hold back even two for a short time, while the others would be
unstoppable.

"In the Vortex incident, the deity worshiped by the Aurora Order, with
the help of Amon consuming Termiboros and the Genie's special nature and
other arrangements, severely wounded the Uncertain Mist and killed all
the Brokers. This is a good thing." Madam Magician suddenly smiled. "The
Great Old Ones waiting to invade from different planets in the solar
system have lost one of Their number, and the remaining ones can no
longer be effectively united. The bad news is that after such careful
planning and great effort, there are still nine Outer Deities left."

Lumian already had some understanding of the final outcome and general
development of the Vortex incident, but it wasn't entirely clear.

Now, he finally understood what all those arrangements were for.

He remained silent for a few seconds before repeating one of his
previous questions, "Besides the Mother Goddess of Depravity and Mother
Tree of Desire, what are the other seven Great Old Ones trying to
achieve?"

Mr. Fool had mentioned earlier that accommodating multiple sefirot was
impossible for the Celestial Worthy, although He had indeed done so.
From the subsequent narrative, it seemed that the Celestial Worthy's
ultimate fall was somehow related to this.

Madam Magician glanced at the bronze long table in front of Mr. Fool,
and seeing no objection from this great existence, she carefully said,
"There are actually different levels for Above the Sequences.

"The Mother Tree of Desire, Monarch of Decay, and other Great Old
Dominators are at the first level. Besides Them, there are some other
Outer Deities in the depths of cosmos, but They are either weaker in
strength or have no desire for the symbolic meanings of the sefirot
within the barrier, so They aren't involved in this matter.

"The Original Creator is at the third level, representing the ultimate,
representing chaos, beginning and end, representing the unknowable and
undiscussable. No existence can surpass this level, and this level can
only have one being, and it's very unstable because both aggregation and
division are His instincts.

"Between the first and third levels, there's another level---the second
level.

"The great existences at the second level aren't much more powerful than
the strongest first-level Great Old Ones like the Mother Tree of Desire,
Son of Chaos, and Monarch of Decay, but They possess special symbolism.
They are the foundation for the universe's maintenance and development,
each supporting a realm, and are known as 'Pillars.'"

"Pillars..." Lumian thought of the "Ten Pillars" of the Moses Ascetic
Order.

Madam Magician Fors said with undisguised amusement, "This is a case of
knowing the term 'Pillars' but not understanding its true symbolic
meaning. They thought it sounded sophisticated and misused it. In the
eyes of those who truly understand the weight of 'Pillars,' it's simply
foolish."

At this point, Madam Magician paused. "From the establishment of the
Moses Ascetic Order until Mr. Fool's initial awakening, among the three
Pillars, two only existed on a symbolic level and hadn't been revived,
while one couldn't enter the barrier. That's why the Moses Ascetic Order
was fine and lived well all along. When Mr. Fool initially
awakened---the beginning of the return of a Pillar---the Moses Ascetic
Order was completely destroyed...

"This is an inevitability..."

"Defining their high-level titles as 'Pillars' predetermined such a
fate..."

The Chariot Lumian thought even deeper than Madam Magician.

"It was the Brood Hive that brought the Hidden Sage to life and secretly
corrupted Him.

"If I'm not mistaken, the Mother Goddess of Depravity, who split off the
Brood Hive, is one of the true Pillars, right?"

"Ah, yes..." Madam Magician Fors was stunned again. "Fate is truly
wonderful..."

The Chariot Lumian glanced at the head of the bronze long table, then
withdrew his gaze and asked Madam Magician, "Are there only three
Pillars?"

Madam Magician Fors nodded. "From a realistic perspective, there are
countless planets in the universe, each planet equivalent to a world,
and simultaneously, there exist numerous alternate dimensions, too many
to count.

"But in mysticism, there are only three layers of worlds: the physical
world, the spirit world, and the astral world.

"Many schools of mysticism might have different interpretations of this,
but the final division of worlds still comes down to just three layers.

"Returning to conventional concepts, the primordial God Almighty is the
dominator of the astral world, Mr. Fool is the lord of the spirit world,
and the Mother Goddess of Depravity is the sovereign of the physical
world. Well, although She had part of Her sefirot torn away, She still
possesses the symbolism and status of a Pillar.

"You should know that besides the Mother Goddess of Depravity Herself,
the Mother Tree of Desire, and the Son of Chaos being directly born from
the Original Creator, the remaining Great Old Ones were all born from
the union of the Mother Goddess of Depravity and the Original Creator.
They are the first batch of beings She created. She is literally the
mother of the Monarch of Decay, Supernova Dominator, and other Great Old
Ones---the true Mother of All Things.

"Each controls a realm, but not completely. Their authorities overlap
with each other---that's what Pillars are.

"Complete Pillars are at the second level of Above the Sequences, with a
status higher than other Great Old Ones and slightly stronger in power,
but not fundamentally different. A complete Pillar can defeat a Great
Old One but cannot truly kill Them, and at most can simultaneously fight
against two Great Old Ones, probably..."

When saying the last half sentence, Madam Magician was clearly uncertain
and turned her gaze toward the head of the bronze long table.

Mr. Fool, shrouded in grayish-white fog, neither confirmed nor denied
her statement.

Madam Magician withdrew her gaze and said to Lumian, "If a complete
Pillar accommodates one more sefirot, They will lose control over Their
aggregation instinct and will actively consume more sefirot until They
aggregate into the Original Creator, causing His revival.

"Once this process begins, it can only be interrupted by Their complete
fall and division.

"As for the first-level Above the Sequences Great Old Dominators, They
can still accommodate another sefirot that has similar, close, or
adjacent symbolism to Their own. This would make Them equal in power to
the Pillars, though They still wouldn't possess the symbolism of
Pillars.

"In other words, this is the limit of stable existence and suppression
of the aggregation instinct."

"I see..." The Chariot Lumian said what had become the most frequently
spoken phrase at this small gathering.

*It seems the apocalypse is inevitable and unavoidable because the
contradictions cannot be reconciled!*

Madam Magician reminded him, "Don't think that sending away the sefirot
would prevent the apocalypse.

"Let's not even discuss whether the current owners of the sefirot are
willing, but those Outer Deities would need all the Uniquenesses of the
corresponding pathways and one Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristic from
each pathway while accommodating the corresponding sefirot. Should we
have those true gods and Archangels commit suicide or find ways to lower
Their status?"

Sequence 1 was often referred to as Archangels.

Hearing Madam Magician's words, Lumian suddenly had some thoughts.

Madam Magician continued, "Even if we overcome all difficulties and
reach an agreement on similar matters, and this world doesn't destroy
itself through internal strife, the apocalypse would still come.

"You should know that godhood's tone is fundamentally madness, chaos,
filled with desires for destruction and creation. Those Outer Deities
have waited for thousands or tens of thousands of years---They won't
spare our planet.

"Once the barrier is damaged, even if Their attention is focused on the
sefirot, Uniquenesses, and Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristics, it would
still be unbearable for other Beyonders, ordinary people, and our
planet. They are the manifestation of such symbolism.

"For example, the Monarch of Decay would naturally cause the entire
planet and all living beings to start decaying, eventually either
rotting to death or becoming disgusting creatures loyal to Him, and
without necessary resistance, the mere approach of the Supernova
Dominator would tear the planet apart.

"At that time, those above Sequence 2 will be watched, and below
Sequence 2, not many Beyonders have the ability to survive in space.
Sequence 2 is probably the Sequence most likely to survive the
apocalypse, but for most Sequence 2 Angels, it would be extremely
difficult to cross space, resist various dangers, and find a suitable
planet for subsequent survival."

Madam Magician was telling Lumian that once a house collapsed, most
people inside will die---escape couldn't solve the problem.

The Chariot Lumian thoughtfully said, "Is it possible to find common
desires among multiple Outer Deities, throw out the sefirah that would
satisfy the most Outer Deities' needs outside the barrier, incite
internal strife among that portion of Outer Deities, let Them severely
wound each other first, make the wounded ones retreat to deep space, and
thus reduce the number of invading Outer Deities when the apocalypse
comes?"

As he spoke, Lumian furrowed his brow.

"But the victorious Outer Deity would become more powerful---it's
impossible to assess whether this would be equivalent to the Outer
Deities who were driven away..."

As he was muttering to himself, Mr. Fool, who had been silent for a long
time, suddenly spoke, "Actually, there is a hidden fourth Pillar."
