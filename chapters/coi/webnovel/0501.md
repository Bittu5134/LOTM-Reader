## Chapter 501: Honorific Name

*City of Exiles, Morora, doesn't exist?* When Lumian perused the
information Ludwig had "stolen," he couldn't shake the sensation that
Morora was vivid and right before him. This stemmed from the fact that
the scribe had meticulously chronicled every folklore and characteristic
of the city. Even those who hadn't set foot there could conjure a mental
image.

Yet, Madam Magician had just dropped the bombshell---the City of Exiles,
Morora, didn't exist in Lenburg!

*I read it so intently, feeling so nervous and afraid. Finally, you tell
me, 'I'm sorry, I made all this up?'* As Lumian grappled with
the absurdity, his gaze reverted to the letter, eager to uncover Madam
Magician's speculations.

The Major Arcana card holder teased, "Perhaps the individual who penned
this Sealed Artifact information had already lost their sanity,
conjuring the City of Exiles, Morora.

"Maybe it's a colossal prison nestled in the mountains, patrolled by
guards. They provide supplies unattainable independently and remain cut
off from the outside world.

"Perhaps Morora is genuinely an imagined City of Exiles, yet, in a
peculiar way, it already exists...

"Don't dismiss the first and third conjectures as absurd or hyperbolic,
making them implausible. Let me enlighten you; when dealing with Grade 0
Sealed Artifacts, numerous things defy common sense and intuition.
Especially when we're talking about 0-01.

"Personally, I fancy the first conjecture. It emanates a fantastical
beauty. A deranged Keeper jotting down information about a Sealed
Artifact, filled with ramblings and delusions, and treating it as
reality. But what about the truth? Where did it vanish to? Is it no
longer in place?"

At the sight of this, Lumian felt an inexplicable chill, and his hair
stood on end.

Madam Magician had expounded terrifying possibilities. Moreover, she had
employed seemingly casual strokes, brisk descriptions, and a barrage of
questions to cultivate an atmosphere of composure and distortion,
pushing one's nerves to the brink. Prolonged contemplation of it could
drive one to the brink of insanity.

*Isn't this superior to the narrative prowess of most current
bestselling authors in crafting horror tales?* Lumian critiqued
his Major Arcana card holder.

Shaking his head, he relegated 0-01 and the City of Exiles to the
recesses of his mind.

He feared that dwelling on it might tip him into madness.

It wasn't out of the realm of possibility. Lumian hadn't slept since
perusing the information. While he leveraged the 6 a.m. reset of his
body every morning to alleviate fatigue, he occasionally heard
indescribable and spine-chilling voices resembling calls from the depths
of the mountains.

*Phew...* Lumian exhaled and resumed reading the letter.

"Alright, I won't terrify you any longer. In essence, until you truly
confront 0-01, don't summarily dismiss any conjecture or potentiality.

"I've verified the auditory hallucinations you mentioned. It's a mild
corruption induced by delving into 0-01's information. Some entities can
induce corruption merely by knowing their names instead of their code
names. Fortunately, your destiny is entwined with that long-named
fellow. To some extent, it's akin to having the status of an Angel.
Furthermore, you bear Mr. Fool's seal, the Blood Emperor's aura, and
other high-level paraphernalia. That's why you only experienced a faint
auditory hallucination and sensed the beckoning. You didn't suddenly
descend into paranoia and extremism, harboring a desire to seek treasure
in the mountains before vanishing one night."

*Madam Magician revels in spinning horror stories. She insists on
expanding concise explanations into potential scenarios for
me...* Lumian had been in correspondence with his Major Arcana
card holder for quite some time, becoming well-acquainted with her
choice of words and writing style.

"Let me remind you that you're akin to an Angel to some extent, yet you
won't succumb to the corruption associated with higher Sequences. That's
what sets you apart. It's why you can venture into many peculiar places.
Hence, some entities seek to exploit this. Exercise caution and
vigilance, continually scrutinizing yourself.

"By the way, Miss Justice and Judgment extend their gratitude. The
revelation of 0-01 and Vermonda Sauron's whereabouts allowed them to
fulfill a mission entrusted by Mr. Fool before his slumber. Hence, the
rewards are particularly generous this time...

"Your concerns are valid. If you miss the initial trail, whether it's
Bard, Mad Lady, or the traces left by other key members of April Fool's,
it's more likely a trap than a clue. Of course, traps can yield certain
information. As long as you can withstand the associated peril, you
might uncover the architect of the trap.

"If, and I say if, you chance upon a High-Sequence Beyonder of the Seer,
Apprentice, and Marauder pathways while delving into the whereabouts of
the key members of April Fool's, you can invoke my name and seek my
assistance.

"Remember, this is my name. It carries the power to conceal secrets from
others.

"Cosmic Traveler, beholden to the King of Yellow and Black, and the
Sorcerer chronicling the world."

*The King of Yellow and Black is an alias for Mr. Fool... Cosmic
Traveler and chronicling the world sounds amazing... Could she truly be
the Angel of Stars from the Bible?* As Lumian committed it to
memory, he witnessed the honorific name gradually fading, as if erased
and consumed by the void.

At the conclusion of the letter, Madam Magician added: "The Minor
Arcana, Knight of Swords, subordinate to Ma'am Hermit, journeyed to
Feynapotter a few months ago for a certain matter. When you arrive
there, should you require assistance or information, you can reach out
to him.

"His messenger is:

"A peculiar creature wandering above the world, a half-fairy who fiddles
with melodic strings, a messenger that belongs solely to the Knight of
Swords."

*Half-fairy...* Lumian had skimmed through information about
such spirit world creatures, mainly to select a suitable contract
partner. He hadn't delved into the details, making it challenging to
recall.

Simultaneously, he noted that the Knight of Swords's messenger
incantation deviated from the conventional format. Perhaps there was
concern that foes could decipher the correct three-line description and
summon the messenger to target him.

Regardless, with the limiting phrase "a messenger that belongs solely to
the Knight of Swords," the second sentence didn't necessarily have to
depict a creature friendly to humans. However, since it could serve as
the messenger of the Knight of Swords, it could tacitly be considered as
friendly to humans.

Lumian reread Madam Magician's letter from start to finish, mindful not
to overlook any crucial information embedded in her cryptic statements.

Suddenly, a knock echoed on the bedroom door.

Lumian glanced up, and the door creaked open. Ludwig stuck his chubby
head out and, in a daze, uttered, "I'm hungry. It's time for you to
cook."

"Didn't you just eat plenty of cake and crackers?" Lumian's lips
twitched.

Ludwig replied seriously, "That's dessert, not the main course."

Subtly, he licked his lips.

"Moreover, your culinary skills are quite impressive, and those dishes
are quite unique. With a chef around, I don't want to settle for raw
beef, hard bread, and freshly bought potatoes."

The boy's expression turned pleading.

Lumian scoffed.

"Why don't you do it yourself?"

"I can only cook by myself after I recover a little," Ludwig replied
subconsciously before changing his tone. "I'm still a child. You're
actually asking me to cook in the kitchen? Aren't you afraid that I'll
be injured by a knife or burned?"

*I'm just afraid you'll eat the knife... What does it mean to cook after
recovering a little? Is Chef a higher rank than your current Sequence's
strength? Can't you cook if you're not a chef? *Lumian observed
Ludwig leaning against the door frame, looking at him with expectant
brown eyes, and suddenly found the scene familiar.

In the past, he had begged his sister Aurore in the same way.

Lumian sighed and stood up.

"I'm only responsible for three meals. The rest of the time, rely on
dessert, bread, and cold dishes. Don't bother me."

As he spoke, he left the bedroom and entered the kitchen.

While donning an apron and engrossed in cooking, Ludwig, in a caramel
coat, waited at the kitchen door, occasionally wiping his mouth.

After pan-frying a steak, Lumian picked it up and casually tossed it
out.

Ludwig deftly caught it, tore it in a few bites, and stuffed it down his
abdomen.

Observing this, Lumian chuckled inwardly, feeling that this fellow was
even more absurd than he had been back then.

†

In Underground Trier, within a quarry cave.

Lumian stood before the altar, encircled by the recently dismantled wall
of spirituality.

He had completed the Contractee summoning ritual and gained two new
contracted abilities. Now, he awaited Franca and the others to witness
who could successfully gain a messenger.

One of these abilities was Shadow Transformation. It allowed Lumian to
authentically morph into a shadow, merging with it to conceal himself
and move stealthily---a skill he currently lacked.

While such abilities existed in the mystical knowledge of Contractees,
Lumian opted to acquire them from the spirit world creature information
provided by Madam Magician. This prevented the bestowed of Inevitability
from discerning the negative effects he might endure.

Ultimately, Lumian contracted a spirit world creature known as Long
Shadow. He sacrificed six servings of fresh cow and sheep meat in
exchange for this ability, making him more susceptible to sunlight than
ordinary humans.

This wasn't as severe as the aversion Vampires had to sunlight. Lumian
could endure it with his Ascetic endurance.

Another ability he had acquired was the Bottle of Fiction. He found the
unique and practical ability demonstrated by the padre intriguing. It
could effectively screen an enemy, creating a concealed space where the
other party couldn't escape and could only exit through the bottle's
opening; traps could be added.

Since no spirit world creature could provide this ability, Lumian
summoned the creature called the Fantasy Face and completed the contract
with a bottle of blood with strong spirituality.

The blood needed to come from a Beyonder above Sequence 7 or a
corresponding Beyonder creature. Lumian, naturally, wouldn't use his own
blood, as sacrificing it to the Fantasy Face could gradually transform
him into a monster. Instead, he used the blood Madam Magician extracted
from Gardner Martin's corpse---one of the supplementary ingredients for
a Reaper. It was substantial, and there was plenty.

The corresponding downside was a trace of greed.

Before long, Franca, Jenna, and Anthony arrived at the quarry cave, one
after another.
