## Chapter 167: Convergence

Upon hearing Jenna's account, Lumian instinctively twirled and spun, his
surprise evident as he asked, "How do you know all this?"

It made sense that Jenna would have a basic understanding of the room
layout and the thugs' positions after venturing to the second-floor room
and conferring with "Hammer" Ait. However, how did she know about the
ventilation pipe in the ballroom kitchen leading to the second floor? Or
jumping from the neighboring windowsill to the washroom? And what about
the ledge on the outer wall of that specific room? Were these details
within the grasp of an underground singer, known for her bawdy songs and
exaggerated performances?

She shouldn't possess such knowledge!

Jenna, her face adorned with black eye shadow and a fake mole, sported a
smug expression.

"Don't fret about how I know. I avoid seeing what I shouldn't, hearing
what I shouldn't, and asking questions I shouldn't," she retorted,
cleverly turning Lumian's words back on him.

This brought her considerable satisfaction.

*Only those planning an assassination or devising an escape in dire
circumstances would pay attention to such particulars and observe with a
purpose... Which category does Jenna fall into? Her powers of
observation in this environment are nearly on par with a Hunter's.
Sequences leaning toward assassination required gathering environmental
information. Assassination...* Lumian's mind raced, concocting a
plan to bluff Jenna.

Grinning mischievously, he uttered, "So you're an Assassin."

He stressed the word "Assassin."

Jenna's expression changed, her smile freezing.

"How did you figure it out?" she blurted out, shocked.

"By using my brain," Lumian replied, his smile unwavering.

There were still a few Sequences that excelled at environmental
observation. Lumian had taken a bold guess, considering Jenna as an
Assassin. He recalled Ryan and his companions mentioning that Demoness
was a relatively common pathway in the central and northern regions of
Intis, especially Trier. In any case, he had nothing to lose if he was
wrong.

Meanwhile, Lumian pondered to himself, *Not long after arriving in
Trier, I encountered an Assassin and came to her aid. Can this be seen
as a manifestation of the convergence of Beyonder
characteristics?*

*Jenna can't have reached Sequence 7; she isn't a Witch. Otherwise, even
if weakened by the sedative on the paper, she could have effortlessly
overpowered Hedsey with her mystical abilities. The term Witch clearly
indicates proficiency in spells and curses, as Aurore's notebook had
mentioned.*

*She is unlikely to be a Sequence 8 Instigator. How could an Instigator
be fooled by me repeatedly?*

*But it isn't out of the question. Perhaps Jenna had been more foolish
in the past and relied on the Instigator path to enhance her
intelligence? Furthermore, her willingness to provide information on
"Hammer" Ait could be interpreted as a form of instigation.*

*Heh heh, Jenna is a woman, so there's no need to worry about her gender
changing after consuming the Witch potion.*

*Where had Jenna obtained the potion? Had Franca given it to her? Could
Franca also be a Beyonder following the Demoness pathway?*

*If Franca is only a Sequence 8, that would be fine. But what if she
were a Sequence 7 Witch? Who knows if Franca had been male or female
before? Well, her behavior towards women is certainly peculiar. She is
in a romantic relationship with Jenna. Hmm...*

Jenna quietly contemplated her recent words, but she didn't uncover any
information that might have revealed her own Sequence.

She decided not to dwell on what she couldn't figure out. She kindly
reminded Lumian, "If you plan to confront 'Hammer' Ait in the washroom,
you must think it through. According to what I heard from Franca, Ait is
a Pugilist. He excels in close combat more than any other Sequence.
Relying solely on your Beyonder abilities to target him won't be as
effective due to his physical prowess.

"Although you can fight, I believe there's a high chance you'll be
killed on the spot if you engage him in a place like the washroom, which
isn't spacious enough."

"Madame, are you persuading me or taunting me? It seems you still
possess some potential as an Instigator," Lumian candidly voiced his
thoughts, not holding back his criticisms.

He realized that Franca knew "Hammer" Ait better than Baron Brignais.
She had mentioned a crucial point that the latter had omitted.

Setting aside the possibility that Franca had a personal grudge against
"Hammer" Ait, Franca either had a formidable background or had earned
the trust of the boss of the Savoie Mob, gaining access to more
mysticism knowledge and Sequence information than Baron Brignais.

Jenna was taken aback. "You know about Instigators?"

*Is this still a country bumpkin from the countryside? How does he
possess such extensive knowledge about the Beyonder pathways?*

*Franca had mentioned that he's wanted by the authorities. It seemed he
had been involved in a Beyonder incident?*

"I know more than you think," Lumian replied, smiling.

As he spoke, he suddenly recalled a title that had recently belonged to
him: *"Mysticism Illiterate."*

Lumian swiftly pushed aside his melancholy and earnestly considered
Jenna's warning.

Indeed, while Hunters were also skilled in combat and killing as
Sequences, if traps and abilities like Provocation were excluded, they
still couldn't match the prowess of Pugilists in close combat.
Especially in a confined and cramped environment, they couldn't employ
their combat intelligence effectively. It would be difficult for them to
achieve the feat of the weak defeating the strong.

Taking into account the modifications to his Dancer abilities and the
utilization of various unorthodox tactics, Lumian felt he could just
about hold his ground. He wouldn't fail immediately. If he wanted to
eliminate "Hammer" Ait, he could only rely on Fallen Mercury and escape
after a successful strike.

But what set this apart from killing "Baldy" Harman? There was no need
to factor in the presence of ten thugs and ten revolvers.

Lumian assessed his possessions to see if anything could be useful in
such a battle.

*Over 1,700 verl d'or... Fallen Mercury... Blood from the aquatic
monster... Poisonous scales from the aquatic monster... A vial of the
sedative that rendered Jenna powerless... A bottle of stimulating gas to
counteract the effects of the sedative... A bottle of liquid with
unknown properties... A dagger left behind by that pervert... A ritual
silver dagger... Several white bandages...*

As he contemplated, a plan gradually took shape.

As he swayed to the rhythm, he cast a sidelong glance at Jenna and posed
his question.

"Is that washroom spacious?"

Jenna made confirmation. "No, it's not. Besides the bathtub, toilet, and
sink, it can only accommodate four to five people."

In other words, if Lumian and "Hammer" Ait engaged in close combat,
there wouldn't be room for anyone else.

"Is there a curtain outside the bathtub?" Lumian inquired further.

"Yes," Jenna pondered for a moment. "Do you have a gun with you? I
believe it would be better to use a gun. It's safer and gives you a
higher chance of success."

"I don't," Lumian replied, shaking his head.

Jenna sneered, "You intend to carry out the plan tonight with just
that?"

She paused briefly before continuing, "If you truly wish to kill
'Hammer' Ait tonight, I can lend you my revolver."

"You still have a revolver on you?" Lumian was surprised this time.

He hadn't suspected that Jenna had a concealed revolver.

The Showy Diva wore a short white blouse with a wide collar that allowed
her bra to peek out. Her beige fluffy short skirt and black boots that
didn't reach her knees added to her attire. Moreover, she kept raising
her legs as she danced. It seemed impossible for her to have a gun
holster strapped to her inner thigh.

Lumian speculated that the only possible place for her to hide the
revolver was within her pair of boots.

Jenna assumed Ciel was questioning why she carried a revolver, so she
responded with a disdainful sigh.

"I perform in dance halls in places like the market district. Do you
think all those monsters are upstanding citizens? Do you think they
won't act impulsively and try something on me? Those pieces of filth
have twisted minds all day. When their thoughts are controlled by their
desires, they won't consider that I have a connection with Franca and a
good relationship with her. Damn it, if deterrence always worked, there
wouldn't be so many criminals!"

While speaking, Jenna followed the rhythm of the drums and crouched
down, searching inside her boots.

Swiftly standing up, she pressed herself against Lumian. Twisting her
body, she slipped her hand into his naturally lowered and swaying palm.

Lumian immediately felt the cold metal texture and the solid wood.

Without missing a beat, Lumian withdrew his hand and discreetly tucked
the gun into his pocket.

Afterward, Jenna continued, "I bought it with most of my savings when I
first arrived in the market district, before meeting Franca. That
blasted black-market merchant even tried to bed me, but I kicked his
shin, making him scream in pain."

*Carrying a gun for self-defense at all times... You're quite vigilant.
Otherwise, those mobsters could have controlled you before meeting
Franca. You might have even become a part-time dancer or a street
girl...* Lumian replied with a smile, "Well done!"

As the accompanying music reached its end, Jenna fell silent.

With the drumbeats fading away, Lumian observed Jenna as she walked
toward the stage. He left the dance floor and returned to the outer
circle.

Taking advantage of the opportunity to visit the washroom, he carefully
examined and familiarized himself with the revolver Jenna had given him.

It was a compact revolver with a short barrel, ideal for concealed
carry.

Its color was a dark iron-black, and the grip was crafted from walnut
wood. It held a total of six bullets.

After tinkering with the revolver for a while, Lumian realized a
predicament.

His shooting experience was lacking. Previously, he had primarily relied
on the shotgun's wide spray of pellets.

*Oh well. I don't expect to kill Hammer Ait with a single shot. Injuring
and weakening him will suffice. At such close range, with my grip and
some shooting experience, I can't miss by much...*

*In an environment like the washroom, there's only one opportunity for a
shot. "Hammer" Ait won't provide me with a chance for a second
shot...* Lumian swiftly made up his mind.

Exiting the washroom, he headed toward the kitchen of the Salle de
Gristmill, taking advantage of the absence of people in the vicinity.
