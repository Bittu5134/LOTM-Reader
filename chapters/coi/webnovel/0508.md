## Chapter 508: Patient Zero

Lugano, who had been listening, shot Lumian a puzzled glance. He
couldn't fathom why Lumian would strike up a casual conversation with
Pierre just as they were on the verge of departing.

A few more moments, and the official Beyonders would make their
entrance!

Besides, delving too deep into this matter could invite trouble down the
road. They might end up under scrutiny, or worse, attract the attention
of the Derangement's source, prompting immediate intervention!

Pierre pondered for more than ten seconds before uttering with
uncertainty, "Patient Zero seemed to be a guest renting a room at our
bar..."

"Foreigner?" Lumian inquired with composure.

Having already briefed the official Beyonders about the Derangement
through Franca and resolved to find an opportunity to "teleport" away
later, Lumian was no longer as tense as before. Thus, before leaving, he
aimed to unravel more about Derangement and construct a plausible
explanation for the inconsistencies.

This quest for information, problem analysis, and uncovering of clues
and answers was all part of a Conspirer's acting. With some idle time on
his hands, Lumian seized the chance to digest some of the potion.

Lumian wasn't overly concerned about the potential repercussions of
being privy to this situation.

Could the information on Derangement hold a candle to 0-01's sealed
intel?

Moreover, as long as he didn't go berserk on the spot, he could later
seek assistance from his superior to explore potential solutions!

Pierre contemplated for a few seconds, his expression reflecting
confusion, and then he said, "Probably... I can't recall her name, and I
have no idea where she came from. All I remember is that she suddenly
lost her mind and dashed from the motel upstairs to the bar. She tried
to bite people and barked like a dog."

The infected foreigner spreading Derangement to Dardel? Then why were
the townsfolk displaying no inclination to escape this place? Is this
also a manifestation of Derangement? Lumian asked thoughtfully, "Did she
manage to bite anyone? What happened to her?"

"We took care of her before she could sink her teeth into anyone. We
apprehended her and handed her over to the health department," Pierre
recollected.

*Sent to the health department?* Lumian nodded slowly.

"Did the next person to succumb to madness come from the health
department?"

"Yes, exactly!" Pierre affirmed this time.

Lumian pondered for a moment and inquired, "What did the resident look
like?"

"A young woman. Her face was a bit pale, and her eyes were vacant. I-I
can't recall her appearance..." Pierre couldn't help but raise his palm
and rub his head.

Upon hearing this, Lumian's heart stirred.

If the root of all the abnormalities in Dardel indeed stemmed from a
deranged individual, many contradictions could find an explanation!

Patient Zero was already in a state of madness; instinctively, she would
spread Derangement to those around her in a supernatural sense,
regardless of whether it was an isolated village or a bustling town
serving as a transportation hub.

Simultaneously, she would subconsciously employ her ability to
disseminate the supernatural Derangement, dropping hints to the
townsfolk that leaving wasn't an option. She would control all channels
that might carry the news. However, due to her madness and lack of
thorough consideration, she didn't explicitly order the townsfolk not to
discuss Derangement with the steam locomotive passengers.

Certainly, it wasn't necessarily due to a lack of thorough
consideration. Lumian believed it was more plausible that the lunatic's
instincts desired to involve more people and infect them with
Derangement. Consequently, people who were aware of this weren't
permitted to leave or seek help from the authorities. On the other hand,
the prohibition didn't prevent residents from discussing Derangement
with passersby.

This was a limited and relatively safe method of contagion. Passengers
who knew about Derangement were akin to approaching the source of the
plague. For instance, Lugano's luck had turned, increasing the
probability of contracting the disease. Lumian and he had forgotten the
option of escaping. The more they communicated, the more desperate they
became, ultimately reaching a dead end. They were resolute in entering
Dardel to investigate.

This was a precursor to becoming infected with Derangement. Unbeknownst
to them, they had inadvertently received a mental cue.

With this in mind, Lumian suspected that the young woman might be a
survivor of the village that had previously been eradicated, a potential
carrier who had escaped the authorities' purge.

She had intertwined these memories with Derangement and disseminated
them. That was how the residents of Dardel learned about a similar
plague in a village wiped out by the authorities.

Typically, they lacked the qualifications or means to know such things!

Having formulated this preliminary hypothesis, Lumian smiled and turned
to Pierre and the bar waiter, asking, "Where is the village you
mentioned that was destroyed by the authorities because of Derangement?"

"I-I think it's somewhere in the Haut-Hornacis Province..." Pierre
recalled the rumors he had heard.

*Haut-Hornacis Province... That's quite a distance from Upper Coastal
Province. Moreover, there's no direct steam locomotive; it requires a
transfer through a few provinces in the West Midseashire Coast or Trier.
How could you folks, who rarely leave Dardel, have heard such a rumor?
Did a bard or passenger from Haut-Hornacis Province pass by this
transportation hub? *The more Lumian pondered, the more he
leaned toward his hypothesis.

He refrained from pressing further and probed Pierre, "This Derangement
holds significant research value. We'll venture into Dardel to
investigate its source and try to find a cure.

"However, preparations will take some time. Moreover, it's nighttime.

"At dawn, we will step into Dardel. We won't depart until we resolve the
problem."

Lumian stressed the phrases "will enter Dardel" and "will not leave for
the time being" to gauge Pierre and the bar waiter's reactions.

Their expressions underwent several changes, and they were no longer as
hysterical as before.

After a few moments, Pierre implored, "You must come to town tomorrow!"

"No problem," Lumian replied with a reassuring smile.

He was now even more convinced that this was an instinctive infection
and influence. There was no structured approach to handling the
alterations. As long as he avoided triggering a crucial matter or even
took the initiative to broach the topic of cooperation, he could
effectively deceive the source of Derangement.

Observing Pierre and the bar waiter about to move toward the other
windows of the steam locomotive, Lumian called out to them, "Wait a
moment."

After the two of them turned in surprise, Lumian gestured towards the
table between the two sofas.

"You can take the cutlery away now."

Pierre and the bar waiter glanced at the dining table in confusion,
realizing that only remnants were left on the empty plates.

*Had they finished eating already? The delivery men hadn't even departed
yet!*

Pierre and the bar waiter were aware that they had spent a considerable
amount of time discussing the Derangement issue, but it still felt
surreal.

*Won't they eating too quickly?*

*Was he feeding three lions?*

*Burp...* Ludwig wiped his mouth with a tablecloth, a content
expression on his face.

After the two townsfolk cleared away the cutlery, gathered their food
boxes, and departed from the platform, Lumian smiled at Lugano and
remarked, "Continue watching. Chill."

*I can't chill. How are we to escape when the official Beyonders
arrive?* Lugano's heart felt like it was being grilled.

Observing his reaction, Lumian muttered silently, *He's indeed acting
like a wild Beyonder with a low Sequence and little knowledge... He
doesn't show anything special like Ludwig... Is he really an ordinary
wild Beyonder who only accepted a mission to follow me?*

Simultaneously, Lumian focused his attention and checked Lugano's luck.
He realized that the ghastly green traces had vanished, and there was no
grisly calamity in store.

This meant that the Doctor no longer had the potential to contract
Derangement, and he likely wouldn't be embroiled in the officials'
operations to deal with Dardel's abnormality later.

After a while, Lumian heard a loud noise and saw the night suddenly
brighten outside.

Light streamed down from midair.

Lumian looked up and noticed two colossal objects floating in the night.

They were two airships clad in dark gray paint, frantically spinning
their paddles.

They were much smaller than the one Lumian had seen in Trier. The
condensed light shone from their front and lower positions, converging
on the edge of Dardel.

Simultaneously, the town erupted in a cacophony of barking once more, as
if movement was taking place everywhere.

*The officials from the Faust region are here?* Lumian averted
his gaze, awaiting the outcome.

Shouts, cries, gunshots, and various beams of sunlight continued for
nearly an hour before completely subsiding.

Before long, a team of police officers entered the private room,
questioning the now disguised, fake identification-wielding Lumian and
company's interactions with Dardel's residents.

Other than anything related to Derangement, Lumian told them everything
honestly.

He was ready to "teleport" away with Ludwig and Lugano at any moment.

After recording and comparing tickets and identification, the police
officers left the carriage.

Lumian patiently waited until dawn. The police officers returned,
presenting three contracts and requesting their signatures.

The contract explained that the disturbance from the previous night had
resulted from a special military operation, and everyone was obligated
to keep it confidential.

*Does what I revealed before my signature count?* Lumian
chuckled inwardly and calmly signed with an alias.

His fake identity had just been activated, and it had minimal mystic
connections.

After the police departed, Lumian, having intentionally gone through the
official process firsthand, intended to grasp Lugano and Ludwig's
shoulders and "teleport" away.

Uncertain if the contract signed with an alias would be discovered, he
aimed to avoid potential risks.

At that moment, Lumian noticed a towering figure behind Lugano.

It was his messenger, Penitent Baynfel, draped in a dark clergyman's
robe and surrounded by charred flames.

Baynfel sent a folded letter drifting towards Lumian.

Lugano was taken aback to see a piece of paper materialize. He
instinctively glanced behind him, but Lumian opened the letter and
perused its contents.

"Based on the feedback I received, this should be the escape of a Sealed
Artifact.

"That Sealed Artifact resembles a young woman. It first surfaced during
a catastrophe in Haut-Hornacis Province. Most of the time, she remains
in her normal state, appearing lifeless, pale, and muddle-headed.
However, once she enters a state of madness, she gradually infects the
surrounding people with the same Derangement as her. There's no definite
transmission pattern.

"She might not be in the same state every time she goes mad. The same
goes for her Derangement symptoms.

"In her normal state, although she's like an unintelligent ghost and
acts on instinct, she possesses a power akin to the power of speech,
where whatever she says comes true, and if she declares someone dead,
they will die..."
