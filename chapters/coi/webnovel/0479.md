## Chapter 479: Matching Items

*Bang!*

The jet-black bullet, ablaze with fiery fury, slammed into Gardner
Martin, who was gripped by desire, dead center in his gleaming silver
armor once again.

It hit him like a battering ram, sending shockwaves through his frame.

A web of fractures sprawled out from the impact zone, causing Gardner
Martin's advance to stagger, forcing him to lean backward.

This abrupt jolt snapped him out of his reverie. He witnessed General
Philip, wreathed in black flames and encased in frost, while Lumian
materialized behind the Deceased. Lumian's right hand acted as a
revolver, launching a crimson fireball straight at the back of Philip's
head.

Behind Gardner Martin's mask, his pupils dilated, and a shiver raced
down his spine, as if an icy cascade had been dumped over him.

This abrupt awakening effectively quelled his desires. Without
hesitation, he dropped to one knee and drove the hefty broadsword into
the wilderness.

The broadsword shattered, breaking into myriad fragments of light that
swept toward Franca, Lumian, and the others, including the lifeless form
of General Philip.

Amidst a resounding crack, Franca, constantly shifting positions,
remained enveloped by the Hurricane of Light, her body fracturing like a
shattered mirror.

Lumian and Jenna met the same fate. Only Anthony Reid, lacking Mirror
Substitution, instinctively lunged to the ground, curling up to shield
his vital parts.

The luminous tempest rapidly dissipated before Lumian and his companions
outlined themselves on the outskirts of the wilderness, facing the
pale-black stone bricks.

They witnessed a brilliant white flaming spear hurtling towards the
distant majestic city, covering more than a hundred meters in the blink
of an eye.

As soon as the fiery-spear materialized upon impact with the ground,
Gardner Martin, draped in silver armor, rose again, directing his focus
towards the city veiled in a thin fog.

After several consecutive attempts, Gardner Martin distanced himself
from Franca and the others, sprinting towards the dilapidated structures
at the city's periphery.

Lumian chose not to pursue him. Instead, he sprinted to the edge of the
Sunrise Gleam to check on Anthony Reid.

The Psychiatrist's body bore a multitude of bloody wounds, with the most
severe on the left side of his back, revealing a glimpse of his beating
heart.

Lying on his side, curled up and bloodied, Anthony Reid forced a smile
upon seeing Lumian.

There was no fear of death in that smile---only relief, relaxation, and
satisfaction.

The taste of revenge was indeed sweet.

Observing Anthony Reid's lips moving as if he intended to entrust
something, Lumian scoffed and remarked, "Do you wish to utter your final
words? Do you want us to dispatch your belongings to your home on the
West Midseashire Coast?"

As he spoke, Lumian retrieved a silver earring, securing it to his left
earlobe.

Squatting down, he pressed his left hand against the gaping wound on
Anthony's back.

Abruptly, his palm slid upward, and the gruesome wound shifted to
Anthony's shoulder.

In the blink of an eye, the most critical injury on Anthony's body
vanished, leaving him as good as new. However, the initially minor
wounds on his shoulder deepened, revealing white bones and causing blood
to seep out.

This was Lie's Damage Transfer, capable of addressing one wound at a
time.

Anthony was taken aback, feeling as if life had been restored to him.

Though the pain persisted, and his body weakened, at least the specter
of imminent death had dissipated.

Then, Jenna approached, placing him in a supine position.

With a swift pfft, Jenna thrust an obsidian arrow into Anthony's chest.

The Arrow of the Bloodthirsty promptly absorbed the blood, turning
Anthony's pupils red. The invisible flames in the sky seemed a bit
blinding, and the scent of blood in the air proved enticing.

Simultaneously, the smaller wounds on his body swiftly healed, and the
more severe ones showed significant improvement. In a matter of minutes,
they should close up on their own, ceasing to impede his movements.

Anthony Reid, teetering on the edge of death, stood up, bewildered,
examining his body with disbelief.

*I've nearly recovered? I'm alright just like that? *As a
Spectator, his emotions visibly fluctuated.

"Not a bad combination," Franca praised. "As long as you don't perish on
the spot and refrain from losing control and transforming into a
monster, there's still a chance to save you. At most, you'll become
weakened."

Lie's Damage Transfer, coupled with the formidable self-healing
abilities bestowed by the Arrow of the Bloodthirsty, produced such a
remarkable effect.

Franca turned her gaze to Lumian, questioning, "I thought you'd
intercept Gardner Martin."

In that critical moment, the others couldn't match Gardner Martin's
speed as he fled. Only Lumian, capable of Spirit World Traversal, had
the potential to catch up and effectively hinder him.

"Do you think I didn't want to?" Lumian retorted, a note of mockery in
his tone.

However, he lacked the ability!

Had he not been affected by Voisin Sanson's Circle Inhabitant during his
first "teleportation" today, returning him to his original spot without
expending his spirituality, Lumian wouldn't have maintained a stable
state. He wouldn't even have been able to use Lie for Damage Transfer.
He would have had to rely on Franca or Jenna. How could he possibly have
caught up to Gardner Martin?

Franca instantly grasped Lumian's meaning---he had engaged in battles
before and after entering this place, and his spirituality was on the
verge of depletion.

"Alright." Franca shifted her attention to the two Primordial Demoness
figurines, one black and one white, lying undisturbed on the ground,
untouched by the Hurricane of Light. Frowning, she inquired, "Where
should I toss these two?"

Them constantly causing abnormalities seemed like a scam!

"Take them with you." Lumian considered for a moment before smiling. "If
it weren't for them, how could we have dispatched General Philip so
effortlessly? We might need them to escape in the future. Yes, we can't
entrust both to one person. You take one, and Jenna will take the
other."

After a brief pause, Franca responded, "I'll still take the white one."

As a member of the Demoness Sect, holding the orthodox Primordial
Demoness figurine was only natural.

Observing Jenna pick up the pitch-black Primordial Demoness figurine,
Franca muttered in confusion, "Why is there such a figurine? According
to the Purifiers' dossier and information from other secret
organizations, members of the Demoness Sect only carry bone figurines.
There's nothing that's so black."

While Franca spoke, she scrutinized the charred Primordial Demoness bone
figurine, comparing it with her own.

Soon, she discerned differences in the details.

Aside from the stark white and pitch-black hues, the eyes at the tips of
the Primordial Demoness's snake-like hair faced different directions. If
one looked left, the other would undoubtedly look right.

"Like a mirror image, mirror... Is this the Primordial Demoness in the
mirror?" Franca ventured a guess, amalgamating the abilities and traits
of the Demoness pathway with her experience in the peculiar mirror
world. "This shouldn't be possible under normal circumstances. It
wouldn't be easy for the Iron and Blood Cross Order to find such a
figurine..."

She now comprehended the reason behind their encounters with Gardner
Martin and General Philip.

This was a manifestation of the Law of Beyonder Characteristics
Convergence. Except for Anthony, an unwitting Psychiatrist brought in by
his companion, everyone present was either a Hunter or a Demoness.

Furthermore, Franca and Anthony had entered through the same method as
General Philip. They would inevitably emerge at the edge of this
wilderness, teeming with mirror fragments.

*Primordial Demoness in the mirror...* Lumian found the
description ominous.

Without delay, he addressed Franca and the others, "Search General
Philip's corpse and help me guard the surroundings. I'll set up a ritual
to restore my spirituality."

Jenna expressed surprise. "There's a ritual that can restore
spirituality?"

Her gaze naturally swept over General Philip's corpse, realizing it had
been split into five or six pieces, each a gruesome mess.

The Beyonder characteristics had yet to emerge at that moment. The boon
from the evil god couldn't return to its source, slowly sinking back
into the lifeless form.

Lumian entered a dimly lit area with grayish-white stone pillars, found
cover, and swiftly set up the altar. Franca could surmise who he was
praying to, so she joined him to guard against any unforeseen incidents.

Jenna contemplated for a few seconds before approaching the altar.
Retrieving the lucky gold coin, she said to Lumian, "This is the lucky
gold coin that the boy gave me. I don't know if it's useful when given
to others, but there's no harm in trying."

She delegated the task of searching the corpse to Anthony Reid, who was
rapidly recovering.

Franca observed in silence for a moment before affirming, "True."

Lumian didn't hesitate. After all, Will had a close connection to the
Tarot Club. Even if the lucky gold coin couldn't be lent to others, it
wouldn't bring about any negative effects.

Placing the Loen gold pound on the altar, Lumian conjured a wall of
spirituality, ignited all the candles, and took two steps back.

Rather than proceeding with the boon-seeking ritual, he attempted to
recite Mr. Fool's honorific name.

"The Fool that doesn't belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above
the gray fog; the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck..."

As Hermes reverberated, the lucky gold coin on the altar illuminated. A
thin gray fog emanated from the wall of spirituality, enveloping the
wilderness's periphery.

The fog in the distant majestic city appeared to thicken.

Before long, just as Lumian began praying for a boon, a frenzied and
terrifying roar echoed from the area where the weather was chaotic and
faint giant figures lingered.

Despite the thin gray fog, the four of them felt dizzy. The blood in
their bodies raced, and their hearts pounded.

"It's truly useful. It's genuinely lucky..." Lumian gazed at the
dazzling golden coin on the altar, sighing sincerely.

Had it not been for the ritual and Mr. Fool's gray fog's protection, the
roar could have inflicted severe damage, especially considering Lumian's
nearly depleted spirituality. He might have lost control, putting
Anthony Reid, still recovering from severe injuries, in jeopardy.

*Phew...* Lumian exhaled and continued to recite in a deep voice
under the watchful eyes of Franca and Jenna, "Power of Inevitability!

"You are the past, the present, and the future;

"You are the cause, the effect, and the process..."
