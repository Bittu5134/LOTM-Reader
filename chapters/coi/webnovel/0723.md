## Chapter 723: Secret of Immortality

After some time had passed, Anthony Reid guided the shriveled
brownish-yellow dog back to the quarry cave that housed a fixed entrance
to the mirror world.

Turning to Lumian, he said, "You can dispel the Animal Creation Spell
now."

Lumian glanced at the enormous dog, which had lost its ferocious and
ruthless demeanor. With a smile, he recited the dispelling incantation
in Hermes: "Monk!"

Lumian had personally crafted the ritualistic dog skin. While he had
used Padre Guillaume Bénet's activation incantation, he had modified the
dispelling incantation.

Initially, Lumian wanted to use the name of Gehrman Sparrow, one of his
two idols, as the dispelling incantation. However, since Gehrman was Mr.
Fool's Angel of Redemption, uttering his name in Hermes might have
unusual consequences and seem blasphemous. Consequently, Lumian
discarded that idea.

Since the first ritualistic hide he made was dog skin, Lumian drew
inspiration from the phrase "Monks Chasing Dogs" and chose the word
"Monk" for the dispelling incantation.

As a dark light flared, it revealed a pitiful-looking Moran Avigny.

Instinctively, Moran reached for a handkerchief in his chest pocket and
wiped away the dried blood, tears, saliva, and mucus from his face.

Rather than getting directly to the point, Lumian decided to begin with
trivial questions to bolster his credibility and optimize the hypnotic
effect.

With a blend of derision and a sigh, he said, "I can't grasp why you
Mirror People loathe your real world equivalents."

Moran Avigny sneered in response. "If you were perpetually confined to
the cold, gloomy, sealed mirror, you'd also despise your counterpart who
basks in the sun, savors fine food and drink, and revels in leisure and
pleasure."

"But your existence wasn't a natural occurrence. It was an accident,"
Jenna pointed out, narrowly avoiding mentioning that they were
monstrosities inhabiting a unique mirror world.

Chuckling, Moran Avigny retorted, "What bearing does that have on our
envy and hatred?

"We didn't trigger the accident. As we were born and have been
perpetuating our kind, we possess the right to seek a superior life."

Momentarily at a loss for words, Franca and Jenna fell silent.

Speaking in a friendly tone, Lumian said, "You indeed have that right.
However, it cannot involve murder or injuring the original body. Why not
collaborate with official organizations, such as the Church of The Fool?
After fleeing Fourth Epoch Trier, you could depart this city and
commence a new life elsewhere."

Moran Avigny scoffed. "You believe we can trust and cooperate with these
sun-dwelling organizations?"

"Are you not already collaborating with the School of Truth?" Lumian
exposed Moran Avigny's deception.

After a brief pause, Moran Avigny stated, "We have a mission. We desire
the authentic restoration of this world."

"Authentic?" Lumian intentionally provoked. "How can authenticity exist
in a mirror? You Mirror People merely resemble the genuine ones. Upon
death, you will revert to mirror shards."

Following the provocation, Lumian's eyes turned silver-black as he
examined Moran Avigny's fate tributary, aiming to deter him from
providing a response that could endanger his life.

After a quick observation confirming that his question wouldn't pose a
significant risk, Lumian deactivated the Eye of Calamity to preserve his
spirituality.

With a meaningful smile, Moran Avigny said, "No, in a certain sense,
what resides in the mirror is real.

"Upon completing our mission, we will fully return to reality!"

Intrigued by Moran Avigny's confidence, Franca asked, "Why do you say
that?"

Moran Avigny's gaze swept over the two Demonesses. Now in his refractory
period, he chuckled and said, "Even I cannot comprehend the most basic
reason. All I can disclose is that it relates to the Chaos Demoness we
revere deep within the mirror world. She is the true Primordial
Demoness!

"Moreover, I can offer an example: After transforming into a Witch and
interacting with mirror magic, every Demoness's true self dwells within
the mirror."

Observing Franca and Jenna's skepticism, Moran Avigny, eager to express
his thoughts, inquired with a smile,

"Are you aware of the Demoness pathway's Sequence 3 name?"

In unison, Franca and Jenna shook their heads. "No."

With a slight nod, Moran Avigny explained, "It's known as the Demoness
of Unaging. Eternal youth, skilled in resurrection and rebirth.

"Why are they so challenging to kill, capable of resurrection and
rebirth? It's because what they destroy is merely their external form.
Their authentic selves have always been imprisoned and sealed within the
mirror!

"If the false ones perish, they can swiftly be resurrected through the
projection of their true selves in the mirror!

"Consider this: how can one's true self, imprisoned, sealed, and
utilized as a source of resurrection, not despise the false one in
reality? Why wouldn't they yearn to escape the mirror and reclaim what
is rightfully theirs?"

Franca abruptly recalled the moment she first entered the unique mirror
world.

At that time, she had encountered her body's original self, the one with
thick brown eyebrows and short flaxen-colored hair before ingesting the
Witch potion. His face was drenched in blood, and his eyes brimmed with
malice and hatred.

*Could it be that after drinking the Witch potion and transforming into
a woman, her male self didn't disappear but was exiled to the mirror,
unable to escape?* Franca was both alarmed and suspicious.

Jenna also remembered something from her past.

During the process of becoming a Witch, she saw her other self in an
illusion---her malevolent, mirror-like self. Both of them plummeted into
the black flames, and she struggled to crawl out, returning to the ice
above the black flames to complete her advancement. The malevolent self
was dragged into the bottomless Abyss by the python-like black shadow.

*Could it symbolize self-division?*

*Is a part of me truly suffering in the mirror?*

Noticing his two Demoness companions' perplexed state, Lumian smiled at
Moran Avigny and said, "It doesn't necessarily involve
self-imprisonment. It's conceivable that during the Witch transformation
process, they formed a profound connection with their mirror selves,
enabling them to master mirror magic. To a degree, this also allows for
their resurrection."

"The mirror self is tainted with blood, malice, hatred, and malevolence
because they are perpetually in this state. They constantly envy their
real selves, just like you Mirror People from a unique world."

Unable to uncover the truth at the moment, Lumian preferred not to
linger on the subject and attempted to shift the blame to others.

Furthermore, as a Mirror Person, Moran Avigny had an innate inclination
to take sides. His words needed to be cautiously accepted and analyzed
from a different perspective.

Upon hearing Lumian's explanation, Franca and Jenna's expressions
softened. Moran Avigny mocked, "Self-deception cannot conceal the
truth."

Recognizing that the initial preparations were nearly complete, Lumian
decided to redirect the conversation back to the main topic.

Originally, their objective was related to Mirror People, but now Lumian
sensed that the matter involving the School of Truth was more relevant
and pressing. He needed to inquire about it first.

His eyes turned silver-black once more as he gazed at Moran Avigny and
asked, "Did you enter into a contract with the School of Truth's
Overseer?"

"Of course we did. How else could we collaborate? We all value
contracts," Moran Avigny replied with pride.

Lumian chuckled.

"He didn't surreptitiously modify the terms the instant you signed the
contract, did he?"

"No, I am highly attentive to such matters. As you know, I am a Judge in
the mystical sense," Moran Avigny responded confidently.

Lumian probed further, "Have you met the Overseer?"

Moran Avigny shook his head.

"He signed the contract first and then dispatched his subordinate to
deliver it. We never actually met."

"What has the Overseer been up to lately?" Lumian inquired cautiously.

Moran Avigny chuckled.

"I am merely a cog of his immense Under the Table black net. I assist in
completing specific matters through transactions. I am unaware of what
those matters allude to or the motivations behind them.

"Yes, he once mentioned that he intended to use individuals like me to
weave an invisible and massive vortex. He could infuse his strongest
desires into it and achieve results.

"A few days ago, he casually remarked that the vortex is on the verge of
taking shape."

*The vortex is about to take shape...* Lumian continued to
monitor the changes in Moran Avigny's fate tributary and, after some
contemplation, asked, "How do you and the Overseer typically
communicate? Is there a special contingency plan in case of an
emergency?"

This was something he needed to ascertain as quickly as possible. The
abrupt attack on Intis's Minister of Industry, Moran Avigny, and his
enigmatic disappearance was breaking news. It wouldn't take long for the
news to spread. When that happened, the Overseer would undoubtedly learn
about it and promptly sever his original communication channel.

†

In Moran Avigny's villa.

Angoulême de François, the captain of the Purifier mobile team directly
under Trier's diocese, had been prepared and swiftly arrived at the
scene.

After listening to the on-scene Purifiers' report and assessing the
scene, Angoulême frowned.

"A member of the Aurora Order?"

*Not Hidden Blade and the others?*

*What are they up to!*

Following a moment of reflection, Angoulême issued an order,

"Let's first suppress the news of Moran Avigny's incident to avoid
alerting the individuals and factions behind this abnormality. We may
still have an opportunity to uncover clues and proceed with our
investigation."

This was his experience and a process the Purifiers were already
familiar with.
