## Chapter 918: Tacit Cooperation

Just as the reanimated female corpse's frost-covered ice crystal spear
was about to pierce the surveillance screen, a gunshot rang out. A
bright yellow bullet arrived first, striking the middle of the ice
crystal spear and causing it to suddenly shatter and break apart piece
by piece.

After transferring to another mirrored decorative item, Franca
immediately understood the opponent's intentions upon seeing the
reanimated female corpse's actions. She quickly took out the Inevitable
Gun, extended it through the mirror surface, and pulled the trigger.

Having successfully prevented the ice crystal spear's strike, she
immediately moved to withdraw her hands, pretending to traverse to other
mirrors with Jenna, Anthony, and Ludwig in order to lure the reanimated
female corpse in to surround this enemy.

However, the reanimated female corpse didn't even glance in her
direction. Sharp frost spears suddenly condensed in front of her body,
all thrusting towards the large screen simultaneously.

It was like a huge ice flower carved out of ice was blooming.

Franca's pupils dilated instantly. Taking advantage of her hands not yet
having returned to the area behind the mirror, she pulled the Inevitable
Gun's trigger once again.

*Bang!*

That classically styled brass-colored revolver fired an iron-black
bullet, which created a small explosion upon striking one of the frost
spears.

The explosion covered all the frost spears, tearing them apart and
scattering them in all directions.

Heavy Strike!

*Splat splat splat*, some ice crystal fragments inevitably hit
the surveillance screen, creating multiple dead pixels and areas where
colors bled together on the large screen.

Franca was nearly scared to death---the large screen had almost been
completely damaged!

She immediately left the mirrored decorative item and returned to the
surveillance room, launching an all-out attack against the reanimated
female corpse.

In this situation, the best strategy was to use offense to suppress the
opponent and prevent her from destroying the surveillance screen. Pure
defense wouldn't last long, as the item that needed protection was a
relatively fragile technological product.

*One can be a thief for a thousand days, but how can you guard against a
thief for a thousand days? There will always be gaps in
defenses!*

*Bang! Bang! Bang!* Franca continuously pulled the trigger,
firing bullets to force the reanimated female corpse away from the area
closer to the large screen.

Jenna also left the area behind the mirror, directly guarding in front
of the surveillance console to prevent stray bullets from damaging the
screen.

Almost simultaneously, Jenna felt herself collide with an invisible
spider web, with transparent thin threads constricting her body.

Some of these threads bound her limbs, while others stirred up her
condition, striving to restrict her movements and interfere with her
casting of black magic.

Fortunately, Jenna now had relatively rich combat experience. As soon as
she left the mirrored decorative item, she condensed several bizarre
Demoness black flames around herself. Now she immediately let them fall,
burning the spirituality of the transparent spider silk and spreading
out.

The intense feeling of constriction instantly lessened somewhat. Jenna
quickly sidestepped, shielding the large screen.

*Crack!*

She used a Mirror Substitution to block both the reanimated female
corpse's opportunistic attack on the surveillance screen and the stray
bullets created by Franca's continuous shooting.

During this process, Franca emptied six ordinary bullets, hitting the
reanimated female corpse once and consuming one of her Mirror
Substitutions.

She then retreated to the front of the large screen, using a special
loader to reload bullets, while Jenna instinctively lunged forward,
replacing Franca, using her own gun, frost, and black magic to attack
furiously, suppressing the enemy.

With everyone currently at the Sequence 7 level, a short-term reckless
outburst was still very effective!

In this way, Franca and Jenna continuously rotated, one defending, one
attacking, one reloading bullets, the other firing rapidly as if
unconcerned about running out of ammunition. They temporarily restricted
the reanimated female corpse to the area near the door. However, because
the opponent had Mirror Substitutions and strong spiritual intuition,
Franca had not yet used bullets like Impregnating Bullet or triggered
effects like Sure Hit or Certain Death.

She was waiting for an opportunity, because a Sequence 7 Demoness
shouldn't be able to use many Mirror Substitutions!

Even if the reanimated female corpse had once reached the demigod level
and gained the characteristic of reduced Mirror Substitution
consumption, allowing her to use a few more Mirror Substitutions than
Franca and the others who were currently at the same Sequence 7 level,
it certainly wouldn't be many more.

After fighting intensely for dozens of seconds, both Franca and Jenna
felt weakened, their lungs like hot bellows continuously exhaling fiery
breaths.

At the same time, they felt varying degrees of pain throughout their
bodies.

They were well aware that this was caused by the diseases and decay
spread by the two plague bombs earlier. Due to the viscous flesh and
yellow-green pus covering every part of the surveillance room, the
mystical pathogens and decay forces were continuously strengthening. The
infection had finally occurred in the two Demonesses of Affliction who
had disease resistance, and it was gradually worsening.

Neither Franca nor Jenna were willing to immediately use a Mirror
Substitution to resolve the disease and decay. Their Mirror
Substitutions were now very limited in number, and they wanted to
conserve them to protect the large screen.

What puzzled Franca was that although her Inevitable Gun was also
continuously spreading disease and decay, the reanimated female corpse
didn't seem to be significantly affected, only slightly weaker than
before.

*Could she really be a zombie or a marionette, immune to most mystical
pathogens and with strong resistance to decay forces? She only initially
affected Jenna with the spider web, then abandoned this strategy. Was it
because the spider web was a flammable object with spirituality, which
would cause the Demoness black flames---which could only be produced one
by one or in small clusters---to spread, burning the mystical pathogens
and decay forces in the air, slowing down the speed of our onset of
illness and the progress of symptom severity?* As this thought
flashed through Franca's mind, she actively began to create a spider
web.

The invisible spider silk entangled both the reanimated female corpse
and Jenna, forcing the former to use her own Demoness black flames to
evade, and reminding Jenna that she could produce and consume her own,
letting this area fall completely into the burning of Demoness black
flames, thereby clearing out the mystical pathogens and reducing the
intensity of the decay forces!

Inside Moon Plaza in the surveillance footage.

Lumian was suppressing the reanimated female corpse in all aspects, but
due to her Mirror Substitutions, strong spiritual intuition, and rich
combat experience, he couldn't achieve a quick victory.

By now, the flames had spread, turning most of the fourth floor of the
mall into a crimson sea. Lumian released his accumulated spirituality
and once again flashed behind the "reanimated" female corpse.

Instead of directly swinging the Sword of Courage, he pushed his left
palm forward.

At some point, his palm had already been gripping a cheap silver and
black bracelet, while his eyes showed a silver-black hue, with what
seemed like an illusory long river flowing slowly inside.

The reanimated female corpse didn't hesitate. Following the prompting of
her spiritual intuition, she was about to actively trigger a Mirror
Substitution.

At this moment, the toxic thick smoke produced by the burning entered
her throat, while the high temperature caused her black hair to start
self-igniting.

These environmentally-induced problems made the reanimated female corpse
instinctively shrink her body, slowing her down by a beat.

Magnified Fate!

Lumian had already used Magnified Fate twice before, without achieving
satisfactory results. The Weakening pathogen he had secretly spread,
which could survive for a longer time in high-temperature flames, also
hadn't worked as he had expected, only imperceptibly accelerating the
rate of the reanimated female corpse's spirituality consumption.

Now, taking advantage of the environmental changes brought by the
long-burning fierce flames, he finally grasped the opportunity,
successfully turning the corresponding stream of fate into the main
trunk.

As the reanimated female corpse slightly shrank her body, the crimson
flames covering the surface of the Sword of Courage suddenly
extinguished, revealing the iron-black metal blade beneath.

Parts of this blade were smooth and flat, reflecting the silhouette of
the reanimated female corpse.

In the next second, the black Flames of Destruction that Lumian had
condensed in advance fell onto the metal "mirror surface" and drilled
into it.

Unable to use a Mirror Substitution in time, the reanimated female
corpse let out a painful sound. Her body shattered with a crack,
re-outlining at the edge of the crimson hell. However, the black flames
that erupted from inside to outside, hiding ferocity and terror,
continued to burn her, only partially extinguished.

Once a Demoness of Despair's curse succeeded, the characteristic that it
couldn't be transferred by substitutes when suppressed to Sequence 7
level became a situation where a substitute could only transfer part of
the curse damage.

*Crack! Crack! Crack!*

The reanimated female corpse consecutively triggered Mirror
Substitutions, finally escaping Lumian's curse.

But at this moment, Lumian directly teleported in front of her and asked
with a smile, "How many Mirror Substitutions do you have left?"

As he spoke, he had already swung the Sword of Courage.

The reanimated female corpse was dazzled by that charming smile, only
reacting when the Sword of Courage was near. She quickly lunged to the
side.

She had no more Mirror Substitutions left!

She was fast, but Lumian was faster. His wrist paused, and the Sword of
Courage cleaved the air, creating an explosive sound.

*Boom!*

Crimson flames burst open, directly engulfing the reanimated female
corpse.

Although this explosion only had Sequence 7 power, it was enough to
severely injure a Demoness without Mirror Substitutions!

Bang! The reanimated female corpse was slammed heavily against the wall,
her bones breaking and blood spurting from her mouth.

Water-like waves rippled over her body, stripping away her beautiful
appearance and revealing an expressionless, ordinary-looking young man.

Lumian frowned slightly and swung his sword down again.

With a rolling sound, the young man's head tumbled to the side amid a
spray of blood.

His body, along with his head and the splattered blood, instantly
vanished like an illusion, never to appear again.

"A deep mirror image of the real female corpse?" Lumian had seen similar
gender-reversed Mirror People in Fourth Epoch Trier.

The special mirror world fragments in Franca and Jenna's possession
could also create similar deep mirror images, with strength nearly
perfectly replicated and certain special characteristics.

Thinking of this, Lumian suddenly raised his head, looking towards the
surveillance camera obscured by smoke.

He suspected that the reanimated female corpse also had a special mirror
world fragment!

___

Inside the surveillance room.

The infected Franca and Jenna were growing increasingly weak, their
movements inevitably affected to some extent.

Just as the reanimated female corpse was about to seize the opportunity
to destroy the surveillance screen, she suddenly felt something leap
towards her from the side.

It was Ludwig, crouched like a frog.

He had emerged from the mirror world at some unknown time.

The reanimated female corpse instinctively thrust an ice crystal spear
towards Ludwig.

Ludwig suddenly opened his mouth wide, his mouth corners splitting to
the back of his head.

His two rows of sharp teeth then closed, biting the tip of the spear.

Immediately after, he quickly sucked in a breath through his mouth.

He completed a Deprivation through the ice crystal spear connecting him
and the reanimated female corpse.

What he Deprived was the Mirror Substitution!

Currently only at Sequence 7 level, he could only Deprive one ability
from the enemy, and only for one minute, so Anthony had him choose
Mirror Substitution.

*"Attack with full force,"* Anthony's voice then sounded in
Franca and Jenna's ears.

Franca didn't ask why, immediately raising the Inevitable Gun, aiming at
the reanimated female corpse, and pulling the trigger.

A dark yellow bullet flew out with a bang.

Sure Hit!
