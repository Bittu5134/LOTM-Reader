## Chapter 835: Source of Corruption

As soon as Lumian's fingers touched the glossy black bone ring, he felt
searing pain spread from the point of contact throughout his entire
body.

He looked down to see thin wisps of purple-blue sulfur flames emerging
from every pore, charring the surrounding skin bit by bit and giving off
a pungent odor.

This pain was so familiar to Lumian that he merely furrowed his brow
slightly, gritted his teeth, his expression barely changing.

He then took out the Devil's Whispers bone ring, slipping it onto his
right ring finger with the twisted, agonized Devil's face facing up.

Lumian's gaze turned icy cold, a deep blackness forming in his blue
irises that no light could penetrate.

The malice within him rapidly swelled, overwhelming the Ascetic's
tolerance and clashing fiercely with his own will in a fragile balance,
the excess spilling outward.

Lumian took out some Ice Lemon Fish fillets from his Traveler's Bag,
stuffing them into his mouth and chewing to temporarily boost his fire
resistance a bit. At the same time, he sensed the surrounding malice.

He was searching for the Mirror Person Guei!

One negative effect of the Devil's Whispers was that it made the wearer
and anyone within a hundred meters more prone to malicious thoughts and
impulsive actions. And since Mirror People tended toward extremism and
distortion to begin with, they would be even more obviously affected.

With this premise, the Devil's Whispers also granted the Malice
Perception ability, allowing the wearer to sense if those around them
harbored ill intent. It could not detect dangers in their brewing stages
like a true Devil, but it was still a mystical form of perception.

As long as the Mirror Person developed malicious intentions toward him
within a certain distance, Lumian believed he could use Malice
Perception to pinpoint their location!

Sulfur flames slowly burning across his body, Lumian's icy gaze swept
the surrounding area littered with corpses clad in iron-black full-body
armor amid smoldering fires, remnants of some recent slaughter.

Faint, nearly invisible flames also flickered at various points on the
corpse mountain itself.

They illuminated the wasteland and sky, preventing total darkness from
taking hold and allowing Lumian, Albus, and Celeste to remain visible
despite no longer holding their carbide lamps or lanterns.

After just a second or two, the corners of Lumian's mouth curled into a
cruel, cold smile.

He sensed intense malice directed at him from about ten meters behind
and to the side!

It emanated from a corpse---no, from the smooth, mirror-black
breastplate on the corpse.

*Found you...* Without turning around, Lumian abruptly
teleported to the corpse's side amid his slow movements and activated
the Mirror Cufflink.

Through the metal mirror's surface, Mirror Person Guei peered outward
from within the black breastplate.

After discovering the two Demonesses had used the mirror world to reach
this area, he had slipped out quietly, leaving it to Julie and Celeste.

He wasn't worried they would beat him to 0-01, since based on his
knowledge and on-site investigations, he believed no one could gain
0-01's approval before its agent Wanak was eliminated. Brute force or
exploiting loopholes would achieve nothing until the "throne" was vacant
and chaos ensued, giving others an opportunity.

Guei felt relieved he had made this wise choice, having directly
experienced the mirror world projection's destruction just now.

A mere aftershock of that apocalyptic scene could have vaporized him
instantly.

Confirming Wanak's death, he then slipped back through an ordinary
mirror world to the corpse mountain's vicinity, seeking a chance to gain
0-01's approval and take it for himself.

He saw Julie turning to filthy blood and fall, Albus Medici transforming
into a fiery spear to stop it, Celeste screaming Albus's name in
anguish, and Lumian Lee calmly putting on the ring, preparing to make
his entrance and reap the spoils of victory.

An intense malice welled up within Guei: *You're all obstructing me from
completing my mission!*

After entering Morora as one of the rare Readers turned Mirror Person,
Guei had initially felt confident, supplementing his knowledge at the
Knowledge Cathedral while conducting field investigations to gather
intel for his final operation.

But after covertly observing the capabilities of Albus Medici, Wanak,
Julie, and Lumian Lee, Guei began doubting himself.

*Which of them could I actually defeat one-on-one by exploiting the
special mirror world's power? Probably only Lumian Lee, the one my
superior warned me to watch out for...*

*And when it comes to learning speed, although I far outpace Lumian, it
seems I can't handle nearly as much corruption as him...*

*Am I really the one with the least hope among these people?*

Shaken by these doubts, Guei devised a plan to lurk in the shadows,
using his special nature to emerge once the heavyweights had clashed and
weakened each other, then sweep up the remains.

So far, his plan had progressed smoothly.

The biggest obstacle, Wanak, and the most dangerous threat, Julie, were
dead, their souls completely extinguished with no chance of revival
through 0-01's leaking power as undead beings!

*Once Albus Medici and Celeste decide the winner between them, I can
join the fray, kill the survivor, and take on the weakest Lumian Lee
alone...*

*Should I, should I ambush Lumian while he's off-guard? He's no Demoness
or Mirror Person, with no substitute active, a single hit could kill him
for real...*

These malicious thoughts grew clearer and stronger in Guei's mind.

But before he could decide, Lumian's figure abruptly enlarged, appearing
right before his eyes.

Then Lumian vanished from his sight.

In his place, a viscous pool of black liquid emerged underfoot, as if
the deepest, most vile desires of the human heart had taken physical
form.

Desire Incarnation!

The black liquid suddenly surged upward, enveloping Guei.

*Crack!*

The sound of shattering glass came from within the inky fluid as Guei's
silhouette appeared on the edge of the dim, empty space behind the metal
mirror.

He saw the liquid rapidly coalescing into Lumian's form, chuckling
coldly with a fondness of teaching others. "Didn't know I had a Mirror
Substitution, did you?"

A direct attack like this only costs me one mirror.

Before the words had left his mouth, an exceptionally violent emotion
welled up within Guei.

He instinctively reached for his neck, feeling warm blood.

Pain immediately lanced into his mind.

*Crack!*

Guei deliberately triggered his own Mirror Substitution, shattering
countless shards of glass that rained to the ground.

His silhouette now flickered in another corner behind the mirror, but a
thin, deep bloody gash remained on his neck.

His emotions had become completely frenzied, vicious, and insane. His
facial skin rapidly aged and withered like patches of brown tree bark.
The words "my child, my child" echoed in his ears as flesh rippled on
either shoulder, seeming to sprout additional heads.

His abdomen slowly swelled while his eyes took on a silvery-white with
streaks of black. His aura rapidly dissipated as his body visibly
decayed, chunks of flesh sloughing off and wriggling like maggots...

Lumian saw the various corruptions afflicting him directly manifested in
this stark way.

It was a veritable smorgasbord!

When he used Desire Incarnation, that inky black pool didn't just
contain his own emotions and desires, but also those from the corruptive
emotions and desires deeply influencing him.

These higher-level corruptions would be difficult for any non-godhood
being to resist---even Saints would suffer serious effects!

Facing such potent corruption, failure to proactively trigger one's
Mirror Substitution immediately would be too late once the viscous fluid
made contact. By then, it would already have tainted the target!

Now Guei was a horrifically corrupted monstrosity.

Seeing the Mirror Person degenerating toward an unspeakable form, Lumian
had the intuition that continuing to observe might catalyze a similar
transformation within himself.

He immediately stepped back, leaving the metal mirror surface to return
to the corpse and surrounding wasteland at the base of the corpse
mountain.

He then saw the smooth mirror-like surface of his chest plate, with
tendrils of black mist seeping out, like illusory shadows seeming to try
and grasp him.

Lumian swiftly turned his body and sprinted toward the corpse mountain
peak.

Sometimes transforming into a blazing-white flaming spear to propel
himself forward, sometimes teleporting dozens of meters, he continually
climbed upward through the mountain formed of corpses and bones,
scattered with lingering embers.

He aimed to lead the out-of-control, collapsing Mirror Person Guei,
corrupted into monstrosity, to Albus Medici and Celeste, telling them
"you're welcome."

Whether climbing by hand and foot, using his contracted abilities for
short-range teleports, or ascending in flaming spear form, Lumian felt
an immense oppressive presence behind him. An indescribable, constantly
shifting black shadow was cast onto him and his path ahead, inevitably
filling him with fear.

He now had no way to know what horrific form the pursuing monster had
taken or what state it was in---he only knew for certain it was not
something a normal human should observe or discern.

Suddenly, Guei's deep voice rang in his ears: "Mommy..."

*Mommy...* Lumian's mouth twitched, realizing that even with all
the strange corruptions on himself, the one from the Great Mother, from
the Omebella bloodline, still stood out as the most exceptional---after
all, Mr. Fool had left behind a seal, not a corruption.

Lumian fled even faster.

Finally, he saw the summit of the corpse mountain peak, Celeste and
Albus Medici.
