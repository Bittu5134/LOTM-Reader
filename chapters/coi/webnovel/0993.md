## Chapter 993: Important Person

At Xinhong District, in the rented apartment.

Franca recounted the results of Luo Shan's observations and the
questions she raised, finally saying, "The more I think about it, the
more I feel something is amiss. The Major Arcana clearly mentioned in
their materials that Mr. Fool went to sleep to fight against the
Celestial Worthy's consciousness, so why are they solely focused on
awakening Mr. Fool instead of helping to weaken the Celestial Worthy?
And we too, with sufficient background information, never considered
this direction before. It's as if we've been bewitched, no, as if we've
been hit with a spell of stupidity..."

At this point, Franca suddenly paused.

Everyone present instantly thought of one word: Fooled!

In the unspeakable silence, only Ludwig was completely unaffected,
munching on his boiled corn.

After serious contemplation, Jenna said, "Perhaps the act of awakening
Mr. Fool itself will weaken the Celestial Worthy and strengthen our
advantage."

Lumian shook his head. "Even if this symbolism holds true, we shouldn't
have completely overlooked the direction of weakening the Celestial
Worthy to help Mr. Fool awaken."

"Does that mean this direction is correct? So the dream fooled everyone
to prevent us from thinking in this direction." Franca suddenly became
excited.

"Not necessarily," Anthony replied, "That Celestial Worthy is the being
at the very top of the Swindler pathway. Initially fooling us to prevent
us from considering the possibility of weakening Him might be to make us
believe it's the only correct path after we've made some progress in our
later explorations, causing us to rush headlong into it."

"The enemy's opposition indicates we're doing the right thing, but what
if the enemy is deliberately opposing... Feigning weakness when actually
strong..." Franca understood Anthony's meaning and said frustratedly,
"How should we choose?"

"Why choose?" Lumian laughed, "Awakening Mr. Fool and weakening the
Celestial Worthy are two things we can do simultaneously."

He stood up and began pacing in the small living room, speaking as he
walked, "Let's re-analyze the possible goals Zaratulstra wanted to
achieve with those actions:

"Contacting Zhou Mingrui was likely to find a way to make Zhou Mingrui
drink the subsequent potion, become a Witch, thus creating a fixed,
long-term Mirror Person, and to some extent shake Zhou Mingrui's
self-perception;

"The merger and restructuring negotiations with the Intis Group were to
obtain more money and resources, and using the mirrored Roselle to erode
and influence Huang Tao was likely for the same purpose;

"Eliminating and replacing the dream manifestations related to Gehrman
Sparrow's life experiences might be to weaken The World, indirectly
weakening Mr. Fool...

"These actions currently don't show any intent to awaken the Celestial
Worthy, though accumulating money and resources could barely count..."

As Jenna, Franca, and Anthony nodded slightly, Lumian began to
contradict himself, "No, creating a fixed Mirror Person for Zhou Mingrui
could also be for the Celestial Worthy to gain more initiative through
the Mirror Person, gradually gain the upper hand, and thus awaken.
Eliminating the dream manifestations related to Gehrman Sparrow is to
weaken Mr. Fool, but replacing them with his own people and taking away
Jia Yu is to later confuse the real with the fake, making The World
identity point to the Celestial Worthy instead of Mr. Fool? This is also
a kind of awakening...

"However, these awakenings all come with weakening Mr. Fool, the two
can't be separated."

Lumian's point was that both weakening the Celestial Worthy and
awakening Mr. Fool need to be done, and sometimes they are actually
different aspects of the same thing.

Franca concurred succinctly, "But how can we weaken the Celestial
Worthy?"

The Major Arcana card holders didn't know about the Celestial Worthy's
past situation, nor did they mention which character in the dream city
was closely related to the Celestial Worthy. Franca couldn't find a
target to weaken the Celestial Worthy, there was no starting point.

"Currently, only Peng Deng is suspected to be related to the Celestial
Worthy, but it can't be confirmed yet," Anthony said."What can be
confirmed is that Peng Deng definitely has a special status in the dream
city," Lumian nodded slightly.

This conclusion was drawn from Anthony's encounter and Peng Deng's
rental of the magic mirror Arrodes.

Lumian then said, "Actually, there is one place that can be confirmed to
be closely related to the Celestial Worthy."

Seeing Franca and Jenna's thoughtful expressions, Lumian directly gave
the answer.

"Mushu Hospital!

"Without a close relationship, without a prior cooperation intention,
the Celestial Worthy wouldn't send the corpses of Gehrman
Sparrow-related dream manifestations to the underground morgue of Mushu
Hospital, letting them 'reborn' there, and that kind of 'rebirth' would
also cause the corresponding manifestation to completely become the
Celestial Worthy's sole puppet."

"The underground part of Mushu Hospital..." Franca said, unable to help
but draw in a sharp breath.

That was where the psychological trauma of a great existence
materialized, the key node for other great existences to infiltrate
their power, the place where the Celestial Worthy created exclusive
marionettes, a place that even Sequence 0 true gods dared not easily
intrude!

Lumian chuckled in response. "I'll be contacting an important person
from Mushu Hospital tonight to see if I can obtain any useful
intelligence."

Late at night.

Luo Shan still chose to lie down on the bed, trying to enter deep sleep.

If the world doesn't explode, I won't take a holiday. Even if this is
really a dream, before the dream shatters, I still have to go to work
when I need to... Luo Shan murmured, half self-mockingly and half
self-comfortingly.

Then, she closed her eyes, and after a long while, finally suppressed
her troubled thoughts and emotions, falling asleep.

This time, after falling asleep, she didn't immediately enter her Shaman
world to continue guarding the semi-transparent barrier, but became
muddle-headed, just like when she slept before becoming a Beyonder.

She vaguely heard a voice echoing in her ears:

"Truth can become false, falsehood can become true. The Celestial Worthy
of Heaven and Earth for Blessings...

"Truth can become false, falsehood can become true. The Celestial Worthy
of Heaven and Earth for Blessings..."

___

At the edge of Crimson Moon Hospital, in a secluded corner growing many
mushrooms.

Lumian, transformed into a Demoness of Despair and dressed in a blouse,
patiently waited for a while. He saw Grimm suddenly appear not far ahead
with a person, as if walking into the real area from another world.

"Respected Child of God, this is Lu Yong'an, the dean of obstetrics at
Mushu Hospital," Grimm introduced his companion, "She is also a child of
the Mother."

Lu Yong'an appeared to be in her forties, with fair skin and a beautiful
face, round like the full moon, looking gentle and motherly.

She was carrying a medical box and bowed slightly to Lumian, saying,
"Praise the Mother, and praise you, Child of God."

The important person from Mushu Hospital that Lumian had previously said
he wanted to meet was precisely this obstetrics dean, Lu Yong'an---Grimm
was very true to his word. As soon as the one-week deadline was met, he
sent a message to Lumian, reminding him that tonight he should go help
Li Keji with reproduction, both mystically and scientifically.

Lumian hadn't rushed to abort the fetus in Li Keji's belly, precisely
because he wanted to fool Grimm first, to avoid reaching the point of
needing to put on an act to cover up. After this, he would have at least
two to three weeks to perform the abortion.

Hearing Lu Yong'an's greeting, Lumian, with his long black hair, nodded
slightly and said, "Let's go in and take care of business first."

He didn't rush to inquire about the internal affairs of Mushu Hospital
from Lu Yong'an.

This had to be done slowly, with proper groundwork, thinking through
which things the Child of God should already know and not need to ask
about.

"Yes, Child of God," Grimm and Lu Yong'an responded in unison, their
expressions turning serious.

Lumian walked towards them and grabbed their shoulders.

Then, he activated the black mark on his right shoulder, using Spirit
World Traversal to appear directly in Li Keji's hospital room.

Li Keji, who had been touching his belly lost in thought, sat up
straight, and the jellyfish-like mushroom on the ceiling sank down
slightly.

Seeing Li Keji looking at him with slight surprise, Lumian winked his
left eye at him, hinting that there was a reason for this and to play
along for now.

Li Keji showed an expression of sudden realization. "You're here to help
me?"

Hearing these words, Grimm couldn't help but turn his head to look at
the Child of God's stunningly beautiful face:

When did she manage to deceive Li Keji?

Grimm and Lu Yong'an had both anticipated needing to use their abilities
to control the target.

Lu Yong'an sat down beside Li Keji's bed with her medical box and began
a serious examination.

After nearly a minute, she turned her head and said, "The fetus is very
healthy and developing well and quickly."

Grimm immediately gave a thumbs up to the Child of God, praising again,
"As expected of you!"

Lumian was already numb to this, nodding slightly, focusing intently on
watching Lu Yong'an take out a syringe, draw some kind of drug, and give
Li Keji an injection in the belly.

Then, Lu Yong'an's maternal radiance became even more obvious as she
began to virtually caress Li Keji's belly with both hands.

Lumian saw Li Keji's belly begin to swell and enlarge at a visible rate.
In just a minute or two, it looked like a six-month pregnancy.

"I can feel her heartbeat." Li Keji touched his belly again.

Lu Yong'an put away her instruments and drugs, and smiled at Lumian.

"Child of God, come again in two weeks and we can enter the stage of
imminent birth."

"Excellent." Lumian nodded insincerely.

I'll abort it shortly! The earlier it's aborted, the safer!

"We'll be leaving now." Lumian gave Li Keji another meaningful look.

Then, he teleported back to the previous secluded corner with Lu
Yong'an, who had walked back, and Grimm, who was already by his side.

Lumian didn't give Grimm and Lu Yong'an a chance to say goodbye and
leave. He looked at the latter, slightly raising his chin, and said,
"How are things going inside Mushu Hospital?"

He planned to ask vaguely at first, in the tone of a Child of God
wanting to get feedback from his subordinates, and then selectively
delve deeper based on Lu Yong'an's response.

Lu Yong'an replied with a kindly manner mixed with obvious respect, "The
underground area is almost finished being renovated, and above ground
it's still just us few and those who frequently enter and exit the
underground."

The underground is almost "renovated"? Those who frequently enter and
exit the underground don't count as people? Lumian raised an eyebrow.
