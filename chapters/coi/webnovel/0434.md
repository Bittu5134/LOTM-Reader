## Chapter 434: Utilizing the Special Environment

In a dim tunnel supported by stone pillars, Franca, indifferent to the
presence of carbide lamps, turned to Lumian and expressed her concern.

"Are you absolutely sure there won't be any issues with using that heart
to advance? Even if you don't appear afraid of the Sauron family's
curse, it could still affect your condition after consuming the potion
and potentially lead to failure. Honestly, Gardner's proposal is worth
considering. Consuming an additional Sequence 9 to Sequence 7 potion
will make you stronger, but not by much. There won't be any qualitative
changes, so it's better to take a safer route."

The Demoness of Pleasure had already learned about Lumian's experiences
in Red Swan Castle's underground maze and most of the information from
Madam Magician's letter.

While she was awed by the special soldiers' existence and the frenzied
cries of the uncontrollable Angel, she couldn't help but be concerned
about Lumian's plan to use the Beyonder characteristic of the wax statue
artisan and the shriveled heart of the mutated black spider to concoct
the potion.

Lumian, holding a carbide lamp, chuckled.

"I'm doing it because I'm more than confident."

Franca remained skeptical. "Do you have a method to negate the influence
of the heart's remaining bloodline?"

At this point, it was as if she snapped out of her reverie.

"Where are we headed? Aren't you going to drink the potion? Just find a
quiet spot. There's no need to keep wandering underground, right?"

Lumian chuckled.

"It's precisely because the destination is special that I believe I can
minimize the influence of the Sauron family's residual bloodline in the
heart."

Simultaneously, it would reduce the risk of the corruption in his body
during the advancement!

Franca's curiosity was piqued. "Where are we going?"

Lumian replied with a smile, "You'll find out when we get there."

"Dammit! I hate people like you who leave sentences hanging!" Franca
couldn't resist cursing.

___

After more than half an hour, Franca pointed ahead to a naturally formed
and modified stone door cave, her expression a mix of surprise and
realization. She asked, "Is this the destination you were talking
about?"

The entrance was marked with numerous engravings of skulls, skeletal
arms, sunflowers, and symbols related to steam.

This marked the entrance to the catacombs, leading to the Death Empire!

"Somewhere inside," Lumian replied. He retrieved a white candle from the
satchel containing the Flog boxing gloves and tossed it to Franca. With
a smile, he added, "I want to consume the potion under the watchful eyes
of God."

"Under the gaze of God?" Franca eyed Lumian suspiciously, wondering if
he had succumbed to the peculiar habits of an Astrologer.

He didn't seem to be speaking in a straightforward manner!

Lumian chose not to elaborate. Instead, he lit a white candle and
ventured into the catacombs.

As usual, the administrators challenged them, and they made their
assurances. The two eventually reached the third level of the catacombs,
where they encountered a sacrificial pillar composed of two weathered
boulders, surrounded by a small square.

Upon entering this remarkably clean area, Franca had an epiphany.

"Are you trying to exploit the uniqueness of this place?"

She had previously explored the catacombs but hadn't ventured deep into
the third level. Lumian had only mentioned that there was a square here
with two sacrificial pillars symbolizing the Eternal Blazing Sun and the
God of Steam and Machinery.

Under the protection of these two pillars, even if the candle flames in
their hands were extinguished, the individuals in the square wouldn't be
plunged into darkness, and there wouldn't be any trace of their presence
erased.

"Yes." Lumian smiled.

He handed the white candle to Franca and approached the mottled pillar
adorned with symbols like the Sun Sacred Emblem, sunflowers, and
radiating lines. He extended his arms reverently and offered a sincere
prayer.

"Praise the Sun!"

His plan was to utilize the catacombs' uniqueness and the protective
power of the sacrificial square to suppress the influence of the Sauron
family's residual bloodline and the corruption of Inevitability within
his body.

From his experiences, a substantial part of these influences stemmed
from external sources and the outside world. For instance, the sealed
Vermonda Sauron deep within the underground palace and the power of
Inevitability beyond the barrier.

Without these external influences, all that would remain was the
corruption within his body. Lumian had endured this during his previous
three advancements and believed it was manageable. This was because the
external support this corruption received would be weakened by the
catacombs' uniqueness and the protection of the sacrificial pillars.

The initial idea for this plan had been inspired by the creation of the
Beyonder accessory, Beatrice's Necklace. Madam Magician had mentioned
that specific environments could sever connections and prevent the power
of a boon from returning to its source, such as the area around the
Samaritan Women's Spring.

Lumian believed that although the sacrificial square in the catacombs
might not be as special as the area around the Samaritan Women's Spring,
it wouldn't be too far off. After considering the catacombs' peculiarity
and the protection of the Eternal Blazing Sun sacrificial pillar, the
external influence would undoubtedly be significantly reduced.

Furthermore, the sanctity of the sacrificial square stemmed from the
protection of orthodox gods. Lumian didn't need to worry about any
backlash from consuming the potion to advance here.

Franca watched in momentary surprise as Lumian genuinely praised the
Sun.

He was truly under the "watchful eye" of a deity!

*But isn't he afraid of being directly purged as a follower of Mr.
Fool?*

After the prayer, Lumian returned to Franca and handed her an exquisite
perfume bottle.

"What's this?" Franca inquired, puzzled.

"Gray amber perfume," Lumian explained with a flicker of emotion in his
eyes under the candlelight. "After I consume the potion, watch my
reaction closely. If you sense anything amiss, unscrew the cap and bring
the bottle to my nose."

Initially, he would have done this himself, but this time, given the
influence of the Sauron family's residual bloodline and his status as a
Mid-Sequence Beyonder, he was concerned that the situation might worsen.
He might not have the strength to open the perfume bottle. Additionally,
if he had used it from the beginning, his subconscious might remember
that he had created it, potentially negating the intended effect.

"Alright." Seeing that Lumian had no intention of explaining, Franca
suppressed her curiosity and refrained from inquiring.

Lumian glanced at the broad stone steps leading to the catacombs' second
level and added,

"One more thing, you need to ensure that the tourists don't disturb me."

"Do you think I'm stupid?" Franca rolled her eyes.

*Did you really need to ask?*

Without further delay, Lumian retrieved a beer mug with a crystal-like
appearance from his satchel.

Using a measuring cylinder, he began the process. First, he poured a
total of 80 milliliters of the wax statue artisan's dark-red blood into
the mug. Then, he added the mutated black spider's poison gland, 10
grams of amber powder, and two white oak fruits he had collected over a
month ago.

These ingredients, infused with potent spirituality and corresponding
symbols, didn't dissolve instantly; instead, they created a dark foam on
the surface.

Lumian gently submerged the blood-colored object that resembled a
shrunken human brain and the withered, black heart into the mixture.

With a sizzling sound, a crimson-tinged mist diffused and then receded.
All the solid ingredients rapidly disintegrated and merged, causing the
potion's color to intensify.

Bubbles rose and burst until the liquid inside the beer mug turned an
iron-black hue, with a tinge of reddish rust.

Observing this transformation, Franca mumbled softly, "Indeed, one's
heart is tainted when one employs battle strategies. Even the potion is
tainted..."

Contemplating the dark, blood-colored concoction, Lumian removed his
satchel and military flask, setting them aside.

After handing Lie to Franca, he took a slow, deliberate breath and
composed himself.

After 20 to 30 seconds, he sat cross-legged, his wrist steady as he
picked up the beer mug and drank the potion without hesitation.

The potion had a strong rusty taste, cold like a serpent slithering in
the darkness, slippery and icy.

However, Lumian's body didn't burn as it had before. Instead, he felt a
chilling sensation, as if all the flames had been absorbed by the
potion.

Simultaneously, his head throbbed with a familiar pain, and his vision
quickly blurred. All the thoughts and information he knew materialized,
intertwining in the form of miniature pictures, forming layers of
interconnected spiderwebs.

This tore Lumian's mind apart. Terrifying ravings, seemingly emanating
from an infinite distance while simultaneously echoing in his ears, were
accompanied by violent and frenzied emotions.

Yet, the pain from the former didn't render Lumian nearly unconscious.
He instinctively rolled, his expression involuntarily contorted with
malevolence. His hands clenched tightly, and he couldn't help but groan
in pain. The latter was within the tolerance of an Alms Monk.

Lumian's right palm felt a slight warmth from the stimulation.

Finally, the inferno reached him. This time, it converged within
Lumian's mind, unreal and illusory.

Franca, who had been watching closely, wanted to open the perfume bottle
several times, but each time she thought about it, Lumian returned to
normal.

The entire ordeal lasted only 20 to 30 seconds. Lumian's clenched hands
slowly relaxed, and his contorted facial muscles gradually returned to
their original positions.

*Phew...* Lumian exhaled a scorching breath and opened his eyes.

"Did it work?" Franca asked subconsciously.

Lumian, experiencing sharp pain in his head and body, responded with a
wry smile, "If it hadn't worked, you would've already started fighting
the out-of-control me."

This had been even easier than his previous three advancements.

"Who knows if a Conspirer's loss of control is an act of pretending to
be a normal person and secretly attacking me..." Franca couldn't help
but argue, even though she knew she had spoken out of turn.

Lumian raised his hand to rub his temples. Despite the pain, his
thoughts seemed clearer than ever.

He quickly recalled the events that had occurred and sensed that some of
the details might be problematic.

This was something he hadn't noticed before.

For instance, according to his nightmares, Iraeta, the poet who
frequently participated in King's Pie games, should have transformed
into a half-wax statue, gone insane, harmed himself or those around him
at any moment. Yet, not only was he unscathed, but he had also entered
the problematic Sacred Heart Cloister and coincidentally encountered
Albus Medici!
