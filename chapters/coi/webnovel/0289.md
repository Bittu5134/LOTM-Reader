## Chapter 289: Late Night Visitors

"Doctor?" Lumian recalled the two canisters of Healing Agent obtained
from the Poison Spur Mob.

Their healing effects were quite impressive indeed.

Leaning back in his chair, Lumian gazed intently into Lugano Toscano's
eyes, pondering silently for some time.

Gradually Lugano grew uneasy, his body tensing up.

Finally Lumian smiled.

"Salle de Gristmill isn't my property. I'm just managing it for the
Boss.

"I'm not sure you can handle it, but I'll give you a chance."

Lugano visibly relaxed and smiled. "Boss, I won't let you down!"

Lumian raised his voice to call Louis over.

"From now on, you'll be Lugano's deputy at the Gristmill. Manage it
together."

*Is this for real? But why give an untested new recruit such an
important post?* Before Louis could react, Lumian had already
turned to Lugano.

"You have two months. You and your friends will be the dance hall's
protectors for now. Take a portion of the profits; negotiate the details
with the manager."

He deliberately left the profit distribution vague, especially his own
cut. He wanted to see what Lugano would do.

"Thank you, Boss!" Lugano's joy was unconcealed.

He nearly blurted out, "Once I'm a Doctor, I'll treat any illness or
injury you have." But that felt like cursing misfortune upon Lumian, so
he quickly sealed his lips.

Watching them leave while discussing the dance hall, Lumian's smile
faded.

Lugano's fawning and zeal made him suspect ulterior motives, like him
with Baron Brignais and the fake diamond necklace.

But Lumian had cowed the Baron by showing his might and madness. The key
was proving the value of exploiting him. Lugano was more focused on
ingratiation. Of course, he had revealed his usefulness too.

That's why Lumian decided to give him Salle de Gristmill for two
months---to monitor any abnormalities and act quickly if the bounty
hunter had hidden motives. Or gain a Doctor cheaply if he was clean.

Either way, it wouldn't cost Lumian anything. Salle de Gristmill
belonged to the Savoie Mob; he would just lose some of his own share.
That could be offset by Lugano stabilizing the unruly dance hall.

After sitting awhile, Lumian left for Room 207 at Auberge du Coq Doré.
Drawing the curtains, he sat at the table and began writing.

"Esteemed Madam Magician,

"I've officially joined the Iron Blood Cross Order.

"The initiation ritual was...

"I'm puzzled. The Order has members clearly not from the Hunter pathway.
How did they pass the vigil? Assassins? Or did Gardner confirm their
trustworthiness some other way, bypassing corruption?"

He almost asked about entering 13 Avenue du Marché at special times, but
that was surely monitored by official Beyonders. It was unlikely anyone
could approach then.

After neatly folding the letter, Lumian summoned the doll messenger on
the altar.

Wary, he asked, "Am I still being watched?"

"No," the doll slowly shook her head.

Relieved, Lumian scheduled reporting to Mr. K and heading to The Fool's
cathedral for a sermon.

After nearly fifteen minutes, Madam Magician replied:

"I once heard from Mr. Fool's Oracle that a friend of his was originally
in the Iron and Blood Cross Order but couldn't stand it and fled to sea.

"I didn't understand at first, but now I see---it's been hard on you."

*It wasn't so bad. Watching them perform was rather interesting, a study
in human diversity...* Lumian didn't see an issue with it.

Something else concerned him more.

When mentioning the Oracle, Madam Magician didn't say "one of."

Lumian suspected Mr. Fool had only a single Oracle!

Meaning the Major Arcana card holders of the Divine Council weren't
considered Oracles.

Pondering this, Lumian read on:

"They might be Assassins or used another corruption method.

"Remind the Two of Cups---if accepting the vigil, bring the ancient
underground mirror. Other than keeping in mind not to respond, it's best
to bring the ancient mirror that provides entry into the underground
mirror world. Hunter/Demoness corruption likely differs. It may help."

That mirror... Mulling it over, Lumian swiftly burned the letter in
crimson flames.

Just as he was about to wash up, he sensed something and glanced at the
door.

A series of knocks promptly came.

"Who is it?" he called.

A strained voice answered, "Guess who I am."

Seated, Lumian looked helplessly at the bedbug-free ceiling. "Come in."

As expected, it was Franca and Jenna, dressed as Assassins.

"Here to play Fighting Evil?" he joked.

Franca scoffed, "I don't play cards with sore losers like you."

Having tricked many into drinking excessively over card games recently,
Lumian had been winning at Fighting Evil with the ladies and mocking
their poor skills. Suspecting cheating, Franca had intensely coached her
dancers the past few days.

Entering, Franca added, "We're here to borrow mysticism magazines."

Lumian sneered. "Nice try. Why come so late just for that? Is waiting
till morning not an option? Jenna doesn't seem the studying type."

He smiled. "What's really going on?"

The two gritted their teeth in sync.

After Franca shut the door, Jenna glanced around and whispered, "Are the
walls too thin here? Could neighbors overhear us?"

Lumian smiled approvingly. "You're learning---thinking about
eavesdroppers now. Not like before, blabbing recklessly without a care."

*Before...* Franca's suspicious gaze shifted from Jenna to
Lumian, then from Lumian to Jenna.

"Dammit! "We didn't discuss anything important!" Jenna defended. "Why
not mention Charlie? He spills secrets immediately."

*Charlie?* Franca's frown faded.

"It was fine---others were asleep or gone. That's why I didn't stop
him." Lumian stood, ritual dagger in hand. Letting spirituality flow
from the blade, he enveloped the room in a wall of spirituality.

The singing and rowdiness on the streets and the inn's noises instantly
grew distant and muted.

Jenna was amazed. Franca pursed her lips and said to Jenna, "A basic
wall of spirituality ritual. Once you become a Witch, you'll naturally
master it."

At this point, she couldn't help but imagine what Witch Jenna would look
like.

The two ladies sat side by side by Lumian's bed and discussed the
missing Deep Valley Cloister gatekeeper, focused on their quarry
findings tonight.

"What's down there? What should we do?" Franca returned Lumian's
sedative.

Lumian smiled at his companion who wasn't wearing red boots. "Don't you
have an answer already?"

With Franca's experience, she surely had a plan by now.

Franca smiled awkwardly. "Just wanted your thoughts."

"My thoughts?" Lumian joked, "Sneak in while the monk's away for that
20,000 verl d'or!"

Jenna looked around warily. "Meaning it's too dangerous to investigate
further?"

Having heard Lumian's mockery countless times now, she could distinguish
sarcasm, well-meaning teasing, and jokes.

"Right," said Franca. "Recalling the client, there seems to be an
internal Deep Valley Cloister conflict---someone hiding, someone
exposing. Meddling in an orthodox Church's internal conflict is
dangerous for any Beyonder."

"Internal conflict?" Jenna was startled.

Lumian chuckled. "A missing gatekeeper, and some random person offers
20,000 to find him, even just the corpse? And said corpse needs to be
carried to the Deep Valley Cloister. Clearly they want someone to see
it."

Jenna was almost convinced, but she still had a lot of doubts. "B-but
the limbs in the cave seem too sinister for an orthodox Church."
