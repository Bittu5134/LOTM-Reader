## Chapter 1012: A New Round of Hints

Intis Group, Administrative Department.

Zhou Mingrui, wearing a black T-shirt, walked in and casually scanned
the room before saying to Luo Shan, "It's really hot this year. School
has started and there's still no sign of cooling down."

Luo Shan nodded repeatedly in agreement and praised the effectiveness of
the company's air conditioning.

Zhou Mingrui glanced to the side and back, asking, "Luo Fu didn't come
today?"

He had been planning to approach Luo Fu today to ask why she appeared in
the underground area of Mushu Hospital last night. However, it was
almost an hour into the workday and she still hadn't shown up.

Luo Shan looked around and said in a hushed voice, "Luo Fu is going to
resign."

"Hasn't she been working for less than a month? She's resigning before
even passing the probation period?" Zhou Mingrui was somewhat surprised,
but then felt it was also normal.

For a mysterious person like Luo Fu, working at the company was
definitely not for the salary, but for some other purpose. Once that
purpose was achieved, or if she felt it couldn't be completed and she
might be in danger, she would undoubtedly resign without hesitation.

"Yes, there's something going on at home. Otherwise, who would give up
such a good job?" Luo Shan spoke sincerely. "Luo Fu has already
submitted her letter and will come tomorrow to go through the
procedures."

Luo Fu's resignation made Luo Shan feel that she herself probably
wouldn't be fired in the short term.

"She'll come tomorrow?" Zhou Mingrui nodded thoughtfully.

He could foresee that Luo Fu's resignation wouldn't go smoothly. Someone
who had just been hired leaving before completing even a month---wasn't
that a slap in the face for the recruiters?

Moreover, it would affect the HR department's performance evaluation.

Zhou Mingrui then turned to Luo Shan and asked, "How is Luo Fu doing
now? Why did she go to Mushu Hospital last night?"

He spoke with a tone of concern for a colleague.

"She's doing fine now, just hasn't fully recovered emotionally." Without
receiving any "instructions," Luo Shan didn't dare reveal too much.

She directly skipped over the latter question.

Seeing this, Zhou Mingrui politely smiled and said, "Slacking time is
over, I'm going back to work."

"Bye-bye." Luo Shan waved habitually.

Zhou Mingrui turned and walked towards the exit of the Administrative
Department.

Luo Fu's resignation made him more acutely aware of the undercurrents
lurking beneath the surface.

This female colleague seemed to have joined the company specifically for
him. She hadn't even fully familiarized herself with the Administrative
Department's affairs, yet had already had two meals with him, made some
hints, and mysteriously appeared in the underground area of Mushu
Hospital when he was investigating it.

*Did last night's events cause Luo Fu to resign?*

*What exactly is hidden in the underground area of Mushu Hospital, and
why did Luo Fu and Luo Shan go there?*

*What specifically did Luo Fu encounter?*

*Are mystical methods now being used in workplace competition?*

Amidst his lampooning, Zhou Mingrui increasingly wanted to find Luo Fu
and ask her face-to-face.

He felt that the things around him were getting stranger and stranger!

*Luo Fu and Luo Shan too, they clearly showed goodwill and provided
effective hints, so why don't they just tell me the truth about what's
going on?*

*We're all people with supernatural powers, what can't be said?*

*We could be completely open and honest about everything, and discuss
things together. Even if I wouldn't believe everything, I certainly
wouldn't ignore it completely. I'd remember the key points and verify
them one by one in subsequent developments.*

*If they don't explain anything clearly, how am I supposed to help
them?*

*Are we filming a TV drama here, where one misunderstanding can be
dragged out for twenty episodes?*

*Is there a reason they only hint at things instead of speaking
directly?*

*Is some force preventing them from telling the truth about what's
happening?*

*Are there others monitoring me?*

Zhou Mingrui unconsciously raised his head and looked around, but didn't
notice anything unusual.

*Does the monitoring power come from a supernatural level? Can it even
listen in on my private conversations with Luo Fu and Luo Shan?*

*The first time Luo Fu showed something was wrong, Luo Shan hinted for
me to wait two days before talking to her again. That was the day after
my first meal with her, during which Luo Fu had hinted at the existence
of supernatural powers and the hidden dangers of beverages after
Assassin...*

*Was it because she hinted at these things to me that it led to her
subsequent problems?*

Zhou Mingrui returned to his own workstation and sat down, staring at
the screen in front of him, seriously considering how to determine if
there was monitoring around him, and if so, how to avoid it afterwards,
how to meet with Luo Fu and Luo Shan discreetly, and how to communicate
in a safe environment.

In the Administrative Department, Luo Shan picked up her phone and sent
a message to True Hidden Blade: "Zhou Mingrui came to ask about your
situation. He's not unfazed by last night's events, he's just waiting
for an opportunity to inquire."

In the open parking lot below the Tech Building housing Intis Group's
headquarters.

Franca, her hair tied in a ponytail, read the WeChat message sent by Luo
Shan.

She had originally planned to take Ludwig and wait around the Hall Film
Company, ready to help cover up immediately if Dreamscape Jenna made any
mistakes. But after much consideration, she decided to come near the
company instead.

Dreamscape Jenna was "professionally trained," with acting skills no
worse than the real Jenna. She had also inherited Jenna's memories of
applying to the Hall Film Company and signing the contract, and her own
dream was to be a good actress. So, as long as there were no accidents
like last night, she shouldn't have any problems.

Moreover, the Hall Film Company had a good boss who managed things
strictly, and the internal atmosphere was quite good. As long as
Dreamscape Jenna didn't go to outside film crews for auditions, she was
unlikely to encounter the casting couch.

Of course, even if she did, Franca wasn't worried that Dreamscape Jenna
would accept. More than that, she was concerned that Dreamscape Jenna
might overreact, use excessive self-defense, and get arrested by the
police---she had probed Dreamscape Jenna's personality and style this
morning and felt that if Dreamscape Jenna encountered something dirty,
she would grab all the sharp objects she could find at the scene and
make the other party see red.

Comparatively, Luo Shan's situation was more dangerous.

The forces that caused last night's incident had clearly targeted Luo
Shan, and if one attempt failed, there would be another. Franca didn't
want to be careless and have Luo Shan encounter an "accident," die on
the spot, or become a puppet of the Celestial Worthy!

After reading the message from Luo Shan and listening to the sound of
Ludwig eating, Franca pondered for a moment before typing out a
response:

"You can recommend that Zhou Mingrui watch the 'Terminator' series of
films."

Luo Shan was suddenly stunned when she received the reply.

She finally understood why the story Luo Fu had initially made up
sounded so familiar to her!

Most of it was from a movie plot!

*Essentially, it really is a bit similar...* Luo Shan pondered
for a few seconds, then opened her chat with Zhou Mingrui: "We've been
watching old movies lately, the 'Terminator' series. They're much better
than current Hollywood blockbusters. You should rewatch them too."

Zhou Mingrui, receiving this seemingly random message, fell into deep
thought.

He had long forgotten the details of the Terminator series, but still
remembered a bit of the core story.

After a moment, he silently said to himself, *Are they trying to tell me
that I'm the savior?*

Downstairs, in the open parking lot.

Franca alternated between checking her phone and observing the
situation, patiently waiting for the lunch break.

Her biggest worry now wasn't Luo Shan's problem, nor where she should go
to make people despair, but that running the air conditioning in a
gasoline car while waiting wasn't a good thing.

Suddenly, someone opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat.

Franca's spiritual perception had already sensed it was Lumian who had
arrived.

Lumian had changed back to his male form and was in disguise, so he
wouldn't be recognized as security guard Li Ming at first glance.

"How did you know I was here?" Franca asked, both puzzled and curious.

They hadn't even replenished the Mirror Substitutions they had placed
with each other yet!

Lumian smiled, raised his right hand, and pointed to his head. "It's a
simple deduction."

Franca rolled her eyes at him. "I just didn't feel like thinking about
it."

Lumian didn't continue to tease her. He summarized the key points of
what he and the others had discussed with the Major Arcana card holders,
as well as Mr. Fool's past experiences.

"That's truly legendary..." Franca sighed sincerely.

Lumian nodded. "There's another detail. At the time, I was the one who
told Jenna and Luo Shan to ask Zhou Mingrui for help, to make a trip to
the underground area of Mushu Hospital. On the way, Jenna remembered it
was late at night and worried that directly contacting Zhou Mingrui
might cause worse things to happen, so she let Luo Shan go alone.

"Zhou Mingrui agreed to help, and after he ran out of the emergency
center, Jenna was immediately kicked out of the dream. But she hadn't
actually appeared in Zhou Mingrui's sight, and Zhou Mingrui didn't even
know such a person existed."

Franca understood what Lumian was trying to express.

"The Celestial Worthy's gaze can lock onto indirect reminders?

"Then when we have Luo Shan tell Zhou Mingrui the truth, we need to be
prepared for the relevant people to be kicked out of the dream..."

"I was the one who told Luo Shan and Jenna to go, I was the mastermind,
but I wasn't kicked out of the dream," Lumian added.

"Either there's a range or some other limitation on locking onto
indirect reminders, or it's because you were already at B2 of Mushu
Hospital at the time... Can that place affect or interfere with the
Celestial Worthy's gaze?" Franca proposed two possibilities.

Lumian smiled. "If the underground area of Mushu Hospital can indeed
interfere with the Celestial Worthy's gaze to some extent, we might be
able to use that at a critical moment."

This was a collection of details. They might be useful, or they might
have no effect at all, but without collecting them, there wouldn't even
be a chance to test them!

Franca tersely agreed and picked up her phone again, saying, "I should
let Queen Mystic know about the mirrored Emperor Roselle, and remind her
to pay attention to Mr. Huang's contradictory behavior."

After opening the WeChat contact "Bernadette," Franca adjusted her mood
and sent an energetic emoji: "Pop quiz!

"Please answer which five seas are referred to by the Five Seas!"

She wasn't sure if the person on the other end of WeChat was currently
Queen Mystic Bernadette or Miss Bernie Huang, so she first sent a
question whose answer only an outsider would know to verify the other
party's identity.

After a moment, Bernadette responded: "The Sonia Sea, the Fog Sea, do I
need to continue?"

"Congratulations, you're got it correct!" Only then did Franca briefly
mention last night's events and the possible role played by the mirrored
Emperor Roselle, as well as the reasons they had speculated.

After some time, Bernadette replied: "I'd like to discuss this matter in
detail. Let's meet at 2 pm at the book warehouse at 15 Jinhua Street."
