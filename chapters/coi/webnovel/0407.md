## Chapter 407: Reward for Good Luck

After the surgery, the blind sheep stepped off the treatment table, calm
and docile, no longer resisting. The duty doctor felt like he was in a
dream.

*The operation was a success...*

*The surgical technique designed for humans had actually worked on a
sheep...*

The doctor watched in a daze as the arsonist devil guided the blind
sheep---now cured of its mental illness---out of the room and
disappeared into the crimson moonlit night.

Wherever they went, crimson flames ignited the white bandages and barely
visible fur.

In the blazing flames, black fire flowed like a river, "cleansing" away
the remaining icicles, footprints, and any other traces.

The doctor felt no immediate danger and watched in a daze, as if
enjoying a spectacular fireworks show.

After an unknown amount of time, all the flames subsided. The guard who
had been dispatched returned to the Delta Asylum with a group of
black-uniformed police officers.

"Why did it take you so long?" the doctor blurted out instinctively.

The leading officer cursed angrily, "Son of a bitch, we were ambushed in
the shadows on the way here. Someone was shooting at us from the
darkness!"

___

In Apartment 601, 3 Rue des Blouses Blanches, in the market district.

After securing I Know Someone to one of the dining table's sturdy legs,
Lumian paid the sheep no mind. He lay on the sofa in the living room and
pretended to be asleep.

His appearance had been altered back by Lie, and the Decency brooch had
long been taken off.

Franca glanced at the sheep, which stood silently and didn't attempt to
escape with the dining table, and asked, "Aren't we going to interrogate
him now?"

She avoided looking at Lumian because he had become so irritating that
she felt like punching him. Even the sheep, now a pacifist, was eager to
do the same.

Lumian's voice remained calm as he replied, "I'll question him once I've
regained my spirituality."

*That makes sense. It's safer this way. After all, I Know Someone is now
a sheep with his frontal lobe removed. He can't use his abilities or put
up resistance...* Franca, dressed in an Assassin suit, averted
her gaze and headed to her bedroom to avoid losing control of her hands,
black flames, frost, or spider silk.

She wasn't worried that any accidents might occur prior to the
interrogation, leading to I Know Someone's bizarre death or him turning
into a monster due to losing control. Madam Magician and the Major
Arcana card holder had already confirmed I Know Someone's identity. They
must have seized the opportunity to obtain the most important
information.

Jenna, holding the broken obsidian arrow, approached the divan with a
warped expression.

"Your trophy."

She offered the obsidian arrow to Lumian, who hadn't yet closed his
eyes.

During this exchange, her right hand trembled slightly, as if she wanted
to thrust the arrow into the other party's eye.

Lumian didn't take it and calmly said, "This is your reward for your
good luck.

"Or rather, this is your true stroke of luck."

*Why does he sound like a circus fortune-teller...* Jenna didn't
refuse. After mumbling to herself, she quickly turned around and entered
Franca's bedroom.

It had to be said that after her companion advanced to Demoness of
Pleasure, even as a woman, she would blush and feel her ears heat up
when she saw her change her clothes.

After changing into comfortable home clothes, Franca used Magic Mirror
Divination to get a rough understanding of the name, abilities, and
negative effects of the obsidian arrow.

"Name: Arrow of the Bloodthirsty.

"Ability: Plunge it into the chest where the heart and let it absorb
blood. The user will gain potent self-healing and regeneration
abilities, along with exceptional physical attributes. Whether it's
speed, agility, the ability to communicate with animals, vision, smell,
or hearing, they will all be greatly enhanced. Their charisma will also
receive a significant boost.

"In addition, the user will gain Dark domain spell-like abilities such
as Abyss Shackles, Claw of Corrosion, and Wings of Darkness.

"Negative effects:

"While in use, you will despise sunlight and crave blood.

"Your blood will be continuously drained by the item until you succumb
to excessive blood loss. You must constantly monitor your condition and
remove the broken arrow in time.

"The more you use it, the more likely it is to cause subtle changes in
your body. If these accumulate beyond a limit, it might even lead to
bodily collapse. Note: Try not to use it for more than three minutes at
a time. It's best to use it with intervals of more than three days. This
way, your body will have a chance to recover and prevent any mutations.

"Avoid using it during a full moon. While it can enhance your condition,
it can also easily lead to illusions and danger."

"Not a bad mystical item," Franca praised sincerely as she handed the
Arrow of the Bloodthirsty back to Jenna. "Carrying it doesn't have any
negative effects. Such a mystical item could fetch over 40,000 verl d'or
at various mysticism gatherings."

Holding the Arrow of the Bloodthirsty, Jenna pondered and said, "If I
give it to you, will that settle the debt I owe you?"

She believed she owed Franca 30,000 verl d'or.

Franca chuckled.

"Don't worry. This Arrow of the Bloodthirsty can significantly boost
your strength, providing you with true self-preservation abilities. You
can sell it later once your Sequence has advanced to the point where
it's no longer useful.

"Take your time paying back the money you owe me. There's no rush."

Jenna fell silent for a few moments before nodding in agreement.

Lumian slept until 6 a.m., feeling refreshed but still with a slight
throbbing in his head.

As he sat up and looked around, he noticed that the sheep I Know Someone
had transformed into was standing quietly by the dining table, its empty
eye sockets filled with dried blood.

Lumian chuckled.

"Your resilience is impressive. Such severe injuries and basic treatment
didn't do you in."

He led the sheep into the living room and poured the remaining truth
serum into its mouth.

With that task completed, Lumian recited an incantation in Hermes.

"His Grace."

A dark light flashed, and the grayish-white sheepskin split open,
revealing I Know Someone's body in a blue-and-white-striped hospital
gown.

Lumian guided him to a chair and had him sit down. Staring into his
empty blood-red eye sockets, he smiled and sighed.

"As I mentioned yesterday, we can finally have a good chat."

The calm I Know Someone remained silent.

Lumian retreated to the sofa and sat down. He patiently waited for the
truth serum to take effect before asking, "What's your name, what was
your original occupation, and why were you in the Delta Asylum?"

He began with the simplest questions, using the truth serum to guide the
other's instinctive responses.

I Know Someone's voice was unremarkable, yet strangely compelling.

"My name is Pierre Theuriau. I was originally one of the deputy editors
of Basic Medicine.

"I once mentioned that I know someone who ended up in an asylum due to
negligence and overconfidence. Well, that someone was me. I was obsessed
with manipulating the minds of others and didn't pay enough attention to
my own issues. One day, I just lost my mind.

"When I finally regained consciousness, I found myself in the Delta
Asylum. Fortunately, I was only mentally unstable and didn't completely
lose control. I still had some sense of self-preservation and didn't
unleash my Beyonder powers recklessly. If I had, they would have sent me
to the Inquisition."

*The person you mentioned is indeed yourself...* After
discovering that "I Know Someone" was hiding in the asylum, Lumian
gained a new understanding of what he had said back then.

He pressed further, "Now that you've regained your consciousness and the
ability to think, why do you choose to remain in the Delta Asylum?"

I Know Someone didn't show any mockery or amusement. He answered calmly,
"I find the asylum fascinating. The thought patterns, mental states, and
mental constructs of the patients here are significantly different from
those of ordinary people. They deserve observation, research, and
analysis.

"Moreover, some of them have gone mad due to illness, while others have
become mentally unstable due to other factors. The latter group includes
individuals who have come into contact with the mysterious and
abnormal."

"Including the one that posed as you?" Lumian asked, seeking
confirmation.

I Know Someone nodded slowly.

"Yes, he's quite special. I've been observing him for a long time. He's
like a philosopher, constantly posing unusual questions. Patients close
to him, nurses who care for him, and even doctors who treat him have
gradually shifted toward his mental state. There were also guardians
with hidden supernatural abilities lurking around him.

"We dealt with the guardians and worked to gain his trust. Everything
went smoothly. We learned that they are part of an organization called
the Entry Persons and practice a secretive ritual known as Midoro's
Worship. It allows one's Astral Projection to ascend to various heavenly
domains and witness extraordinary phenomena. They can touch the fringes
of immortality and gain knowledge and corresponding abilities, enabling
them to undergo a fundamental transformation behind the formless door."

*Entry Persons... Formless door...* Lumian memorized the
information and continued asking,

"After Loki's resurrection and his given warning, why didn't you
immediately flee Trier?"

I Know Someone's response lacked any emotion as he said, "How lame would
that be? We'd have to eliminate a few pursuers before making our
escape."

*So that's the reason...* Lumian thought there must be something
significant that had kept I Know Someone in Trier.

"Then why didn't you go into hiding somewhere else?"

I Know Someone replied calmly,"I want to witness the despair and
suffering of those chasing me."

*Using my life for amusement...* Lumian couldn't help but
chuckle.

"Do you not realize the strength of the Tarot Club?"

I Know Someone pondered for a moment and then said, "The secret
organization that uses tarot cards as their code names? What do they
have to do with you?"

Upon hearing this, Lumian burst into laughter as he bent over, his
amusement clearly exaggerated.
