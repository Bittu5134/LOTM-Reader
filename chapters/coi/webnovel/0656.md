## Chapter 656: Choosing a Reward

Lumian once again encountered Monsieur Iveljsta, who resided in B18. He
still wore a fluffy black hat adorned with a white feather and a complex
black robe.

With a quick glance, Lumian had already covertly used Weakness
Investigation to search for pale-white marks on Iveljsta's body, ready
for potential assassinations and surprise attacks.

Aurore and Emperor Roselle had always emphasized the need to stay
vigilant against others at all times!

Of course, Lumian felt that the two of them hadn't done a good job in
this matter. Otherwise, they would still be active in the world.

At that moment, the pallor on Iveljsta's body concentrated on his
dark-brown eyes, emitting an illusory quality that seemed unreal.

*Does this mean he can quickly transform into a Wraith, and his eyes are
no longer his weakness?* As Lumian pondered, he gestured towards
the divan in the living room.

"Let's chat there."

Ludwig, seated at the dining table, glanced at Iveljsta for a few
seconds before lowering his head and continuing his meal with a
succulent piece of beef.

Iveljsta nodded slightly and entered the living room quietly, taking a
seat in a corner of the divan.

*Are you a student at a primary school? So disciplined...*
Lumian criticized as he focused on observing Iverista's luck.

It was relatively normal and nothing special.

At that moment, Lumian suddenly had a few thoughts.

*Luck Observation and Weakness Investigation require the eyes to
determine the target's color. However, one focuses on the background
color, while the other captures the various colors on the surface of the
body. When I become a Fate Appropriator, could these two abilities fuse
and mutate into a more special ability?*

*Why can I only use my eyes to observe these two abilities? Is a blind
Reaper incapable of attacking a target's weakness? Similarly, is a blind
Ascetic unqualified to observe others' luck? Can't they rely on their
spirituality and ears and nose?*

*Or could it be done at a higher Sequence?*

Lumian eased into the armchair, positioning himself at an angle across
from Iveljsta. Flashing a friendly smile, he asked, "What's the matter?"

He spoke in Intisian.

Iveljsta, as silent as a corpse, straightened up. His eyes, deep as he
spoke in ancient Feysac.

"Allow me to introduce myself. Iveljsta Eggers, a member of the Rose
School of Thought and temperance faction under the Church of The Fool."

Lumian's nerves, already tense, heightened. Nevertheless, he maintained
a relaxed demeanor, confirming, "Are you Twanaku's liaison?"

He switched to ancient Feysac.

"No," Iveljsta shook his head, "I've already eliminated that member
fifteen minutes ago."

*Fifteen minutes ago, when I was still with the patrol team... However,
you can't expect me to believe you just because you say so...*
Lumian feigned curiosity and asked, "I recall that you arrived in Port
Pylos before Twanaku was exposed. What was your original motive?"

"I'm investigating the primitive forest in this area. I'm still in the
early stages of gathering more information," Iveljsta replied seriously.
"Four days ago, I came into contact with Twanaku and obtained some
information from him. He seemed fine and was very restrained."

*He's indeed restrained. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a second serial
murder case in Port Pylos only after four years... Going to the
primitive forest to investigate... The primitive forest... On the
surface, the incident in Tizamo Town was a sudden attack by a tribe in
the primitive forest. *Lumian quickly made many connections and
said to Iveljsta thoughtfully, "Twanaku once did something in Tizamo
Town that involved the tribes in the nearby primitive forest. Some of
his important items seem to be hidden in Tizamo Town. It might also be
related to a Nois family Demon of unknown Sequence."

Iveljsta listened in silence, lost in thought.

After a few seconds, he said to Lumian, "Thank you for providing this
information. It might not be useful for my investigation, but it can let
me know what to be wary of."

He didn't specify his mission. Clearly, he needed his superior's
permission.

Lumian responded nonchalantly, "Even if I don't tell you now, you'll
find out tonight or tomorrow."

Having already reported the matter to Madam Magician, the Major Arcana
card holder would undoubtedly inform the Church of The Fool and the
temperance faction in detail subsequently. It wouldn't only be a general
outline that mentioned key personnel like before.

Iveljsta nodded with restraint and said, "I'm here to express my
gratitude and to inform you that we're already investigating any
potential problems and latent dangers.

"Also, if you need help in Matani, feel free to come to me."

"Alright." Lumian didn't stand on ceremony.

After delving into the more serious matters, Lumian, intrigued, asked
Iveljsta, "Why did you add the Rose School of Thought prefix when you
introduced yourself? You've already left the Rose School of Thought and
joined the Church of The Fool. It sounds as if the Rose School of
Thought is affiliated with the Church of The Fool."

"Our leader specifically requested this. She always believes that we are
the true orthodox branch of the Rose School of Thought. Only we
represent the Rose School of Thought. Those traitors should change the
organization's name, not us," Iveljsta explained in detail.

*Sounds quite stubborn... Aren't you from the temperance faction? Don't
you restrain your emotions and desires in this aspect? Yes, Sequence 5
is Wraith, close to evil spirits, and evil spirits have an extreme side.
Is this reflected in High-Sequence Beyonders of the temperance faction's
corresponding pathway?* Lumian didn't quite understand and tried
to make a guess based on the available information.

He was just chatting and had no intention of inquiring further. Instead,
he asked,

"Your last name is Eggers. Was your ancestor a member of the Balam
Empire's royal family?"

"Yes," Iveljsta replied proudly, his emotions held in check. "And my
mother's lineage is noble from the Highlands Kingdom."

For many in the Southern Continent, the surname Eggers bore unparalleled
prestige. It was a symbol of a deity who had once trod the land, a
representation of Death's dominion over the world.

But Lumian's curiosity wandered elsewhere.

"I've heard that the mausoleums of the Balam Empire's nobles are
constructed upside down underground, much like this hotel. What mystical
significance does that hold? Is it simply a way to confront death? And
why is death associated with the underground? Shouldn't the Underworld
exist in the spirit world?"

This was the question that piqued Lumian's interest upon learning about
the matter.

His understanding of mysticism was limited.

Iveljsta pondered for a moment and then explained, "I didn't choose the
Death pathway. The construction method originated from ancient times,
passed down by all the Eggers ancestors, devoted to the deity who
controlled death.

"He embodies the very concept of death. Emulating Him is a way to
approach the source of death.

"This mystic explanation resonates with me the most. Over the years,
I've heard various interpretations:

"Some see life and death as opposing mystical concepts. They argue that,
just as we stand upright and grow upwards in life, burial upside down
signifies the contradiction and connection between life and death.

"Others believe that true hell isn't in the spirit world or the
Underworld, but deep underground. Descending further symbolizes reaching
true hell and returning to the essence of death. Thus, mausoleums are
built upside down, reflecting our intention to face hell, worship death,
and return to the source. This is the essence and symbol of mysticism."

*Some Beyonders of the Death pathway don't really approve of the
Underworld... Can you discover true hell by delving deep underground?
Heh heh, hasn't anyone informed you that the world we're on is
essentially a planet? Does this extension reach underground magma and
the core? Do they believe that's the genuine hell? Going deeper will
traverse the core and the magma, but that'll merely be the other side of
the planet, let alone true hell...* Lumian found himself
increasingly entertained as he listened.

Suddenly, he was taken aback.

*What exists on the opposite side of the planet?*

*I only know of the Northern and Southern Continents. Considering the
time difference, they're nearly on the same side...*

*If this world is genuinely a planet, there must be another side. But
I've never heard of any continents---just an expansive sea?*

*Wait, how did those giant fellows from the New City of Silver emerge
from the Forsaken Land of the Gods... Something must have occurred on
the continent on the other side of the planet, abandoned by the deities.
Could that be why it's known as the Forsaken Land of the Gods?*

*If I have a chance in the future, I could revisit the New City of
Silver and explore the library for books related to the Forsaken Land of
the Gods...*

Lumian reined in his thoughts and continued conversing with Iveljsta for
a while. Eventually, he escorted the former descendant of the Balam
Empire's royal family, a member of the temperance faction, away from
this floor.

Not long after returning to his room, the doll messenger arrived with a
response from Madam Magician.

"The information and insights you've gathered this time are
exceptionally valuable. It's no wonder my spiritual perception guided me
to let you visit the New City of Silver after the Hanth Island Demon
incident.

"Reflecting on it, your encounter with Naboredisley seemed almost
coincidental. You followed the clues to Hanth Island. Hmm, you should
grasp the significance, right?

"The situation in this matter both reassures me and intensifies my
vigilance and anxiety. When that entity stands by our side, these
details are incredibly useful. However, He won't always be with us. When
our objectives clash, I can't fathom what challenges we'll face. The
same goes for you and me.

"Therefore, Hunters must rely more on their personal growth amidst
blood, fire, chaos, and conflict. Many Hunters meet their end, using
their bones to forge the Red Priest who conquers all.

"We've already initiated an internal review. It involves a considerable
number of individuals and will take a substantial amount of time to
complete. Considering your contributions, besides converting the
Beyonder characteristic into a Sealed Artifact, you have the option to
choose a reward. Pick one out of two. Here are your choices.

"1: the potion formula for the Hunter pathway's Sequence 4 Iron-blooded
Knight. 2: I'll assist you in divining clues about the remaining parts
of the Abscessed Hand's body."
