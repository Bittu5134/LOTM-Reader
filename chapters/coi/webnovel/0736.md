## Chapter 736: Night

*Can you accept such an outcome?*

Inside an empty house in Quartier de la Cathédrale Commémorative,
Angoulême de François, wearing a lion headdress, stood by the window,
gazing down at the gas streetlamps below, patiently waiting.

After losing contact, he and Hidden Blade had switched emergency
communication methods. They aimed to quickly re-establish contact, even
without Madame Hela's messenger.

Early the previous morning, as soon as he had wrapped up the Moran
Avigny case, he immediately tried to locate Hidden Blade.

Finally, Hidden Blade Franca, dressed in her assassin outfit, emerged
from the shadows.

Angoulême cut right to it and asked, "Did you take down Moran Avigny?"

"Otherwise?" Franca replied with a smile.

Although Overseer Perle's vortex warning hung over Franca's head like a
sharp blade, preventing her from relaxing just because Moran Avigny was
dead and she had the intel, Franca wouldn't let it ruin her mood or make
her solemn or anxious.

The Major Arcana card holders would naturally worry about something so
serious, and she and the others just needed to follow orders and
complete the missions. No point fretting.

Plus, the intel they obtained was crucial and valuable. Either the
Eternal Blazing Sun Church or the Demoness Sect would definitely be
grateful!

Franca was filled with anticipation over this.

"It really was you guys..." Angoulême couldn't help but sigh.

Hidden Blade and her team really acted fast. They had mentioned dealing
with a government minister, and not long after, they actually attacked
and succeeded.

Franca covered for Lumian, saying, "We were waiting for Moran Avigny to
walk into the mirror himself. Surprisingly, the Aurora Order suddenly
assassinated him, forcing him into our trap early."

Combined with the scene details, Angoulême slightly nodded and said, "So
it was just a coincidence..."

This aligned with what the Purifiers had confirmed.

Angoulême then asked, "So where's Moran Avigny now?"

"Dead," Franca said with a tongue click. "He was definitely a Mirror
Person, and gave us lots of important intel."

"What intel?" Angoulême quickly asked.

Franca chuckled and raised her right hand, gently rubbing her thumb and
index finger together. "Where's my informant fee?"

Angoulême said in exasperated amusement, "Don't forget I contributed a
lot to the Moran Avigny operation. Even if I don't get spoils, it's no
problem to hear the intel, right?"

Franca, who always prided herself on fairly "splitting loot," awkwardly
cleared her throat.

"Just kidding. Just kidding. But that intel is super important. Your
superior will definitely reward you. Don't forget to help me collect my
fee!"

"Get to the point," Angoulême replied in a deep voice.

It wasn't that he was stingy about the fee, but Hidden Blade had twice
emphasized how crucial the intel was, making him eager.

Franca omitted Tarot Club and Aurora Order details, but started from
capturing Jebus to Overseer Perle's painted self appearing and Lumian's
theory about the whole situation.

Initially, Angoulême stayed relatively composed. Mirror People problems
barely factored into Purifier expectations. But when Moran Avigny was
tricked into revealing Roselle Gustav led the Mirror People, Angoulême's
head started buzzing louder and louder.

*Why do Hidden Blade and the others always get mixed up in such major
situations?*

*How long has it been since the Hostel incident? Why is there another
"vortex"?*

After Franca finished, Angoulême couldn't help but raise his right hand
and pinch his throbbing, headdress-concealed forehead. His emotions were
so scrambled he was speechless.

Franca smugly asked, "How's that? Project Vortex, the Mirror People, and
intel about a hidden traitor---pretty important stuff, right?"

Noticing Angoulême's grave gaze and slightly moving, teeth-grinding
mouth, Franca instinctively added, "Don't blame me! We're not causing
these problems, Trier's just uniquely prone to all kinds of chaos. We're
victims too!"

Angoulême slowly exhaled and said, "I'll... submit this intel...
tonight. I won't forget to pass along my informant's reward request.
What do you want?"

At the mention of "tonight," Angoulême's emotions surged and he paused a
moment.

He had just finished his workday an hour ago and left Saint Viève
Cathedral. Now he had to return!

*I'm Agent 007, not some societal slave working from midnight to
midnight every damn day!* Angoulême inwardly cursed, but still
appeared calm, reliable, and emotionally stable.

Franca deeply pondered and said, "All the Pleasure potion ingredients."

She had considered her Affliction potion could be rewarded by the
Demoness Sect, but not Jenna's. She could only rely on the authorities.

"Aren't you already at Pleasure?" Angoulême muttered, giving up asking.
He nodded, "I'll help get it."

He didn't ask about Hidden Blade's Pleasure potion preparations, just as
he didn't ask how she and her crew survived facing a demigod's painted
self.

Franca was overjoyed at 007's promise.

*Getting Pleasure from the Church and Affliction from the Demoness Sect,
surely Madam Judgment would reward me too. I sold this one intel three
times... I can now understand Lumian's glee at triple-dipping mission
rewards!*

Angoulême rubbed his temples and muttered, "There are Cardinals not from
the Sun pathway, and way more diocese bishops. I really don't know what
we'll uncover next. I just hope the impact isn't too massive."

He meant the April Fool's insider in the Eternal Church. With a clear
lead, it wouldn't be hard for that party to be discovered, even if they
worked through a Broker.

Without waiting for Franca's reply, Angoulême pondered a moment and
said, "The humanoid Sealed Artifact transaction is approved. Let me know
the transaction details anytime."

"It's finally approved..." Franca criticized the bureaucracy and
curiously asked, "What's the story with that humanoid Artifact?"

She had encountered the humanoid Sealed Artifact during the sea prayer
ritual and knew its abnormal power.

Angoulême shook his head. "I'm not cleared for that intel. All I know is
she used to be a Sequence 4 Spectator demigod. Later she suddenly went
insane, but I don't know if she went mad before an evil god corrupted
her, or because of the corruption."

"It was probably the latter," Franca said thoughtfully. "Aren't
Spectator Beyonders usually emotionally stable and hard to lose
control?"

Angoulême rejected Franca's statement. "From what I know, Spectators
normally don't have issues. But when they do, it gets really messy."

"True," Franca thought of I Know Someone.

After chatting a while, Angoulême bid Hidden Blade farewell and left the
empty room.

Before leaving, he quickly reviewed the intel, then inwardly sighed with
a heavy heart.

*Aren't there way too many mystical incidents in Trier?*

___

In the market district, Jenna seized a chance to act as a Witch again.

Wearing a black cloak and dark dress, she walked the shadowed street,
pondering new acting directions as she looked for an opportunity.

*I can't just equate Witches with bad deeds. Sinister, dark acts aren't
necessarily bad...*

*Among the Witch legends I've gathered so far, many focused on Witches
using mystical and sinister dark powers to help others fulfill desires,
tempting them to stumble...*

*These legends likely contain remnants of acts by Demonesses posing as
Witches. I could try imitating them. Plus, tempting others into
depravity is a deeper way for an Instigator. Pleasure's acting also
corrupts the target...*

*Yes, the mystical powers of sinisterness and darkness, tempting
depravity and depravity brings calamity...*

Jenna's thoughts gradually became more clear.

With these in mind, she turned onto Rue Anarchie, intending to find a
chance to act as a Witch on this chaotic street.

After a few steps, Jenna suddenly heard someone singing hysterically,
"Trier, a city dressed in gold,

"A ball that endures 'til dawn unfolds;

"Chicken roasted, dripping with oil's grace,

"A castle cake to fill each eager embrace.

"A bow-tied attendant glides 'mongst the guests,

"Merrily dancing with joy and delight.

"My beloved, hidden 'midst the crowd,

"Among them, my love resides,

"In the Capital of Joy, forever Trier!"

*This voice... *Jenna peered from the shadows at Auberge du Coq
Doré and saw Lumian, in a thick brown jacket, sitting on the third floor
windowsill, holding a green liquid-filled bottle.

*Hadn't he gone to the Aurora Order and never returned?* Jenna
frowned and stepped out of the shadow.

Lumian noticed her and smiled. He leaped down from the third floor,
landing steadily before her.

"Why are you here?" Jenna asked with concern.

Lumian smiled casually. "I suddenly missed this place. Came back for a
drink."

Sensing Lumian's strange excitement, Jenna pondered a moment then asked,
"Did something happen?"

"No," Lumian denied quickly. He emphasized, "I'm fine."

With an absinthe bottle in hand, he headed towards Rue Anarchie's exit.
Jenna trailed closely behind, not inquiring further.

Under the crimson moonlight and scattered gas lamps, the silent Lumian
suddenly smiled and announced, "I'm about to start blaspheming. No, it's
already begun."

He didn't turn around and kept walking.

"Haven't you been blaspheming all this while?" Jenna cautiously probed
with Lumian's usual self-deprecation.

Lumian's gaze stayed fixed ahead as he smiled. "It's different this
time."

He quickened his pace and didn't mention it again.

Jenna glanced at Lumian's muddy leather boots and the dirty but dry
surroundings. She pursed her lips and didn't press further.

Lumian continued walking, occasionally humming a tune, occasionally
chatting with Jenna and joking with a smile.

He made his way back to his rented apartment and entered his room.

Jenna stood quietly in the living room, watching Lumian close the
bedroom's wooden door.

In the dark room, lit only by crimson moonlight, Lumian sat at his desk,
unfolded a piece of paper, and picked up a fountain pen.

He didn't light the gas wall lamp, nor create a blazing fireball. In the
pitch-black, he positioned the pen under the faint light.

Amidst paper rustling, Lumian's smile faded, and his wrist slowed.

Finally, he penned the unusually brief letter: "Honorable Madam
Magician, I'd like to meet you."
