# Afterword {epub:type=appendix}

When I opened the document to write this afterword, countless thoughts
flooded my mind. I didn't even know where to start. After letting it
settle for a while, I realized what I most wanted to say: I will never
write a sequel again!

This has nothing to do with anything else it's purely because the
writing difficulty was overwhelming, nearly surpassing my mental limits.

The first challenge involved the already expansive and well-defined
world-building. There wasn't much room to create suspense or secret
reveals, nor was there a crucial hook to drive plot tension. In Lord of
Mysteries, the early parts involving the loss of control of low-
sequence Beyonders were thrilling and engaging. But in Circle of
Inevitability, unless the plot involved Outer Deities, major crises, or
historical events from past epochs, it was hard to excite readers. Small
issues could only be portrayed as facets of larger events, but how many
major events could there be, especially ones that the protagonist had
the capacity to be involved in?

I anticipated this problem before starting the book. My planned
solutions involved unraveling the Fourth Epoch Tudor Dynasty's
mysteries, the infiltration by Outer Deities, and weaving standalone
events into a larger narrative. I also tried to use "arrangements" and
"coincidences" to enable Lumian to participate and tie events together.
But constant manipulation led to a loss of satisfying moments and
weakened immersion.

The second challenge involved the already-established world and
factions. The major players and motivations were clear, so planning an
event required considering exponentially more participants. In Lord of
Mysteries Vol. 2, the Great Smog involved mainly the royal family, the
Aurora Order, the Demoness Sect, and the three major Churches. The
latter could be treated as a whole, with me singling out one sufficient.

But by Vol. 3 of Circle of Inevitability, the Hostel incident involved
seven or eight Outer Deity organizations. Even focusing on the Pixies,
General Philip, and the Nightstalkers meant dealing with three factions.
On top of that, the Eternal Blazing Sun Church had to participate, the
God of Steam and Machinery Church had its own problems, and the
Knowledge Moor was involved. That's not all. With the Conqueror's
Beyonder characteristic involved, the Medici, Sauron, and Einhorn
families were necessary. Likewise for the Iron and Blood Cross Order.
The Tarot Club would get involved too. The Mirror People wouldn't have
missed this opportunity. All of this was two or three times the previous
scale. All required prior foreshadowing and proper introductions,
drastically increasing the writing difficulty.

The scariest part? In Lord of Mysteries, these problems only emerged in
the latter half of Vol. 6. In Circle of Inevitability, it started as
early as Vol. 3. Every major event felt like writing the final two
volumes of Lord of Mysteries-constantly juggling everything. I nearly
tore my hair out. Thankfully, I have thick hair thanks to my genes, or
I'd be worried about going bald.

The third challenge was that carrying over so many characters from Lord
of Mysteries meant needing over twenty characters to appear and shine in
key events. Yet the spotlight in any single event is limited. Everyone
wants their moment, but it's impossible to satisfy all. Many readers
criticized Lumian for having too few standout moments. I didn't want
that either... but the first challenge forced the plot into major events
involving high-level characters. Naturally, the spotlight shifted to
them. That's why, at the end of Vol. 3, the most memorable figures were
Medici and the Eternal Blazing Sun. At the end of Vol. 5, it was Amon,
Roselle, and Adam.

I can only say that to keep things logical, I sacrificed a lot of cool
moments, leaving the protagonist with less time in the spotlight. So,
back to what I said: I will never write a sequel again!

I once discussed this problem with a few author friends-in the same
scene and event, how many characters can be effectively portrayed? Most
agreed: around four. Same for me. Six is the extreme limit given special
conditions. Beyond that, some characters inevitably become marginalized.
That's why, in Lord of Mysteries, Tarot Club gatherings only focused on
two or three members at a time.

But Circle of Inevitability inherited a massive cast from the start. I
had to introduce new characters and still give space to essential
factions.

Maybe a more gifted author could handle more characters in a scene and
event, but that's not me-not now.

Vol. 1 and 2 were manageable, set in more confined environments with
fewer legacy characters. But it only got scarier and scarier
afterward...

Sometimes, choices had to be made.

So, I deeply regret that most members of the Tarot Club didn't appear
much in the first five volumes. Firstly, compared to Lumian at the time,
their level was far too high, and there were too few high-level,
specialized events suitable for him. If they had been casually involved
in minor roles, it might have felt even more off. But if I handled it as
an ensemble cast, key events were limited and either had to be part of
the main plot or couldn't be revealed too early. As a result, most of
what needed to be handled were small daily crises, which couldn't
generate enough narrative tension. Secondly, from a logical standpoint,
it wasn't suitable for many events' highlights to be given to them. Even
when they did appear, their impact was limited---just like in the Vortex
incident, which drew criticism.

This is an inherent issue with sequels, and also due to my limited
writing ability. I'm truly sorry I couldn't do better.

Some readers said the protagonist shouldn't have interacted with the
Tarot Club from the start. But if the Tarot Club hadn't noticed such
events, and they didn't pay attention to people with special fates,
others would've complained that the Tarot Club was useless for
overlooking it.

Moreover, juggling too many characters beyond my capacity was one issue.
Another was that after Lord of Mysteries, many characters had their fans
and detractors. No matter which character I focused on, showing them too
little would spark complaints, and too much would bring accusations of
favoritism. Giving them standout moments drew criticism and nitpicking,
while lacking such moments dissatisfied others. I could only do my best
to write from a logical standpoint.

Take Adam's death at the end, for instance. Some readers complained it
lacked impact and was too abrupt. But Adam had already received plenty
of highlights earlier. By the end, from a logical standpoint, Adam being
able to withstand the first wave of attacks and allow the protected
zones be teleported, while resisting Primordial Hunger was already
pretty impressive.

Others questioned why Klein didn't help Adam recover after accommodating
with Sefirah Castle for a whole month. But think about it-helping Adam
fight God Almighty would have exposed Klein's awakening to the
Primordial God Almighty, which would alert the Mother Goddess of
Depravity, and then all the Outer Deities. How could they secretly
prepare after that?

More importantly, Klein couldn't help. Adam could interfere with Klein's
dreams only before the real confrontation and fusion began. This time,
the battle and fusion started immediately for Him to counter the first
wave of the Mother Goddess of Depravity's descent. Honestly, of all the
characters in the first book, Adam received the most development in
Circle of Inevitability. Klein mainly carried over past roles and
explored potential changes, while I personally feel I fully portrayed
Adam's complexity-a cold, calculating god that has His detractors and
admirers who also loves humanity.

I understand and even feel glad that some readers liked Adam-it shows I
succeeded in writing Him. But if someone hates Lumian and dislikes or
resents Adam, all I can offer is a line of poetry: "Better to die of
hunger quietly than fight in vain like a mantis." I hope they never face
sacrifice forced upon them.

Many argued that Adam's death lacked grandeur and wrote up theses on why
it was unreasonable, but I couldn't comprehend their logic. Throughout
the Circle of Inevitability writing process, I encountered many similar
criticisms: dissatisfaction with some character's development, leading
to long explanations about prior plot issues. But when probed deeper, it
boiled down to circular reasoning. My only choice was to ignore it. Some
critiques came from heartfelt engagement, while others were purely
malicious.

For example, during the Circle of Inevitability's redemption arc, people
joked about the protagonist ending the world while the antagonist saved
it. It was nice, with everyone knowing that it was just a joke. But some
claimed the main character trio created such a plan, only to mess
everything up, so that they could only foolishly watch the villain save
the world.

If you ask, "Who brought the Circle of Inevitability to that side of the
battlefield?"

The response would be, "Don't ask."

If you add, "Wasn't it Klein's ability as Beacon of Destiny, guided by
Genie's hint, that led Circle of Inevitability there?"

The reply would be, "Don't say."

Basically, anything inconvenient to the nitpicking is dismissed. They
have to lower their intelligence, becoming idiots before sharing their
twisted interpretations to proselytize others into believing they were
some smartass.

Similarly, there's also the saying, "Noble humanity destroys the world,
inferior godhood saves it." Even without arguing about the truth behind
the world's destruction and salvation, one could simply ask, "Then why
was noble humanity forced to the point of the world being destroyed?"

Another example is when I wrote about Franca saving the streetwalkers. I
had already added narrative armor in advance, stating that Trier had too
many restrictions and that she would aim to build a new society when the
opportunity and ability arose. Yet, a group of moral purists still
criticized it. I usually don't pay attention to those comments, but some
even brought it into writers' groups, suggesting things like, "Why not
build a factory and have the streetwalkers work there? Such fake
kindness." Sure, if the streetwalkers in the market district were sent
to work in a factory and gangs were banned from this business, the world
would be at peace, right?

But in reality, the demand wouldn't decrease, the law wouldn't crack
down on it, and if the market district didn't have it, it would just
move to another district. With the number of streetwalkers significantly
reduced, gangs from other districts would force good people into
prostitution, engage in human trafficking, and coercion. So, would those
who suffer from this scheme not be considered people? Without
overthrowing the old system and challenging the Church and government,
this problem can't be completely solved-only gradual reforms can be
made.

There's too much of this kind of misinterpretation and disregard for
prior context. Should I really care and slow down my pacing because of
it? Is it necessary? I've always ignored it. If people hadn't constantly
shared these distortions in writers' groups, I wouldn't have known how
far it had been twisted. If someone believed those summaries and then
read the full text, they'd realize it was an entirely different story.

So, I must apologize. I once said, "If readers don't understand the
plot, it's the author's fault." I was wrong. I spoke too arrogantly. I'm
neither a sage nor a god. I can't make everyone understand. Some
plotlines are misunderstood due to readers' personal reading habits,
some because they're casually reading and don't want to think deeply,
some because they skip around, and some intentionally misunderstand. I
can't solve all of these. I was too conceited before. I deserved the
backlash.

I'll leave it at that. To sum up, Circle of Inevitability was burdened
with too many constraints from the start. The writing difficulty was so
high that I often lost control, though I occasionally managed to pull it
back. It was mentally exhausting, a daily struggle. This is also why I
cut some side plots from Volumes 7 and 8-I couldn't manage them anymore.
Expanding further would have risked collapsing the entire story.

Overall, my self-assessment is that Circle of Inevitability has both
well-written parts and parts that fall short. For example, the ending of
Volume 6 still has me thinking about how to build the climax of the
confrontation with the Celestial Worthy without introducing too much
about the Western Continent too early. My current solution would be to
save Arrodes and the issue of the mirrored Original Creator for the
final climax, delivering twists and turns just when readers expect the
story to end.

In short-never writing a sequel again. It's just too difficult.

Some characters' endings weren't explicitly written out but were hinted
at. Explaining them in detail would've entangled too many threads,
disrupting the tone of the final chapters or undermining the sense that
catastrophes never truly end but come again and again-that life is about
enduring disaster after disaster until death.

For example, Farbauti's ending: I deliberately mentioned that the Abyss
Uniqueness and the corresponding Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristics
weren't taken. If I elaborated, I'd need to explain how the Devils
handled it, which would be messy. The solution? Place it on Lumian's
planet, create a new Abyss, and let Beyonders who took that path and
committed crimes "ascend" to that planet after reaching mid-to-low
Sequences-to kill themselves and play among themselves.

Another example is Medici's Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristics. As a
former King of Angels, His spiritual imprint wouldn't dissipate quickly.
Since Medici didn't appear in the final dream city while Cheek and Tudor
did, it implies that the characteristics was returned after Lumian,
Aurore, and Jenna stabilized.

I didn't elaborate because explaining Lumian and the others' state would
require detailing how they began merging and confronting the malevolent
dragon through the balance provided by the Circle of Inevitability.
That's why the malevolent dragon didn't appear in the dream. Lumian,
Aurore, and Jenna had become one entity-the former representing the
masculine aspect, and the latter two the feminine.

As for whether extracting two Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristics would
break the balance, simultaneously removing the Demoness of Apocalypse
Beyonder characteristics solves it. But this had to wait until Lumian,
Aurore, and Jenna fully stabilized and began resisting and merging with
the malevolent dragon. Besides, the Beyonder characteristics and the
effects from the Beyonder characteristics wouldn't reset.

Another hint regarding Adam's ending: the sun ornament on Amon's car and
Lumian's final remark. I highlighted certain details during the war,
like only Leodero's and Herabergen's consciousness being merged in, with
no mention of others.

Anyway, it's impossible to cover everything. Touching on every
character's ending would become a tedious checklist. Leaving some
ambiguity---just knowing they've begun new lives---is enough.

Originally, I wanted a more tragic ending with greater sacrifices to
better reflect the world, but considering this was the conclusion of the
Lord of Mysteries universe, I softened it. Although everyone will die
someday, at least for now, it's a happy ending. From the battle
simulation and logical reasoning, this outcome was achievable, so there
was no need to force tragedy.

This is why the final battle unfolded the way it did. With so few
resources and manpower, achieving a decisive victory and permanently
solving problems was impossible. Through extreme preparation,
mobilization, and division of forces, forcing the enemy to retreat and
agree to a temporary truce was already incredibly difficult.

For example, if the Mother Goddess hadn't been reset, even if she didn't
join the battle and merely healed injured Outer Deities or prevented
Their sealing or banishing, the situation would have collapsed. Or, if
Klein hadn't placed the Circle of Inevitability on that battlefield to
let Amanises and Lumian face the Monarch of Decay, things might've
turned out better- or worse, considering the Monarch of Decay's
symbolism. Either way, the decision was made to aid the Celestial Master
and company quickly-the most effective solution in the shortest possible
amount of time.

Considering all this, a "temporary" truce better fits the final volume's
title and the world's tone. It may seem anticlimactic, but it's more
acceptable than a decisive victory or heavier sacrifices.

Many may dislike symbolic combat, finding it too abstract, but I think
it was fresher and more interesting than repeating past battles. It also
made the overall flow of the final war clearer and easier to follow. I
consider it an acceptable choice.

In summary, it's understandable that many readers dislike Lumian. I get
it. But it's not mainly because the character was shallow. One reason is
the lack of immersion-forced to engage in high-level events and rapidly
level up, many of the enjoyable aspects of acting were skipped. The
Hunter pathway isn't as fun to act as the Seer pathway.

Second, as the protagonist of a sequel, Lumian was naturally scrutinized
and disliked. It's similar to how I personally never liked Return of the
Condor Heroes and its main character, Yang Guo. Why should the
characters I deeply invested in be used to serve as a foil for you? A
rebellious little punk instantly falling for Yang Guo for life?
Ridiculous. Effortlessly mastering top-tier martial arts? That's a joke.
These thoughts made me only read Return of the Condor Heroes twice-the
least among Louis Cha's novels. I only started to warm up to Yang Guo
later because Louis Koo was incredibly handsome, and Carman Lee was
truly stunning.

In fact, Volume 2 was when I put the most effort into portraying
Lumian's personality and psychology in depth. Unfortunately, very few
readers could relate to that mental state. Of course, this also shows
that my writing wasn't good enough and had many flaws. Speaking of this,
I can analyze why Aurore in Volume 1 attracted so much teasing and
dislike.

Most people, myself included, naturally resist sudden intimacy and
attachment. It's like how picking your own nose feels satisfying, but
having someone else do it feels awkward and uncomfortable. Due to the
plot setup and hidden storylines, Lumian had to show deep care and
reliance on his sister from the very beginning, which gradually made
readers feel resistant and repulsive.

Normally, I should've written more about their daily lives, highlighted
Aurore's good qualities, or included more of her past deeds and how she
helped during crises. This would've helped readers connect emotionally.
But given how Volume 1 was structured, that just wasn't possible. I just
couldn't do it.

This was my mistake. I overlooked this issue during the story
development and setup, leaving an inherent flaw.

Later on, as I mentioned, with so many characters and plotlines, I was
overwhelmed and could only barely tie things up without expanding
further. I'm sorry-my ability isn't there yet. I've already discussed
other issues and takeaways in previous volume summaries, so I won't
repeat them here. After finishing the series, the two things I'm most
satisfied with are: One, the world-building and settings were fully
developed without contradictions, and the unraveling of historical
mysteries was reasonably executed. Though the latter was wild and
chaotic, it still fit the tone and was interesting. Two, The high-level
characters I wanted to flesh out were successfully developed, like Adam,
Cheek, Medici, Eternal Blazing Sun, the Mother Goddess of Depravity,
etc.

Speaking of Medici, I originally wanted to write about a battle of wits
and courage between Him and Lumian. But after completing the setup and
reaching the story's midpoint, I realized Medici couldn't make an early
move against Lumian-He's not Rosago after all. Without appearing early,
and with the special mirror world and the Cheek/Tudor problems
surfacing, there were no other options. So, it had to be this way.

Previously, I mentioned that the editor choosing the title "Circle of
Inevitability" helped me resolve a key plot point: Amon's role during
the apocalypse.

During Lord of Mysteries, when I wrote the prophecy, I only thought Amon
would head to the stars, have a fortuitous encounter, return changed,
and play a major role before and during the apocalypse. But I hadn't
fleshed out what that fortuitous encounter would be or His exact role.

When I started planning the sequel, I was stuck. How could Amon, a
Sequence 2, impact the apocalypse? At least a Sequence o is needed to be
relevant. Amon could only steal from Outer Deities, but Earth didn't
even have a Great Old One yet-what could He take? Then, the editor chose
Circle of Inevitability from a few viable titles, including High-
Dimensional Overseer. I looked at the pathway's Sequence titles: "Sinner
of the Past," "Sufferer of the Present," and "Angel of Redemption of the
Future"... It all clicked!

What's been said must come true!

Previously, when designing the Inevitability pathway, I decided it would
be key to solving the Cheek, Tudor, and mirrored Original Creator
problems. After introducing such a shocking setup, it couldn't just be
dropped. The editor choosing this title made the story flow more
naturally.

Creating a pathway's Sequence titles usually starts with thinking about
core symbolisms of the universe's operation, then designing Great Old
One names, expanding more core symbolisms, and then breaking it down to
Sequence names.

Of course, it's not always the case. Sometimes when I couldn't come up
with a good symbolism, I'd reverse the process-start with Sequence names
and work upward, gradually closing the gap.

I'll gradually reveal the remaining Outer Deity pathways' Sequence names
on my WeChat public account. Now that Circle of Inevitability is
finished, the next phase would naturally be the upcoming war and the
problems with the Great Old Ones' states-again and again, until the end.
That's the tone of the Lord of Mysteries world. Continuing would just be
repetition. That's why I said from the start this would be the final
book in the Lord of Mysteries universe. It ends here.

If I ever write about the Western Continent, it would be a long side
story. That's why the Western Continent wasn't heavily involved in
Circle of Inevitability.

The story is already planned out, but I currently lack the energy and
motivation to write it. It would center on the current Celestial Master,
depicting his growth-from rebellion and resistance to ultimately
choosing to shoulder responsibility and pain, revealing the sacrifices
made by generations in the Western Continent. But once the main plot is
written, one will realize the ending is already set. He becomes the
Demons of Knowledge, and writing his growth backward feels uninspiring.

Maybe in the future-if I feel like it. If I decide not to write it, I'll
still find time to flesh out and release the Western Continent's
setting. As for other side stories, I definitely don't have the energy
to write them anytime soon. I need a proper break.

My next book will be announced after the Chinese New Year next year. I
need time to reflect and recharge, both mentally and physically.

I currently have no clear ideas or exciting concepts for the next
project. I only have scattered scenes in mind, and those could fit into
xianxia, progressive fantasy, wuxia, urban superpowers, or even
Republic-era jianghu. I'll slowly search for inspiration.

I once really wanted to write a story about the clash between Eastern
and Western civilizations in a wuxia or xianxia setting. A protagonist
would journey along the Silk Road, passing through the Western Regions,
Transoxiana, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Northern Italy, eventually
reaching Paris. Of course, these would all be fictional nations inspired
by real ones. Along the way, the protagonist's cultivation philosophy
would continuously clash and interact with various philosophical ideas
and martial arts systems, enlightening others while broadening his own
perspective, ultimately reaching great enlightenment. This idea evolved
from the trope of a taichi master showing off in another world, but
elevated to a clash of philosophies and systematic development-with
solid reasoning.

I eventually gave up because the writing difficulty was too high. It's a
loose, travelogue-style structure involving too many civilizations and
philosophies. My current knowledge isn't enough, and I don't want to
create superficial settings and conflicts. Even after five or ten years
of preparation, it might still be too hard.

Lastly, thank you to everyone for your understanding and support. Let's
meet again in the next book.

See you in 2026\~
