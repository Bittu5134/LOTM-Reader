## Chapter 606: Faith Conversion

At 8 a.m., in the prayer room on the third floor of the cabin, Lugano
stepped in. Father Montserrat, draped in a brown priest's robe, was
already preaching. Five or six individuals were scattered in the rows of
chairs before the Sacred Emblem of Life.

Without disturbing the sanctified ambiance, Lugano chose a spot at the
front, near a supplicant.

As Father Montserrat concluded his sermon and closed the Holy Bible, the
supplicants rose, spread their feet, and raised their palms high,
chanting in unison, "Praise the Earth, praise the Mother of All Things!"

Lugano instinctively turned his head, noticing a tightly-wrapped up
supplicant with brown eyes and a pale complexion in the same row---Enio,
the special patient who had lost his internal organs.

*H-he's not dead? Wait, isn't the evil warlock, Prinpino, supposed to be
dead? Why is Enio, the special patient, still alive?* Lugano was
stunned, almost convinced he'd encountered a ghost.

Being a Sequence 8 of the Planter pathway, he was ill-equipped to handle
ghosts.

But then, Lugano observed that Enio's face wasn't as deathly pale as
before. The brilliance in his eyes had returned, and vitality coursed
through him.

*Wh...* Lugano raised his hand, tapping his glabella to activate
his Spirit Vision.

He observed Enio's Ether Body, no longer as ashen as before. Whether it
be the yellow hue symbolizing the digestive system, the orange hue
denoting detoxification and organ excretion, or other shades, they had
reverted to a semblance of normalcy, albeit faint and thin.

*Is that even possible? Hadn't he lost his heart, liver, spleen, lungs,
intestines, stomach, and kidneys?* Lugano stared at Enio as
though he were an aberration until Enio pivoted and pleasantly
recognized him.

"Doctor, your treatment works wonders. I feel like I'm recovering!" Enio
exclaimed joyously.

And this was just the initial treatment sans pinpointing the specific
cause!

Lugano's lips twitched stiffly.

"That's reassuring, indeed."

"Are you also a follower of Earth Mother?" Enio beamed, pleasantly
surprised.

*I'm not. Spare me the talk of Mother God or Mother... As an Intisian,
how can I subscribe to the Earth Mother faith?* Lugano gestured
toward Montserrat, evading a direct response.

"I need to discuss matters with the priest."

Enio nodded.

"When can I seek further treatment in the morning?"

*You don't require treatment anymore. It's time for recuperation and
repose...* Lugano grumbled, forcing a smile.

"In about an hour."

"Thank you, Doctor!" Enio waved, exiting the prayer room.

When only Lugano and Father Montserrat remained, Lugano hushed his
voice, gesturing toward the door.

"H-how was he healed?"

Father Montserrat, still relatively youthful with sincere eyes, smiled
and responded, "Thanks to Earth Mother, his fortune was favorable.

"As a Doctor yourself, you must be aware that internal organs can be
transplanted as long as they maintain a certain level of vitality. For
the ritual to succeed, Prinpino utilized his Beyonder powers to sustain
the vitality of those internal organs. Moreover, the set he employed was
extracted from Enio, eliminating the need to consider transplant
rejection effects.

"Furthermore, Enio remained alive, relying on mystical power to uphold a
certain level of vitality. This was a crucial factor."

"Did you perform surgery on him last night and transplant all his
internal organs back?" Lugano was enlightened.

Father Montserrat nodded.

"For regular surgeons, this is an operation with nearly zero chances of
success. Even if successful, keeping the patient alive long enough to
navigate the most perilous stage is challenging. However, for us, it
falls within our capabilities."

*Indeed... Compared to ordinary surgeons, Beyonder Doctors like us wield
mystical powers akin to miracle-workers...* Lugano sighed,
dismissing further concern about Enio. Turning to Montserrat, he
inquired with worry, "Father, I heard a baby crying again.

"Has that so-called Child of God set his sights on me?"

Father Montserrat reassured him, "Fear not. It's an inevitable
repercussion of the corresponding corruption. It will gradually
dissipate over time. If you're concerned about any unforeseen events or
accidents on your path, I can help you eliminate them now."

*Is that so? You're merely a Sequence 8 Doctor. Do you possess the
capability to rid me of the remaining corruption? Set up an altar and
seek Earth Mother's aid?* Lugano remained skeptical.

"Thank you, Father!"

Montserrat gestured toward Lugano's previous spot.

"Follow the believers' example. Close your eyes, listen to my preaching,
and simultaneously, pray to Earth Mother. Remember, it's specifically to
Earth Mother, no other deity."

"Understood." Lugano resumed his seat, crossed his arms, and shut his
eyes.

As Father Montserrat delivered his sermon, Lugano silently echoed the
verses of the Holy Bible. Gradually, his thoughts blurred, and amidst
the discourse, Lugano discerned a mother's gentle murmur and felt the
comforting warmth of her embrace.

His tense heart eased, reminiscent of seeking solace in his mother's
arms after childhood bullying.

It was a blend of dependency, reliance, and a sanctuary for the mind.

Unbeknownst to him, tears trickled down Lugano's cheeks, as if purifying
his body and soul.

Slowly, his emotions settled, dispelling the fear and unease.

"Done." Father Montserrat's voice seemed to waft from the distance,
reaching Lugano's ears.

Opening his eyes, Lugano raised his right hand, wiping away the tears.

Standing up, he lifted his hands.

"Praise the Earth, praise the Mother of All Things!"

It was an almost reflexive response.

In that moment, sunlight streamed through the window, casting a faint
golden glow upon the prayer room, as if heralding forthcoming abundance.

Father Montserrat nodded in satisfaction.

"Earth Mother has purged the corruption from your body. Tonight, pay
attention and see if you still hear the baby's cries."

"Alright, Father!" Lugano replied, his body and mind now at ease.

The next morning, he awoke with a sense of happiness.

Throughout the night, he experienced no dreams of a beckoning mother,
nor did he hear the cries of the so-called Child of God.

Filled with joy, Lugano, after serving Ludwig breakfast, hurried to the
prayer room to share the uplifting news with Father Montserrat.

Father Montserrat gazed at him for a moment and asked with a smile, "Are
you interested in embracing Mother Earth?"

"Me?" Lugano hesitated before inquiring, "Are you willing to accept the
conversion of a heretic?"

Father Montserrat smiled and replied, "In the Mother's eyes, there are
no heretics. There are only children who are or are not willing to
return home."

Lugano's heart wavered, reflecting on his past actions of merely going
through the motions in cathedrals---praying, listening to preaching, and
attending Mass. He hadn't truly believed in any deity, and the Church
hadn't provided substantial assistance.

*Moreover, if I truly become a believer in Earth Mother, I might gain
access to subsequent potion formulas and Beyonder ingredients from the
Church or the three Orders... Even if not, I'll surely receive
corresponding mysticism guidance...* Lugano hesitated, finding
various excuses to convince himself.

Father Montserrat patiently waited, not pressuring him. He simply
smiled, anticipating Lugano's decision.

Eventually, Lugano raised his hands.

"Praise the Earth, praise the Mother of All Things!"

He responded to Father Montserrat's proselytization in this manner.

Father Montserrat's smile broadened as he extended his arms.

"Welcome home."

Those words oddly warmed Lugano's heart. It felt as though, after years
of wandering and adventuring, he had finally returned home.

Fatigue lifted, and a sense of grounding enveloped him.

"Praise Mother Earth." Lugano crossed his arms over his chest.

Father Montserrat nodded and commenced his true preaching.

"You believe in the source of life, the mother of all things, the
propagation of the fertile land, the symbol of the crimson moon and
reproduction, as well as the destination and the starting point of
everything..."

Lugano listened attentively, committing the information to memory.

Though not devout yet, this might become his future sanctuary. He
recognized the importance of presenting his good side at all times.

Upon returning to the first-class suite, Lugano glanced nervously at
Lumian, who was engrossed in studying the Southern Continent's Dutanese,
and stammered, "I-I've changed my faith to Earth Mother."

As a fellow Intisian, would he despise and scorn me?

Lumian looked up and chuckled.

"Then make sure to radiate maternal brilliance. Ludwig is counting on
you for some fresh fish."

*He doesn't mind at all...* Lugano mumbled, not willing to let
Ludwig go hungry. He embarked on a busy day.

Late at night, after tending to Ludwig until bedtime, Lugano pondered
briefly and decided to visit the prayer room.

If the door was still ajar, he intended to offer a prayer before
retiring for the night.

He had to make a good impression right from the beginning!

Lugano treaded the dimly lit stairs, approaching the prayer room with
cautious steps on the creaking floor.

His footfalls grew hushed, wary of disturbing those engaged in prayer
and potentially interrupting Father Montserrat's embodiment of Mother
Earth's teachings through reproductive activities with a female
believer.

Reaching the door quietly, Lugano extended his right hand, gently
pushing it open.

The wooden door eased ajar, revealing a small gap without a sound.

*It's not shut tight... Is he truly in the midst of
reproduction?* Lugano cautiously peered into the opening.

He observed the crimson moonlight enveloping the prayer room and Father
Montserrat, draped in a brown priest's robe, standing before the Sacred
Emblem of Life. Folding his arms, Father Montserrat swayed gently, as if
cradling a newborn child.

However, there was nothing within his embrace.
