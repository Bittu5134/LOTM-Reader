## Chapter 836: Unorthodox Feint

Albus transformed into a blazing-white, blue-tinged flaming spear,
flying to the peak of the corpse mountain, toward Julie's filthy blood
descending onto the charred 0-01 banner.

But in the blink of an eye, he lost his target, reverting from his fiery
state to land beside the corpse where 0-01 should have been embedded.

At the peak, opening his eyes no longer seemed an issue, but Albus
Medici's vision no longer contained the charred banner, Julie's filthy
bloody, or Celeste.

With his past experience, Albus quickly understood what was happening:

This was the mirror world, or a Mirror Maze!

After waiting so long at the peak, Celeste must have made some
preparations!

As Albus guessed, this was a Mirror Maze created by multiple mirrors
reflecting each other. Celeste stood outside, her gaze pained and
distant as she watched the filthy blood race towards the charred flag.

For some reason, the filthy bloody slowed its descent, as if repelled by
0-01, but it still sank inexorably, just at a reduced pace.

Albus tried using the crystal necklace coiled around his wrist but found
no mirror world to traverse or escape through, confirming he was trapped
in the Mirror Maze. He immediately condensed blazing white, blue-tinged
fireballs, sending them in all directions to blast the hidden mirrors
forming the maze.

As its name implied, the Mirror Maze was just a maze, not a true barrier
with defenses!

Thunderous explosions erupted almost simultaneously, yet Albus still
could not break through the Mirror Maze.

Not a single mirror had been damaged!

With a slight narrowing of his eyes, Albus decisively abandoned any
further such attempts.

Outside the Mirror Maze, Celeste felt the explosive winds and inwardly
scoffed.

*In other locations, widespread bombardment might overwhelm a Mirror
Maze meant to trap Hunters. But here at the corpse mountain's peak, the
heart of 0-01's seal, it would not be so easy.*

As a Demoness of Affliction corrupted by 0-01 to some degree like Julie,
Celeste could wield traces of that special mirror world's power!

The Mirror Maze's mirrors were not at the peak itself, but scattered
among the corpses and bones below, their reflections then projected
around 0-01's vicinity through that special mirror world, forming the
Mirror Maze.

Seeing Julie's filthy blood nearing the charred banner, Celeste felt a
mix of elation and confusion, underlaid by anguish.

From somewhere, she produced a black teardrop-like ornament and affixed
it to between her brows.

Inside the Mirror Maze, Albus calmly lowered his head and half-closed
his eyes, preparing to do what would inevitably be required.

He murmured in ancient Hermes, "The great God of War, the symbol of iron
and blood, the ruler of chaos and strife."

With this three-passage invocation of the honorific name, the iron-black
metal flagpole suspending the charred banner shuddered slightly, its
drooping flag fully unfurling with a rattling sound despite the
stillness, each bloody stain growing vivid.

Julie's filthy bloody halted, hovering a couple meters from 0-01, as if
grasped by an unseen hand.

High above, clouds rapidly swirled into an immense vortex tinged with
faint purple firelight, larger than the mountain itself, its far end
suggesting some vast entity straining against an invisible barrier.

Cracks spread from the Salinger's Blood Banner with snapping sounds, the
special mirror world over the peak shattering.

The Mirror Maze dissipated as its special mirror world projection broke
apart.

Albus's head snapped up, his irises now flecked with iron-black, a
bloody mark stark on his brow.

His gaze fell on Celeste, now adorned with her own black teardrop
ornament, meeting her eyes.

Before combat could erupt, Lumian nonchalantly climbed over the peak's
edge, a mere seven or eight meters from 0-01.

No communication was needed as Albus and Celeste simultaneously attacked
Lumian.

Albus casually thrust out a fist expelling a massive blue-tinged
fireball, while frost coalesced around Celeste's head into mirrors, each
preceding an eerie, smoldering black flame.

But just as Celeste's icy mirrors would have reflected Lumian, his
figure faded, vanishing with a mocking smile.

Behind him, an immense silhouette suddenly loomed into Albus and
Celeste's view.

Already over five or six meters tall yet still growing, twisting
appendages sprouting, it was covered in patches of brown bark and
sickening knobs that oozed clear fluid from the gaps.

For now, the monstrosity cradled a blood-stained, vertebrae-trailing
head in one hand, its silvery-black empty eyes dead and sunken.

On either shoulder was a fleshy, head-sized bulge, the surface rippling
with some contained liquid.

The next second, the monster leaped to the peak, shedding puddles of
wriggling maggot-flesh.

Countless black gaseous tendrils dragged at it from behind, trying to
pull it back into the sleek, iron-black breastplate mirror.

The mere sight catalyzed a visceral sensation of corruption in Albus and
Celeste.

Celeste's hair billowed outward, rapidly thickening and coarsening,
while Albus's face became mapped with protruding black veins.

*Boom!*

Albus's immense blue-tinged fireball with white remnants exploded
against the monstrosity as Celeste's flickering array of frost-mirrors
reflected its figure, engulfing it in roiling black flames.

*Crack!*

The monster shattered mirror-like, its silhouette immediately
reappearing beside 0-01, making Albus and Celeste's scalps prickle---it
could use Mirror Substitution too.

Raising its severed head, the monstrosity emitted a sound like it came
from another world.

Celeste felt herself plunged into cloying, frozen blackness, constrained
on all sides in inescapable oppression.

Albus likewise found himself surrounded by stifling darkness.

This was a mystic technique inspired by the Mirror Person's state of
being.

At that moment, Lumian, having teleported away to avoid the earlier
clash, reappeared at the corpse peak's base.

His silhouette flickered behind Albus in the darkness, mouth opening to
harrumph, sending a pale-yellow gaseous breath that washed over him.

For an instant, Albus's eyes went blank, his body swaying before he
recovered his senses.

The Red Angel had helped him resist part of the Spell of Harrumph's
effects.

Seizing Albus's momentary disorientation, Lumian's left fist blazed with
white flames as he struck at his vulnerable point---the neck connecting
head and body.

Cull!

As Lumian's fist neared Albus's neck, the member of the Medici family
transformed into a humanoid blaze of white, blue-tinged fire.

Not the merger with a flaming spear, but transmutation into living flame
itself.

In this fiery state, his neck was no longer a weakness!

*Bang!*

Lumian's punch only made the flaming figure waver and dim slightly.

In the next instant, Albus became a roaring blue-tinged flaming spear,
bursting through the black icy shackles into the air.

Wheeling about like a javelin cast from the high vortex's hidden depths,
he unleashed dozens of blue-streaked white fireballs in a thunderous
barrage toward the peak.

*Boom! Rumble! Boom boom!*

Horrific explosions engulfed the area in relentless succession.

The indescribable monstrosity repeatedly used Mirror Substitution yet
could not escape the bombardment's range.

Meanwhile, Lumian had teleported pre-emptively back to the mountain's
base.

*Still teleporting? Hand Bro isn't dead yet?* As a chill ran
down Lumian's back, he saw Celeste's face reflected in a nearby corpse's
smooth breastplate.

The Demoness had not met Albus's assault with Mirror Substitution,
instead deploying a mirror to swiftly traverse the mirror world to the
wasteland---one of Lumian's backup plans.

Seeing she did not immediately attack him, Lumian turned his gaze back
toward the peak.

He did not regret missing the opportunity to eliminate Albus earlier, as
that was the outcome he wanted.

If he had intended to kill Albus with that strike, he would not have
used only his Cull ability---he would have surely drawn the Sword of
Courage or attacked in his Desire Incarnation form instead.

*If I killed Albus now, who would help me deal with Celeste and that
monster? Just me alone? *Lumian inwardly muttered with obvious
malice.

His earlier attack had a hidden purpose:

to deceive Albus into thinking his defenses were ineffective against
Lumian, to make him believe the pitch-black bone ring on his hand could
not target him.

Then, at the crucial moment, he could "surprise" Albus by exploiting
this misconception!

The thunderous explosions finally subsided. The corpses and bones atop
the peak had suffered severe damage, and Julie's filthy blood had
dissipated somewhat.

The indescribable monster no longer had Mirror Substitution, its surface
charred and tattered.

Albus reappeared, his iron-black eyes lifting his right hand to push
forward.

A spiraling storm of white-blue Fire Ravens flocked relentlessly toward
the monster's exposed abdomen in overwhelming numbers.

*Rumble!*

Its weak point battered, the staggering monster collapsed into
fragments.

Seeing this, Lumian instantly drew a straight sword resembling the Sword
of Courage and teleported to the peak, while Celeste also raced toward
it.
