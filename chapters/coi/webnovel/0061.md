## Chapter 61: Description

The more Lumian listened to the lady in front of him, the more he
concurred.

He was uncertain about what would happen at a higher Sequence. Among the
few Beyonder creatures he had interacted with, the threat posed by the
fellow with the vortex-shaped proboscis was far inferior to the monster
carrying a shotgun.

Although he had become a Beyonder, significantly improving his close
combat ability and exploitation of the environment, the problem
primarily lay with the Contractee monster.

Firstly, it did not display a relatively strong pursuit ability.
Secondly, it lacked long-range attacks. Thirdly, its invisibility
ability was not ridiculous. It was completely countered by a Hunter's
grasp of the surrounding environment and minute traces.

Moreover, it had the common problem of monsters. It did not have high
intelligence and was not as combat-intelligent as the shotgun monster.
It had easily stepped into the enemy's trap.

With all of this combined, the final outcome was obvious. Lumian just
never expected it to be equivalent to a Sequence 7.

He didn't even compare it to the shotgun monster, recognizing the vast
difference between the two. The shotgun monster was a force to be
reckoned with, while the mouth orifice monster was weak.

*Ability, intelligence, preparation, improvisation, environmental
factors... There are too many variables that can affect the outcome of a
battle...* Lumian concluded inwardly and asked without much
hope, "Can I directly pray for Contractee powers?"

The lady chuckled. "That's a good way to kill yourself."

She casually explained, "In theory, it's possible. After all, the power
sealed in your body isn't limited to the Sequence 7 equivalent. But can
your body withstand such a tremendous boon or rather, corruption? If you
don't mind turning into a monster, a puppet of that existence, or
transforming into another creature, then go ahead. Tsk, then it won't be
long before I see you personally turning your sister into a sacrifice."

Lumian's hair stood on end from the woman's words, and a chill ran down
his spine, realizing that he wasn't ready to advance beyond his current
level.

He cautiously asked, "So, the most significant boon I can handle right
now is a Dancer?"

"Yes, that's why I waited for you to become a Beyonder and digest some
of it before telling you about it," the woman explained, taking another
sip of her green liquid. "Only when your mind, spirituality, and body
have improved significantly will you have a chance of resisting the
corruption attached to the boon. Then, you can slowly control the power.

"As your Soul Body and Body of Heart and Mind strengthen, and your body
adapts to the slight changes brought about by the power of the boon, you
can consider Alms Monk."

For Lumian, the most crucial thing was to learn the mysterious dance.
Initiating the incomplete activation of the thorn symbol would
significantly improve his ability to explore the dream ruins. Therefore,
he nodded slightly, no longer thinking about Alms Monk and Contractee.

"How should I pray?"

He had already learned the duality ritual, but he still didn't know the
target's honorific name, domain, and corresponding ingredients.

"Ahem," the lady coughed.

Then, she spoke solemnly, "What I'm about to say shall leave my mouth
and enter your ears... You must not tell anyone, or you'll harm them."

*Leave my mouth and enter your ears... This is a sentence Aurore likes
to write... Has this lady read one of her novels?* Lumian
thought.

"I understand."

He thought for a moment and asked, "Will anything go wrong from hearing
it?"

The lady took a sip of absinthe fennel and smiled.

"When did you have the illusion that there's nothing wrong with you?"

Lumian was stunned for a moment before looking down at his left pec.

The lady scoffed.

"You belong to the group of individuals who are on the brink of being
corrupted. Luckily, the mark left by that great existence was activated,
and the corresponding power descended upon you, sealing the source of
corruption and establishing balance.

"Next, you will perform a ritual to confront the power within the seal
and pray for the corresponding blessings. It is akin to proactively
withstanding a certain level of corruption.

"So, why should you be afraid of minor issues that you hear?"

*The more I hear, the more I feel that there's a huge
problem...* Lumian wasn't too confident.

The lady shook her head and smiled.

"Do not fret. When I reveal the corresponding words, I will provide you
with a sufficiently concealed environment and secure protection. In the
future, it would be best to perform the ritual in the ruins, where there
is gray fog and the protection of the great existence. It will not
directly draw the attention of that entity.

"Furthermore, before the ritual, scramble every segment and description.
Attempt not to piece them together and analyze them in a complete
manner. Otherwise, heh..."

She chuckled and did not elaborate on the outcome, but Lumian could
imagine what would occur.

Observing that he did not inquire further, the woman nodded slightly.

"Let us commence.

"The first part is the Power of Inevitability.

"Using it is sufficient. It corresponds with your black thorn symbol.
The complete name of that being is not something you can comprehend at
the moment. Even I must provide some concealment before daring to
contemplate it."

For some reason, Lumian felt the light around him diminish slightly, but
he was unsure.

At that moment, the woman controlled her expression and said solemnly,
"The second part is:

"You are the past, the present, and the future.

"You are the cause, the effect, and the process..."

As the lady enunciated each word with precision, Lumian felt his senses
spin. He realized that a vortex of dark wind was enveloping him.

The table, on which his absinthe fennel rested, writhed as if imbued
with a life force of its own.

Suddenly, a sharp sound echoed.

An ebony worm, as long as an adult's index finger, slithered out of the
wooden board, and an ominous aura spread instantaneously.

Before Lumian could observe the worm's features, the woman sitting
across from him lowered her cup filled with the green liquid and slammed
it onto the grotesque creature, reducing it to a pulpy mess.

Next, the woman produced a patterned napkin, wiped the glass's base
clean, and wrapped the worm's remains in it.

She took another sip of the absinthe fennel, as if nothing untoward had
occurred, and emphasized, "Remember, the first and second parts must be
recited in ancient Hermes. Jotun, Dragonese, and Elvish are acceptable
as well."

*Similar to how the initial "I" in the rite that worships oneself cannot
be in Hermes...* Lumian nodded to indicate his comprehension.

Although he had always been audacious, he felt slightly discomfited and
uneasy when confronted with the strange phenomena that kept manifesting
during their conversation. His heart raced, but the enigmatic woman
acted as if she had merely detected some impurities in their meal. She
continued,

"The third part can be spoken in Hermes. The text is as follows:

"I implore you,

"I beseech your benediction.

"I plead with you to grant me the power of Dancer.

"Remember, the three sentences are progressive."

These words did not elicit a new environmental shift. The anomalies that
had caused Lumian's unease and trepidation gradually subsided.

Lumian committed them to memory earnestly and followed the woman's
instructions to scramble the words, to prevent any potential issues.

The woman savored the remaining absinthe fennel with satisfaction.

"The rest of the ritual is similar to common ritualistic magic."

"The corresponding ingredients are gray amber, tulips, cloves, and deer
musk. Choose any two to make candles. The remaining two can be used as
herbs, essential oil, and extract during the ritual."

Lumian furrowed his brow as he recalled the dualistic ritual he had
learned.

"The spot representing the deity should have an item that's closely
related to the deity, but my thorn symbol is on my chest. I can't skin
it, right? Besides, I doubt it's useful even if I skin it."

The power was sealed in his heart and Spirit Body.

The woman nodded slightly.

"Didn't I tell you to make candles?

"When making the candle, take 5 milliliters of blood from your chest. It
doesn't matter if it's more or less. In any case, fuse it into the
material and let it become a part of the candle.

"In the ritual, the candle is placed in the deity's location. There's
only one candle.

"Because of your blood, the candle is 'awakened' by ancient Hermes.
After becoming a symbol, it will point directly at you. Then, with the
subsequent description, it will activate the power sealed in you to a
certain extent."

*It feels like a special variant of the dualistic ritual. Aurore didn't
mention that it could be done like this, so not many people know about
it... *Lumian thought for a moment and asked, "Can I use perfume
with gray amber?"

He remembered that his sister had it, and she liked to call gray amber
'ambergris.'

The woman nodded. "Sure, use it like an essential oil."

*I possess the gray amber in that case. I have some cloves at
home...* Lumian pondered where he could acquire tulips and deer
musk.

After much contemplation, he could only come up with three
possibilities:

Firstly, Aurore, being a Warlock, might have already prepared the
required materials. Secondly, the materials could be found at the
administrator's residence. Thirdly, the padre's house could be a
potential source.

Lumian decided to inform his sister about the ritual and break down the
instructions into individual words. He planned to learn the
corresponding ancient Hermes and Hermes words from her and inquire about
the availability of the materials.

If she didn't have them, he would explore other options.

As the lady was about to depart, Lumian hastily questioned, "What was
that lizard that crawled out of the deputy padre's mouth?"

The lady smiled and replied, "I cannot explain it to you."

Lumian struggled to maintain his composure and thought, *Why not just
say you don't want to tell me...*

After the lady left, Lumian retrieved the pen and paper he had brought
and jotted down the ritual instructions in a disordered manner. He then
numbered them in the correct sequence.

Upon leaving Ol' Tavern, Lumian scoured the village for the trio of
foreigners.

It didn't take long before he heard a faint tinkling sound.

Lumian's lips curved into a smile as he quickened his pace. As expected,
Leah wore two bells on her veil and boots, Ryan donned a dark bowler
hat, and Valentine had sprinkled powder on his head.

Lumian had an urge to open his arms and exclaim, "My cabbages, I missed
you so much!" but he quickly remembered that he had not interacted with
the foreigners in this cycle.

He kneaded his face to appear more serious and strode towards Ryan and
the others.

As he brushed past them, he lowered his voice and said, "I know who
you're searching for."

Ryan, Leah, and Valentine gaped at him in astonishment.

Lumian didn't pause; he continued walking forward.

The three foreigners exchanged glances, suppressed their peculiar
expressions, and followed behind Lumian as if nothing had happened.
