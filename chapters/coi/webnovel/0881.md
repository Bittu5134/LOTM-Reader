## Chapter 881: Three Times

Voisin Sanson felt there was no warmth in the voice's laughter, and he
suddenly shuddered, snapping back to reality.

His first reaction was to quickly teleport out of this area, because
Lumian had become a potion pathway demigod, and still had three
companions assisting him. Meanwhile, Sanson's ally, the other demigod
Higdon, had been completely killed by Lumian in a very short time.

No matter how devoutly he believed in the great Circle of Inevitability,
no matter how urgently he longed to rescue Lord Termiboros, the Angel of
Inevitability, today, Voisin Sanson was not so blind as to misread the
current situation.

He knew he only had two choices: stay and fight to the death, or flee
quickly and wait for another opportunity.

At this moment, it was not difficult to decide which to choose.

As the black mark on his body activated, Voisin Sanson's figure
disappeared from where he stood.

The next second, he appeared dozens of meters away, facing a dark,
transparent, almost glass-like barrier ahead.

The barrier flickered in and out of visibility, sealing off an area the
size of a plaza.

Lumian, his body now slightly slimmer, held the huge iron-black straight
sword and did not stop Voisin Sanson's attempt. He only said in a
slightly mocking tone, "This is the special mirror world, and a
demigod-level Demoness can utilize the power of this world to some
extent.

"If you want to break the mirror barrier and 'teleport' out, there's
only one way---defeat me, kill me."

Voisin Sanson struggled for a moment but failed to succeed. He had no
choice but to turn around and face Lumian.

Then he saw the other reveal a beautiful but dangerous smile.

Lumian did not act immediately, because he was listening to the beating
of his own heart.

The seal of Mr. Fool on him had lost its effect, but Amon had left some
power in the original position, preventing the soul fragments of Aurore
and others from leaking out and perishing completely.

Of course, this was only a temporary restriction. In two or three days
at most, the seal would completely dissipate.

And because of the vast difference in strength between the two seals,
Lumian felt that the distance between himself and his sister had
shortened considerably, as if he could hear her voice and receive her
thoughts.

*Thump, thump, thump.*

That heartbeat was familiar and warm.

"Do you see? Voisin Sanson is right in front of us, that heretic who
always made you have nightmares, who scared you into fleeing Trier.

"Do you see? He's afraid."

Lumian whispered these two sentences with a gentle expression, then
raised his head and cast his gaze toward Voisin Sanson.

During this process, he teleported several times in succession, changing
his position to prevent Voisin Sanson's attacks from affecting him.

Lumian slightly arched his back and gripped the Sword of Courage with
both hands.

The next second, his figure suddenly faded, blinking to the front of
Voisin Sanson, seemingly intending to ignore the other's counterattack
and forcibly cleave the target in two.

Voisin Sanson did not hesitate because of how beautiful this image was
or how alluring this figure was. Relying on the endurance ability of an
Ascetic, he concentrated dark green light in his eyes.

As the beam surged forth, Lumian had already become transparent, turning
into a mirror.

*Smack!*

Just as the mirror shattered, Lumian's figure appeared behind Voisin
Sanson, maintaining the downward slashing motion with the iron-black
straight sword.

Voisin Sanson quickly let the semi-transparent figure resembling himself
emerge, staring at Lumian.

But Lumian's figure suddenly became illusory, as if reflected in a
mirror.

At the same time, Lumian materialized above Voisin Sanson's head,
holding the iron-black straight sword burning with white-blue flames; he
completed the last motion of this attack with a jumping slash.

*Clang!*

The Sword of Courage struck the junction between Voisin Sanson's neck
and shoulder, directly cleaving open the skin and flesh gleaming with
metallic luster, staining it with bright red blood.

Immediately after, a violent explosion occurred, and Voisin Sanson's
body was about to be torn apart.

At this moment, Lumian was slightly dazed, while Voisin Sanson instantly
returned to his original state, teleporting to the other side of the
sealed area.

Lumian did not pursue closely, but turned his body to face the
white-haired fatalist and said with a smile, "First time."

Voisin Sanson immediately felt his scalp tingle, understanding that the
other meant he had already killed him once, with many more times to
come.

He immediately activated a contract ability called "Phantom".

He suddenly split into dozens of copies of himself, and each Voisin
Sanson seemed capable of teleporting, appearing in different positions
and corners of the sealed area.

They simultaneously raised their right hands, their eyes reflecting the
corresponding mercury-colored illusory river of Lumian.

This could be either Magnified Fate or Fate Exchange!

And Lumian seemed unable to distinguish which Voisin Sanson was real,
unable to effectively prevent it.

Lumian's light blue eyes smiled without mirth.

He glanced at the Sword of Courage and found that Voisin Sanson's blood,
which should have stained it, had disappeared, as if returning to the
body of that Circle Inhabitant.

Lumian was not surprised. He suddenly threw the Sword of Courage,
hurling it towards the center of the sealed area.

The huge iron-black straight sword fell to the ground like a cannonball.

*Rumble!*

A massive explosion suddenly occurred, shaking even the special mirror
world, and white-blue flames quickly covered every inch of ground and
every bit of air in the sealed area.

This was why Lumian had limited the battlefield to the size of a plaza.

The phantoms created by Voisin Sanson were quickly destroyed. After
struggling to resist for two seconds, his true body shattered,
triggering the Circle Inhabitant effect.

Lumian himself was also engulfed by the explosion, the flames scorching
his skin, the shockwave tearing at his body.

Then, he turned into a mirror.

The mirror immediately shattered.

As the explosion quickly subsided, Lumian looked at Voisin Sanson, who
was far away from him, and smiled more obviously.

"Second time."

His clear light blue eyes, like highland lakes, still held no mirth.

As he spoke, invisible spider silk extended from Lumian's body, binding
the hilt of the Sword of Courage and dragging it back.

Realizing that the area-of-effect attack of the iron-black straight
sword could completely cover this area, and that none of his contract
abilities were sufficient to withstand such an explosion, Voisin Sanson
was overcome with a feeling called despair.

Although before chasing here, he had already canceled the previous
Circle Inhabitant effect and waited for the restriction to end,
resetting the same Circle Inhabitant with nine more chances to trigger,
now with seven left, if Lumian were to throw that iron-black straight
sword again and again, repeating the area-of-effect explosion from
earlier, he didn't think seven Circle Inhabitant effects would have much
significance.

Unless that iron-black straight sword needed some time between such
attacks.

Voisin Sanson dared not gamble. He chose to end the Circle Inhabitant
effect on himself.

His right hand pressed towards Lumian's approaching figure from a
distance, and silver-white lines with black edges appeared in his eyes.

These lines twisted like snakes, framing Lumian's figure in the middle,
then quickly connected head to tail.

Voisin Sanson wanted to make Lumian a Circle Inhabitant!

Different types of Circle Inhabitant effects didn't need to wait for
restrictions to end.

And in the same time period, Voisin Sanson, at only Sequence 4, could
maintain only one "Circle".

His preset condition now was that if Lumian made any move to attack him,
it would trigger the Circle Inhabitant effect, resetting the state of
this Demoness of Despair---such harsh conditions couldn't be placed on
an area-of-effect Circle Inhabitant, and would be suppressed by the
target's level, not achieving the best effect, unlike the area-of-effect
Circle Inhabitant which could affect even Angel-level Beyonders.

The Inevitability power Voisin Sanson attached to this Circle Inhabitant
could only maintain three cycles. Once it exceeded three times and
started the fourth, the destined fate would arrive.

Of course, what exactly this destined fate would be needed to be chosen
by Voisin Sanson himself.

Because he had to complete this "Circle" quickly, otherwise Lumian could
launch an attack first, Voisin Sanson had no time to discern carefully.
He just glanced and chose a tributary from Lumian's illusory
mercury-colored long river, placing it into the circle.

It was the tributary of the Mirror People being hostile to this Demoness
of Despair, which could help Voisin Sanson destroy the surrounding
mirror barriers, giving him a chance to teleport and escape.

The worse the destined fate, the worse the final result, the more
Inevitability power Voisin Sanson had to invest, and the longer it would
take to complete the Circle Inhabitant, which was not suitable for the
current situation.

As soon as this "circle" was completed, Lumian immediately had a
spiritual intuition and put down the Sword of Courage in his hand, no
longer advancing.

Seeing this, Voisin Sanson instinctively concentrated dark green light
in his eyes.

Those two beams shot out like light, instantly falling on Lumian, who
once again turned into a mirror, his body materializing not far from his
original position.

Seeing this, Voisin Sanson suddenly froze.

*Why didn't Harrison and I think of using this method to trap Lumian
when facing his attacks?*

*That way we could have resolved the battle faster, without needing to
be killed several times...*

And now, he still had who knows how many Mirror Substitutions.

Voisin Sanson quickly decided to provoke Lumian to attack. His eyes once
again lit up with a dark green hue.

Just then, even with the endurance of an Ascetic, Voisin Sanson couldn't
help but cough once, causing the dark green beam in his eyes to deviate
from its target and fall on the distant mirror barrier.

The barrier was slightly damaged but instantly repaired itself.

Voisin Sanson began to feel his body weakening, each breath feeling like
his airways were being scorched by flames.

His spirituality was also rapidly depleting.

*Disease... I've been infected by the Demoness's disease!*
Voisin Sanson suddenly raised his head, just in time to see Lumian
reveal a mocking but beautiful smile.

"Why did you think the explosion and incineration from earlier could
directly kill my mystical pathogens?

"They can persist for quite a while longer."

Voisin Sanson's heart tightened, and he frantically attacked Lumian, but
only managed to shatter three or four mirrors.

And with each ineffective attack, Voisin Sanson grew more desperate. He
seemed to already see the worst outcome approaching, yet was powerless
to reverse it, only able to watch helplessly as the bell of death
tolled.

He even tried to metallize his body, but the disease could still infect
him, eating into him.

*Cough, cough, cough!*

After many more attempts, Voisin Sanson finally lost the strength to
stand. He collapsed to the ground, coughing violently as he fell.

He no longer had the power to maintain the Circle Inhabitant effect on
Lumian.

Lumian walked step by step to the front of this Circle Inhabitant,
looking down at him from above, and said with a mocking smile, "Only
three times?"

Voisin Sanson raised his head with difficulty, looking at that beautiful
and cold face, feeling as if he was rapidly falling into a bottomless
abyss.

That feeling was the epitome of despair.

Lumian bound Voisin Sanson with a spider web, suspending him in the air,
then formed a sharp, thick ice pillar beneath him.

"Goodbye, give my regards to your master," Lumian said softly,
retracting all the spider silk.

*Pfft!*

Voisin Sanson fell heavily, impaled by the ice pillar.

His eyes bulged, and blood flowed beneath him.
