## Chapter 1179: Dreams

"When you need to advance to Sequence 3, you can come to me." Franca
stood at the street corner, took out the Face of the Arcane from her
Traveler's Bag, and showed it briefly.

Melissa smiled and nodded, waving goodbye to this enthusiastic older
sister before heading towards the research institute under the God of
Steam and Machinery Church.

After chatting leisurely for over an hour at the café, Franca had
accompanied her all the way here.

Only when Melissa's figure disappeared at the building's entrance did
Franca turn around, strolling leisurely under the shadows of Intis
parasol trees, blending into the lively streets.

Along the way, she saw the Trier citizens who, as always, loved to stand
out. She also spotted Daoists and monks traveling from the Northern
Continent, and many young people from the Western Continent here on
studying abroad exchanges. Some maintained their original clothing
styles, while others adapted to local customs.

Franca also noticed many newly built cathedrals, belonging respectively
to the Church of The Fool, Eternal Darkness Church, and the Ruler of
Calamity Church---the three mainstream faiths in the world today.

The Eternal Darkness Church had evolved from the merger of the Evernight
Goddess Church with the Churches of the God of Combat and the Death. The
Ruler of Calamity Church originated from the Sick Church and the
Demoness Sect.

Among the remaining orthodox churches, only the Church of the God of
Steam and Machinery maintained its former influence. The Churches of the
Eternal Blazing Sun, Lord of Storms, Earth Mother, and the God of
Knowledge and Wisdom still existed but had become secondary choices with
limited influence. Many Trier citizens even followed trends, engaging in
Daoist practices or Zen meditation.

As her thoughts drifted, Franca cast her gaze towards the distant
Eternal Blazing Sun cathedral.

Even across a sizable square, the stained glass windows of the cathedral
vividly projected the interior scene into Franca's eyes.

At the altar stood a golden-embedded cross, and before it, a figure
knelt quietly in prayer.

The figure had long silver hair and wore a simple linen robe. It was
none other than Angel of Fate Ouroboros.

He had returned from the Western Continent, merging the Aurora Order
with the Eternal Blazing Sun Church, turning the Aurora Order into the
shadow under the sun's rays, handling tasks inconvenient for clergy, and
executing acts of punishment.

Franca sighed with mixed feelings and withdrew her gaze.

Naturally, she thought of another King of Angels in the domain of
fate---Will Auceptin, who had also returned to Backlund.

"Even if He might attain greatness in the future, He still has to listen
to mom now, studying hard, and improving every day..." Franca muttered,
purposely making a detour to Quartier de l'Observatoire. At the entrance
of an apartment, she saw Jenna's brother, Julien, and Ms. Bella,
formerly of the Moss Ascetic Order. Julien appeared confident and
ambitious, while Bella looked calm, free of past worries.

They had married and chosen to settle in Suhit. This time, they returned
to Trier specifically for the wedding, with Jenna attending in person to
offer her congratulations.

After ensuring Julien and Bella boarded a carriage to the steam
locomotive station, Franca breathed a sigh of relief and continued her
aimless wandering, sometimes in the streets and sometimes within the
mirrors.

After some time, she returned to the market district, where she saw Rue
Anarchie and Auberge du Coq Doré.

Smiling, Franca entered and skillfully made her way to the basement bar,
ordering a glass of absinthe with a dreamy green hue.

Wearing her cap, she took a sip and shook her head in distaste.

This drink never tasted good!

"The landlord of Auberge du Coq Doré changed again?" she casually asked
the bar owner, Pavard Neeson.

Without looking up, the ponytailed Pavard Neil replied, "Yeah, I heard
some tycoon bought up the entire street's properties. But he promised
not to change Auberge du Coq Doré, just maybe renovate it."

"What's his name?" Franca curiously asked without performing any
divination.

Pavard Neeson thought for a moment. "His name is... Danitz, I think."

Danitz? Mr. Fool's oracle? Already a Sequence 4 Iron-Blooded Knight, and
he's still interested in buying property? And he happened to purchase a
building once occupied by the highest existence of the Red Priest
pathway... Isn't this another example of the Law of Beyonder
Characteristics Convergence? Franca's spiritual intuition quickly
confirmed it, and she found it somewhat amusing.

Suddenly, a commotion sounded behind her.

Turning slightly, she saw a young man in a white shirt and open black
vest, holding a beer and leaping onto a small round table, cheerfully
addressing the crowd, "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm back!

"Though I stayed in Suhit, got another promotion and raise, and became a
true middle-class, civilized man, my return to Trier only raised my rank
by one, but still---I'm back!

"Don't you want to know why?

"Because this is the Trier that we both hate and love!

"Cheers!"

By the afternoon, Franca returned to the villa where she lived.

It was time for the monthly Tarot Club's Divine Council.

Soon, her figure appeared above the gray fog, seated beside Madam
Temperance, Sharron.

She held The Empress card.

Madam Justice, Mr. Hanged Man, Madam Magician, Mr. Sun, Madam Judgment,
Mr. Star, Ma'am Hermit, and Mr. Moon were all present.

Lord of Mysteries Klein, sat at the head shrouded in gray fog, with
slimy tentacles briefly flickering in the fog behind him.

Madam Justice stood first, curtsying politely.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Fool\~"

The formal members of the Tarot Club were still most comfortable
addressing him this way.

After the greetings, The Magician Fors sat down and awkwardly glanced at
the end of the long bronze table.

"Mr. Fool, there isn't much to report this month; we've mainly been on
interstellar travels."

Lord of Mysteries Klein leaned back in his chair, chuckled softly, and
said calmly, "Then tell me about your travels."

He added, "In detail."

Madam Magician Fors carefully said, "This time, we went to Planet
Lorbath, where we even encountered the God of Steam and Machinery. He
was quite interested in the local knowledge and technology..."

Seeing Mr. Fool listening intently, The Magician Fors relaxed and spoke
more thoroughly.

With additional details from Mr. Hanged Man Alger, The Empress Franca,
and others, the vivid retelling of the trip made Justice Audrey and The
Star Leonard, who missed it, feel as though they had been there---and
regret it even more.

Klein quietly listened with a faint smile, never interrupting.

After the Tarot Gathering ended and she returned to reality, Franca
walked towards the full-length mirror in the master bedroom.

Relaxed, she stepped through the mirror, plunging into a strange
sensation of rapid descent, arriving on a desolate, lifeless planet.

A thin fog emerged before her.

She walked into it.

What met her eyes was an ancient city.

There were skyscrapers, speeding cars, airplanes piercing through
clouds, and pedestrians holding cell phones.

Suddenly, two blinding headlights flashed towards her, nearly blinding
her.

A rideshare car stopped in front of her.

Franca opened the door and sat in the back seat, complaining to the
driver with a monocle on his right eye, "Can't you turn off the high
beams?"

The driver pointed to the golden sun ornament on the dashboard and
smiled. "Ever since I stole it, I can't turn them off."

Franca said nothing more, admiring the city streets of the past pass by
while in the car. There were many buildings from Trier.

Eventually, her spiritual intuition drew her gaze to the screen inside
the car.

A beautiful yet pure-looking woman on the screen excitedly announced,
"Citizens, I am your Mayor Cheek. My next plan is to eliminate traffic
lights and crosswalks..."

Before She finished, the screen distorted with harsh static.

When the picture returned, Mayor Cheek solemnly said, "Ha, that was a
joke. Now, onto the main topic."

Franca clicked her tongue, turning back to the window.

Outside stood a Trier-style cathedral, bustling with people.

Through the window and mirror, Franca saw a man at the altar---blood-red
hair, blood-stained black robe, handsome and masculine but not
sharp---it was Alista Tudor.

He was the priest of this cathedral.

The vehicle continued forward and soon arrived at a vast square.

In the middle of the square stood a peculiar statue. It resembled a
vortex, yet its color was indescribable, as if it encompassed all
possibilities.

The vehicle kept driving until it reached the edge of the city.

There, a village appeared with lush green pastures and a gently flowing
stream.

Franca got out of the car and casually waved at a girl herding geese by
the river and the young man beside her, serving as a greeting.

Like returning home, she naturally followed the country road into the
village. In the distance, she saw a towering earthen pillar several
dozen meters high. At its peak sat a figure with three heads and six
arms, quietly enduring the wind and rain, basking in the sun and storms.

Franca headed straight to Ol' Tavern and, unsurprisingly, found Lumian
sitting at the bar in his white shirt and black vest. A glass of La Fée
Verte sat by his hand, while Jenna, dressed in a light, flowing dress,
passionately sang lively songs for the farmers and their wives in the
middle of the tavern.

A smile spread across Franca's face as she watched Jenna perform. She
strolled to the bar and sat beside Lumian.

"One glass of Kirsch." She snapped her fingers at the bartender, then
turned to Lumian and asked, "Where's Aurore?"

Lumian, with his blood-red hair, chuckled and said, "At home, writing
travel notes."

Franca let out an "oh" and happily said to Lumian, "I'm planning to stay
in the Western Continent for a while soon. Aurore already agreed to come
along. Want to join us?"

"Sure," Lumian turned slightly, smiling as he gestured toward the center
of the tavern. "You can ask Jenna yourself if she wants to go."

Franca followed his gaze just in time to see Jenna finishing the last
few lines of her song. With a bright smile, Jenna extended an inviting
hand toward both Franca and Lumian.

Her cheerful singing echoed throughout the entire tavern.

"As long as Trier endures, mirth and glee will never falter!"
