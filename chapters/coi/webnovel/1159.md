## Chapter 1159: Oath of the River Styx

As the crimson meteor descended, the entire world outside the protected
zones erupted in flames. Across the cosmos, catastrophic disasters
across various star systems momentarily froze before either intensifying
or subsiding.

Behind the Great Old Dominators attacking the astral barrier, hand-drawn
black holes and their accretion disks materialized. The energy seas,
depicted like paintings, quickly receded, plunging into cold, deathly
silence.

Numerous calamities descended upon this place.

These calamities were deliberately engineered by Lumian as symbolic
manifestations triggered during his full accommodation of the City of
Calamity and his advancement to the Origins of Disaster, Calamity of
Destruction.

He harbored no illusions that these indiscriminate calamities could
seriously harm the Great Old Dominators. His sole aim was to sow chaos,
giving Mr. Fool a brief respite.

At that moment, the sound of plucked strings suddenly resonated. The
black hole and its accretion disk, already like hand-drawn
illustrations, grew thinner and smaller, losing their conceptual weight.

The black hole, now a true painting, instinctively tore at the
dimensions bearing it, attempting to absorb them within and alter the
current state.

A massive, terrifying mouth abruptly appeared, biting down on the
"canvas" carrying the black hole and devouring it whole.

Multiple abstract stomachs emerged, expanding and contracting as they
fiercely struggled against the undigested entities.

Primordial Hunger, the symbol of devouring, an insatiable convergence,
the cleanser of all things!

Other Outer Deities also took measures to suppress the calamities
erupting behind Them.

Meanwhile, the crimson meteor was swallowed by the muddy radiance
emanating from the blood-red moon.

The ocean of bloodstained light alternated between destruction and
rebirth, gradually slowing the meteor's approach toward the colossal
figure.

However, beyond this sea of blood, everything else was set aflame by the
crimson meteor. Even the moonlight that once illuminated the Western
Continent was burned away, vanishing completely.

Seizing this opportunity---taking advantage of the brief chaos among the
Great Old Dominators and the reduced pressure on the illusory
barrier---the Lord of Mysteries, Klein, sent forth a projection of
himself and turned his gaze toward the protected zones.

Within the protected zone, Trier remained tranquil. On the terrace,
Queen Mystic Bernadette had already taken out her crown adorned with
dark gemstones, holding it in both hands.

The crown abruptly flew into the air, leaving the protected zone and
ascending into the skies over the Western Continent.

Accompanying it were the brass-bound book descending from above the gray
fog and two beams of light, one from behind the cross and the other from
within the protected zone.

In the blink of an eye, they arrived before the magnificent stone door
standing amidst the clouds, falling into the hands of a towering figure
crowned with an emperor's diadem and veiled by cascading tassels.

The figure nodded toward the astral world before turning away, returning
to the summit of the thirty-three heavens and seating Himself on the
throne of the Celestial Thearch.

He immediately placed the crown adorned with dark gemstones atop His
head, overlapping it with the emperor's crown.

His hands clutched the brass-bound book tightly, while the two beams of
light spiraled for a second before merging into His body.

Within the protected zone, the disappearance of the Black Emperor's
Uniqueness prompted Queen Mystic Bernadette to let out a soft sigh.

This had been one of Klein's true purposes when Lumian visited her with
a prophecy as an excuse.

Through the Genie's description of the urgency of the situation and His
suggestion to temporarily strengthen the Nation of Disorder, Queen
Mystic Bernadette immediately understood Mr. Fool's intent.

He intended to borrow the Black Emperor Uniqueness.

At that moment, Bernadette had already made her decision.

Behind her, the figure of Empress Roselle, wearing a luxurious golden
crown, materialized. With a complicated tone, She said, "As long as the
order and rules he established remain, he can still be resurrected."

Bernadette murmured to herself, "Can someone with the Nation of
Disorder, with all its Uniquenesses and Beyonder characteristics, truly
become a Great Old Dominator?"

"No, the Nation of Disorder's consciousness is interwoven with too many
external spirits. It's not a complete birth and remains chaotic. Even
with all its components, it cannot undergo a fundamental transformation.
It may take decades or centuries for a new, unified consciousness to
emerge, enabling the Shadow of Order to truly manifest in reality.

"The only way to instantly elevate the Nation of Disorder to the level
of a Great Old Dominator is to unseal and release Genie. However, what
Genie might do after escaping His seal is entirely unpredictable.

"For now, the Lord of Mysteries can only temporarily enhance the Nation
of Disorder to a state close to that of a Great Old One, allowing it to
play a role in the upcoming battle," Empress Roselle explained plainly.

She paused for a moment before adding, "Even if the Nation of Disorder
births a new consciousness and becomes the Shadow of Order before his
resurrection, with the Lord of Mysteries' help, he could still revive
through the rules. However, he would only be able to reclaim two
portions of the Prince of Abolition Beyonder characteristics."

Queen Mystic Bernadette turned to Empress Roselle and fell silent for a
moment before asking, "And what about you?"

A look of contentment and solace appeared on Empress Roselle's face. "If
the apocalypse passes, the mirror world should have a relatively normal
ruler. By then, the reflection world within the mirror will no longer be
dark."

Following the Lord of Storms Leodero's suicidal attack and the descent
of the Calamity of Destruction, the Mother Goddess of Depravity's
blockade over the Western Continent was completely broken.

Evernight Goddess Amanises and the God of Steam and Machinery Stiano
seized the opportunity to descend from the astral world to the Dragon
Lock Tower.

The former wore a layered yet unadorned black classical gown, Her face
shrouded in a veil, ethereal and graceful. The latter appeared as a
middle-aged man seemingly composed of numerous depictions of
civilizations, which finally coalesced into a man in his prime.

Evernight Goddess Amanises nodded at the sect master of the Haoli
lineage, communicating telepathically. *"Let us begin."*

The Haoli sect master closed His eyes, and a broad, dark, colorless
river flowed out of the void, reaching the Evernight Goddess.

Within the illusory dark waters, figures dressed like the Haoli sect
master appeared, floating and sinking. Among them, the most lucid was a
figure wearing a rusty iron crown, with pale whiskers fluttering at His
chin---the Underworld Daoist.

Evernight Goddess Amanises pointed at the silently flowing River of
Eternal Darkness and spoke with Her mind.

*"Let the River of Eternal Darkness bear witness. I, Amanises, pledge to
strengthen the Haoli lineage, ensuring all disciples achieve balance
between internal and external cultivation and attain characteristics.
Should I break this oath, I shall suffer a backlash from the sefirah,
and I shall sink eternally to the river's depths!"*

Having already reached an agreement, the Underworld Daoist nodded
slightly. He extended His pale right hand, with a texture like jade yet
marred by cracks oozing yellow pus or sprouting white feathers, and
placed it atop the Evernight Goddess's head.

*"You shall be sect master!"*

With these words, streams of radiance rose from the River of Eternal
Darkness, weaving into complex, orderly symbols that entered Amanises's
body.

Amanises found Herself standing in the broad, dark river, where the
shadows and bones of past Haoli sect masters gnawed at Her arms, back,
and soul.

Already in partial control of a tributary of the River of Eternal
Darkness, Amanises remained calm, resisting the chaotic consciousness
infused with the spirits of countless Dao integrators.

The straight, illusory river flowed through Her body and emerged from
the other side.

God of Steam and Machinery Stiano sat cross-legged before the Celestial
Master. The latter's intent echoed in His mind:

*"You have two choices:*

*"First, acknowledge me as your master and join my sect. I will grant
you the Supreme Clarity Talisman and pass down the position of Celestial
Master to you, allowing you to control what you call the Knowledge Moor.
However, this carries a risk..."*

As the intent reverberated, silhouettes began to emerge in the moor
behind the Celestial Master. They were dressed in feathered robes and
high crowns, their faces either hideous or decayed, exuding intense
malice.

*"They are the Celestial Masters and accomplished cultivators of past
generations.*

*"Under the influence of the Unborn Ancient Mother every Celestial
Master since the first Celestial Master's integration with the Dao must
possess corresponding bloodlines and complete cultivation.*

*"You lack these. Through the Supreme Clarity Talisman, I can help you
accommodate the Knowledge Moor in a short time. But afterward, you will
face backlash. Whether you can endure and resolve the resentment of past
Celestial Masters and accomplished cultivators or avoid being drawn into
the moor to become one of the wandering spirits---I do not
know.*

*"The second choice is to acknowledge me as your master and join my
sect. I will grant you the Three Caverns and Five Thunders
Talisman.*

*"After corresponding with Fellow Daoist Zhou, I have improved the Three
Sovereigns Calamity Dispelling Formation based on the experiences of
predecessors. With this, you can join me as a true disciple in powering
the formation. You will lend me your power , allowing me to integrate
with the Dao briefly to combat the vile demons from beyond."*

In an instant, the Celestial Master's thoughts were fully understood by
God of Steam and Machinery Stiano through the infusion of knowledge.

In the same manner, Stiano conveyed His question: *"Can either method
result in the emergence of a temporary Great Old One?"*

The Celestial Master, holding His horsetail whisk, shook His head.

*"Neither. We both still lack time. Unlike the new master of the Haoli
lineage, you have not yet preemptively gained partial control of the
Dao.*

*"These two choices can only bring us close to the Dao, not fully
integrate into it."*

Knowing time was pressing, God of Steam and Machinery Stiano deliberated
briefly before kneeling to give His answer: *"I am willing to
acknowledge you as my master and become part of the formation."*

The Celestial Master seemed disappointed, as though His hoped-for
liberation had not been achieved.

He pressed His horsetail whisk against Stiano's shoulder.

*"In the interest of urgency, we will simplify the rites to granting a
title and talisman.*

*"From this day forth, your Dao name shall be:*

*"True Blessing."*
