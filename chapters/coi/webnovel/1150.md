## Chapter 1150: Mysteries

As Lumian rose to his feet, Earth Mother Lilith sighed softly.

She raised Her right hand with a relaxed smile, smoothing Her dark brown
hair.

It was as if She had returned to the state when She was one of the eight
ancient gods.

Back then, She was the most beautiful woman, the most beautiful
creature, and the most beautiful deity in the entire world and universe.

Almost simultaneously, She sensed the Gift of the Land shrinking
slightly toward Her, seemingly startled, frightened, and saddened.

She also saw Mr. Fool, who was already standing, raise both hands. The
black trench coat He wore flared as if caught in a strong wind.

Fooled!

Both Lumian's and Lilith's respective symbolic connections were valid
and strong. Without needing further aid, Mr. Fool's sole task now was to
Fool the Brood Hive, ensuring It remained utterly convinced.

The next moment, Sanguine Ancestor Lilith saw the formless, colorless
flame Lumian had conjured merge with the freezing black flame, forming a
strange black fire that restrained madness, destruction, and chaos.

Fire of Destruction!

The Fire of Destruction elongated into a massive black sword, which
struck the remains of Omebella and Lilith across the distance.

Lilith offered no resistance, and neither did the Gift of the Land. It
only let out an illusory wail of sorrow.

Lilith smiled---a smile as radiant as moonlight, as tender as the earth,
and as loving as a mother's.

*Crack!*

Omebella's remains were the first to shatter. The lingering spirit and
spirituality within them were swallowed by the black flames of the Sword
of Destruction, disappearing entirely.

Pieces of broken wood were flung in all directions, charred black, with
some reduced to ash.

Lilith's expression twisted uncontrollably, a reflection of the
instinctive pain She felt.

Her voluptuous, graceful body split open, crumbling into fragments of
brown light that scattered across the sky.

Her immense vitality struggled to reassemble the fragments, but it
couldn't overcome the symbolic forces of destruction and chaos.

Within two or three seconds, the orbs of brown light fell to the grand
palace's floor.

Lilith's consciousness rapidly dissipated. The final image in Her vision
was of Mr. Fool and Lumian bowing slightly to Her in unison.

She smiled again.

Outside the protected zone, at the astral barrier, under the influence
of the symbolic connection of falsehood becoming truth, the dormant body
of Earth Mother Lilith also began to collapse, consumed by black flames
that annihilated all and returned everything to the primordial.

A crimson moon once again rose high in the World of Ruins, accompanied
by a mass of brown soil sprouting grass, grains, trees, mushrooms, and
numerous reproductive organs.

Earth Mother Lilith, the ancestor of the Sanguine, had fallen.

Soon, the crimson moon and the brown soil plummeted together, streaking
the sky with red and brown light as they descended into the protected
zone.

Grafting!

On the western horizon, the larger blood-red moon that had just begun to
rise through the gray fog suddenly exhibited rapid upheaval. A prominent
bulge surged upward, as if the moon's crust were violently shifting,
forming a mountain thousands or tens of thousands of meters high.

The mountain wriggled, resembling both a bird's nest and a womb.

The Brood Hive, whose dissipating consciousness had been rekindled by
intense hatred and mystical stimulation, reassembled and became active
once more.

The ascent of the enormous blood moon came to an abrupt halt, even
showing signs of sinking back into the depths of the gray fog and below
the horizon.

Sanguine Ancestor Lilith's death had not been in vain. The complete
fusion of the Mother Goddess of Depravity and the Brood Hive had indeed
been delayed!

At the astral barrier, with the Earth Mother's support gone, eight stars
of various colors---scarlet, gold, and more---suddenly flared with
extreme brilliance.

They rapidly expanded, pressing against the invisible barrier like
terrifying eyes peering inside, or gaping mouths tearing at a membranous
veil.

The sound of crackling transitioned from the abstract to the real,
resonating from the astral world into the World of Ruins.

This signified that the invisible barrier had developed deep cracks,
with mere seconds of durability remaining.

Once it shattered, the Outer Deities would tear apart the entire planet.

Among them, some deities bore symbols far less "gentle" than the Great
Mother's.

Within the protected zone.

Will Auceptin, residing in the Southern Continent, raised His head to
gaze at the night sky where the crimson moon hung high, and sighed in a
deliberately aged tone.

"What's destined to come will come..."

He still appeared as a young boy, but His hair had somehow turned
silver.

Beside Him, Azik Eggers also looked at the crimson moon in the night sky
and nodded slightly. "Death is not the true end.

"Even death itself will pass away."

At that moment, all the high-level entities within the protected zone
"heard" the warning of fate---a symphony heralding the arrival of death.

They were all powerless to stop it.

Meanwhile, in the grand palace above the gray fog, Mr. Fool Klein nodded
at Lumian and stepped forward.

He entered the astral realm, His figure growing immeasurably vast,
neither abstracted nor reduced to mere symbols.

More than a month earlier, Klein Moretti had already completed his
confrontation and fusion with The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth
for Blessings, truly accommodating Sefirah Castle!

The acceleration of Klein's progress was due to the Mother Goddess of
Depravity's actions---Her attempt to revive the Primordial God Almighty
through the mirrored Original Creator and the subsequent true birth of
Omebella.

While these moves brought immense gains to the Mother Goddess, they also
had significant drawbacks. They agitated the Celestial Worthy, who
understood the terror of the Original Creator and the hatred the
Primordial God Almighty bore toward Him. Forced to compromise, the
Celestial Worthy chose to compromise and withdraw.

Although this meant ceding the contest to Klein, the Celestial Worthy
believed that, in the grand scheme of things---over tens of thousands or
even millions of years---He would eventually triumph. However, should
the Original Creator or Primordial God Almighty return, all hope would
be lost for Him!

To hasten the Celestial Worthy's withdrawal, Klein had made some
concessions, achieving a more thorough fusion in certain aspects.

Thus, on June 25, 1360, Klein Moretti completed his confrontation and
fusion with the Celestial Worthy, accommodating Sefirah Castle as a
single-pathway deity---The Fool!

For over a month since then, the now fully awakened The Fool Klein had
refrained from immediate action, sharing his true state only with
Lumian, the Evernight Goddess, and Will Auceptin. Instead, he had
patiently and covertly prepared.

A Magician didn't perform unprepared!

Lumian's actions---visiting Red Angel Medici, retrieving 0-01, and
dealing with Primordial Demoness Cheek---had happened only at the end of
June for a critical reason:

he was awaiting Mr. Fool's full awakening!

That's why Ouroboros suddenly sensed that the opportunity had slipped
away, and that He wouldn't be able to become a deity of the Fate pathway
in the near future.

That was why the blessing granted by Will Auceptin could enable the
scene transplantation of the Box of the Great Old Ones---it was finally
the right moment. With the help of the awakened Fool Klein, He
accommodated the Die of Probability, the Uniqueness of the Fate pathway.

That's why Lumian, under the guise of seeking divination, visited the
God of Knowledge and Wisdom and Queen Mystic on behalf of Mr. Fool.

Klein and Lumian's original plan was that once the latter accommodated
the City of Calamity, he would leverage symbolic connections to kill
Earth Mother Lilith. During the fierce confrontation between the Brood
Hive and the Mother Goddess of Depravity, Klein would enter the astral
world, retrieve the Uniquenesses of Error and Door, along with their
corresponding Sequence 1 characteristics, and truly transcend the
Sequences to become the Lord of Mysteries. As a Pillar, he would replace
Earth Mother Lilith in maintaining the astral barrier.

This approach would ensure the barrier's stability for at least another
three to five years. That was why Klein had chosen not to ascend as the
Lord of Mysteries at that time to directly confront the Mother Goddess
of Depravity. If he had taken back the Uniquenesses linked to Gehrman
Sparrow, the barrier would have collapsed within three seconds, even if
Earth Mother Lilith hadn't yet fallen.

Simultaneously, the Lord of Mysteries Klein could remotely assist
Lumian---now the Origins of Disaster---against the Mother Goddess of
Depravity, who would be suffering a backlash from the Brood Hive. This
greatly increased their chances of victory. With the barrier stabilized,
the battle would no longer have a time constraint.

Once the Mother Goddess of Depravity was driven from within the barrier,
Lord of Mysteries Klein could lift the seals and aid the birth of more
Above the Sequences. With him present, the deities could take turns
leaving the astral barrier without fear of its collapse.

However, to stabilize Lumian and prevent him from exploding
uncontrollably as a Great Old Dominator after accommodating the City of
Calamity, The Fool Klein chose to wait another month. This caused them
to miss the optimal opportunity---though it might not have been optimal
and could very well have been the worst possible time.

Since the best timing was no longer available, they now had to act
quickly and give Lumian a chance to accommodate the City of Calamity
before the Mother Goddess of Depravity fully accommodated the Brood
Hive!

At the astral barrier, the figure of Gehrman Sparrow, who had been
waiting, emerged. With his star-encrusted cane and black gloves, he
stepped in front of The Fool Klein.

His expression cold, he revealed a faint smile, took a step forward, and
merged with The Fool Klein's figure.

The two became one!

The Fool Klein's body abruptly collapsed inward. Within the depths of
his black trench coat, a glowing bluish-black door seemed to flicker in
and out of existence.

The star-encrusted cane and black gloves collapsed inward as well,
forming a massive vortex within the trench coat---a terrifying vortex.

Every gust of wind, droplet of water, and ray of light in the vortex
consisted of writhing worms, segmented insects, and tiny, starlit
creatures.

Within a second or two, the vortex was also devoured. The inside of the
black trench coat became an abyss, seemingly infinite, as if it
contained an entire universe and a spirit world connected to every
planet.

As this transformation occurred, grayish-white fog rapidly spread
throughout the World of Ruins, enveloping the entire planet and all
living beings.

Beyond the barrier, in the boundless universe, faint gray fog began to
spread as well, though no one could say when it had started.

Living beings within the fog either became dull-witted, filled with
cunning, or inexplicably transported to the place they knew most
intimately.

Numerous rules malfunctioned, and many symbols were fooled.

The pressure from the Outer Deities momentarily stagnated.

Time stopped.

At the astral barrier, within the darkness inside the black trench coat,
smooth tentacles inscribed with mysterious patterns suddenly emerged.
They slipped into black gloves at the sleeves and lifted the
star-encrusted cane.

Next, under the silk half top hat, a face slowly emerged from the
darkness---a face with black hair and brown eyes.

It was Klein Moretti's face.

The Lord of Mysteries was born.

The ruler of the spirit world had returned.
