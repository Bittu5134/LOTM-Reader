## Chapter 389: Suspected God

In the uninhabited quarry cave beneath Trier.

Hela observed as the transparent and distorted maggots perished, yet she
didn't detect any Beyonder characteristics emerging.

She turned her attention to Lumian and Franca, who were sound asleep.
Satisfied that they had regained control thanks to the night and their
dreams, and their breathing had steadied, she ended her forced slumber.

Two seconds later, Lumian's eyes shot open, and he leaped up with the
agility of a leopard.

In an instant, he summoned three crimson flames that illuminated the
cavern.

As he kept a vigilant watch over his surroundings, Franca, still
recovering from severe mental injuries, rubbed her head and slowly got
to her feet, fear in her eyes.

Then, she spotted Hela in her distinctive black widow-like dress and the
familiar bonnet with a veil. She blurted out, "Madame Hela, what brings
you here?"

Instant regret washed over her. She had inadvertently revealed her
affiliation with the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society.

If she hadn't spoken, she could have pretended to be nothing more than a
friend of Ciel---that she wasn't Hidden Blade.

"Hidden Blade?" Hela inquired.

Franca let out a dry laugh.

"Yes, how did you recognize me?"

"You're the only Demoness in the Research Society," Hela replied calmly.

Franca felt even more embarrassed and replied ridiculously, "I
recognized you based on your attire and demeanor. You never showed your
face at the gatherings."

As the two acknowledged each other, Lumian's wariness visibly eased.
With Madame Hela's presence, he felt his safety was assured.

Then, he noticed the two marionettes lying lifeless on the ground,
surrounded by a pool of flesh infested with translucent maggots.

"Is that Loki?" Lumian pointed at the grotesque, horrifying mass.

Hela cast her gaze over.

"Yes."

Lumian fell silent for a moment before asking, "Is he dead?"

Hela nodded slightly and said, "He succumbed to his own loss of control,
but it's not a complete demise."

"Huh?" Franca asked in confusion.

Look at how badly minced he is. Maggots are crawling out, but he's not
completely dead?

She had already figured out why Madame Hela had appeared. Ciel, that
scoundrel, must have used her as bait again and written a letter to
Madame Hela to clean up the mess!

Hela looked at Lumian and said coldly, "High-level Demonesses aren't the
only ones capable of resurrection; high-level Seers can do it too. Loki
likely worships an evil god in this domain. Combined with his
uniqueness, he can abandon his body upon death and revive in a
pre-prepared location with his characteristics intact.

"Unfortunately, I didn't foresee this. If I had prayed for true
Concealment in advance, he wouldn't have been able to revive, and he'd
leave behind his Beyonder traits."

The woman calmly recounted her oversights, offering no excuses and
showing no frustration.

Lumian's eyes remained fixed on the grotesque mass of flesh infested
with dead maggots, a slow smile spreading across his face.

The corners of his mouth curled upward as he remarked, "Not bad at all.
If he were to meet his end like this, I'd be disappointed. How can I not
be the one to kill him with my own hands?"

As Lumian spoke, a burning desire for High-Sequence Beyonder powers
ignited within him.

Loki was undeniably formidable. Even when he and Franca had joined
forces, Loki had come dangerously close to turning Lumian into a
marionette. Yet, Hela, suspected to have advanced to Sequence 4, had
effortlessly dispatched him in less than ten seconds.

Lumian understood that unleashing the Blood Emperor aura would
undoubtedly draw the attention of official Beyonders from the market
district, possibly prompting them to seek assistance from the Churches'
Saints. Therefore, after Hela had sought him out, she had to subdue Loki
and relocate him within ten seconds. Otherwise, the chance of being
intercepted by Trier's Saints and Angels was exceedingly high.

This was what a demigod was like!

Lumian eagerly looked forward to summarizing more Pyromaniac acting
principles and digesting the potion over the next two to three months.
His goal was to attempt an advancement to Conspirer. He recollected his
plans for revenge against Loki and the others, the eradication of
heretics, and his insatiable thirst for mystical, high-end powers.

Seeing Lumian's lack of regret or disappointment, replaced instead by an
unwavering fighting spirit, Hela subtly nodded in approval.

Lumian's gaze remained fixed on Loki's corpse.

"Which evil god does he worship?"

Franca's heart skipped a beat at this question. She turned to Hela and
asked, "Could it be..."

The Demoness of Pleasure paused briefly before switching to a
complicated language that Lumian couldn't understand.

"The Immortal Lord..."

Hela abruptly cut her off.

"Have you forgotten that I don't understand that language either?"

"Uh..." Franca couldn't help but slap her forehead.

*My pig brain!*

Hela continued, "Speak in ancient Feysac or Intisian. Also, remember,
pause after each line and tell me something else."

Franca quickly acknowledged her instructions, organized her thoughts,
and began speaking in ancient Feysac.

"The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth for Blessings..."

Hela interrupted her once again and engaged in a brief discussion about
Loki's assault.

Franca continued, "The Sky Lord of Heaven and Earth for Blessings..."

Lumian, paying close attention, began to grasp the purpose of Madame
Hela's request.

It was a precaution to prevent Franca from reciting the evil god's full
honorific name and potentially attracting unwanted attention.

"The Exalted Thearch of Heaven and Earth for Blessings..." Franca
repeated the third line and massaged her temples. "When I heard Loki
recite it, it felt like I had been transported to another world.
Everything was shrouded in fog, and I couldn't discern anything clearly.
My thoughts slowed to a crawl. I vaguely recall that there should be
another phrase."

Hela chimed in with her own addition in ancient Feysac, "The Celestial
Worthy. Of Heaven and Earth. For Blessings."

This time, she even paused the simple line twice.

Lumian couldn't help but express his confusion. "This name has a rather
odd style."

It differed significantly from the honorific names of deities like Mr.
Fool, the Eternal Blazing Sun, and others he was familiar with. The
format and words gave off the impression of belonging to a distinct
civilization.

Franca furrowed her brow in thought.

"Now that you mention it, I recall something."

Lumian inquired, "What is it?"

Franca was about to speak but then abruptly closed her mouth.

She looked at Hela with a sheepish smile.

"Do you mind if I assisted Ciel in infiltrating the Research Society to
investigate the April Fool's team?"

"He had my approval," Hela replied calmly.

Franca maintained her "submissive" smile.

"Then, would you mind if I had shared the secret of our transmigration
with Ciel?"

Hela fell silent for a few moments before responding, "Does it matter if
I mind now? Should I Conceal both of you?"

Franca suddenly realized that this situation might not be entirely
negative and hastily explained, "You see, the April Fool's team is under
suspicion for Muggle's death, and there's no way around revealing our
secret when investigating them. That's why I told Ciel about it.
Besides, Ciel has genuinely helped us find clues related to
transmigration and the possibility of returning to our world!"

She wore an expression as if she had already made up for her mistake.

"What clues?" Hela blurted out for the first time.

Franca exhaled and said, "This is somewhat complex. Let me start by
recalling what those honorific names reminded me of.

"We've been communicating, trying to find commonalities and similarities
in what each of us did before transmigration to uncover the reason. Some
received mysterious phones, others entered abandoned ancient temples in
the mountains, and some were studying folklore culture. But I can't
pinpoint what I did that led to it. It's not that I can't remember, but
I've done so much.

"As you all know, I enjoy novelty. I buy new phones, play new games, try
out new restaurants, and even create clothing and cosplay at major
conventions. I engaged in a multitude of activities before
transmigrating, making it difficult to determine which one triggered the
transmigration.

"However, when I heard the honorific name Loki recited, I recalled that
on that particular night, I had played a new video game called 'Terror
Attack.' In the game, there was a hidden monster that had faith in
something called the 'Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth.'"

Though Lumian didn't comprehend the concept of a "video game," he
grasped the essence of Franca's explanation.

Her transmigration in this world appeared to be connected to the
Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings, whom Loki worshiped!

Hela, her light-blond hair flowing naturally over her shoulders,
listened attentively and contemplated for a moment before speaking, "I
don't have similar recollections. As I mentioned earlier, before
transmigrating, I delved into non-mainstream mythological books. There
was a deity skilled in deception and pranks who bore a striking
resemblance to Loki..."

Franca's eyes gleamed with insight as she ventured a hypothesis.

"Could Loki have transmigrated by reciting the four lines of the
honorific name? So, upon his arrival in this world, he recollected his
actions from that time and attempted to recreate them, forging a
connection with that evil god?

"Yes, he spoke vaguely when discussing such matters. The members of the
April Fool's team shared a similar experience...

"Could it be that we were all brought here by the Celestial Worthy of
Heaven and Earth for Blessings? Or did He summon us to this world?

"He's highly suspicious!"

Hela contemplated this for a moment and nodded slightly.

"At our next gathering, we can revisit this topic and communicate with
others with a clearer focus."

Franca was taken aback.

"Will the members of the April Fool's team still attend?"

"The problematic ones probably won't," Hela replied calmly. "Even if we
hastily arrange a gathering now, we'd have to notify them individually.
This period of time is sufficient for Loki to revive and alert his
associates."

Lumian raised his eyebrows.

"Why does everyone need to be notified individually? Just invite the
April Fool's team to an emergency meeting. They won't know if others
will attend. It won't take long to inform a dozen of them."
