## Chapter 859: "Ingenious" Plan

After Franca vented her anger and lay back down, Lumian finally asked,
"What were you saying earlier?"

Franca glanced at the curtained bedroom window, making it clear: *Check
if the Demoness of Black is watching!*

Lumian replied casually, "We're inside a Bottle of Fiction."

"..." Franca blinked. "When did that happen?"

"When I closed the door. I didn't want to disturb the neighbors," Lumian
answered earnestly.

"..." Franca felt another surge of anger. She snapped, "You still need
to check! What if the Demoness of Black can penetrate the Bottle of
Fiction without you noticing?"

"Yes, yes." Lumian admitted his fault and took out the Black Tear
headpiece from his Traveler's Bag, quickly sensing for a few seconds
before putting it back.

Franca finally relaxed and nodded in satisfaction. "The thing is, Mr.
Star gave me another task. He said, in addition to the Affliction potion
formula and the materials, there will be a special reward."

"What task?" Lumian asked cooperatively.

Franca looked puzzled and said, "To get some water from the Samaritan
Woman's Spring."

Lumian's first reaction was to consider the purpose of the task, but he
quickly remembered that Franca had said Mr. Star was likely a
high-ranking Red Glove from the Church of Evernight, and the Underworld
Daoist who could grant others Beyonder powers from the Darkness pathway.

"It's understandable that Mr. Star, or rather the Church of Evernight
behind him, needs water from the Samaritan Woman's Spring. But this task
is too simple for us right now. And yet he wants to give you a special
reward. Doesn't that seem a bit strange?" Lumian pondered aloud.

Franca thought for a moment and spoke, "I agree. It feels like he
designed this task just to give me the special reward. It doesn't make
sense. We've only met once."

Compared to other Demonesses in the Demoness Sect, one of Franca's
greatest strengths was not assuming that every man she met would be
infatuated with her or want to please her.

Lumian considered for a few seconds and said, "Maybe that special reward
will bring a lot of trouble. It also represents something Mr. Star truly
wants you to do."

Franca nodded in understanding. "Free rewards are the most expensive.
What appears 'free' often comes with hidden costs."

Understanding this, she felt less worried.

She thought the potential problems with the special reward, even if they
brought significant trouble, should be something she and her companions
could handle. Otherwise, the Major Arcana card holders wouldn't make
such a choice.

She then turned to Lumian and asked, "How's your collection of the
supplementary ingredients going?"

This should have been a daily concern, but hadn't she been feeling
uncomfortable every time she saw Lumian these past few days?

Lumian reflected for a moment before answering, "I found a large
battlefield from the war a few years ago and got a bag of blood-stained
soil."

"I thought you'd go to the camp where Anthony and his comrades were
attacked," Franca teased.

Lumian responded with amusement, "Am I that much of a devil? Besides,
that's not a large battlefield and might be polluted by an evil god's
worship."

Franca concurred succinctly, "What about the others?"

"I confirmed that there's active lava at the bottom of the volcano on
Saint Tick Island, but it's unnecessary to collect it now. It will
solidify quickly in the Traveler's Bag. I'll teleport it when it's
needed." Lumian had been using his teleportation ability to travel
around the world these days. "I plan to make the powder of plants and
trees polluted by the Stone of Catastrophe myself."

As for acorns, that was too simple.

"Make it yourself?" Franca was surprised. "Is that possible?"

"It should be theoretically feasible. Certain parts of a Beyonder
creature can replace such supplementary ingredients. And I have the
Sword of Courage. I can place it and its companions on a pile of plants
and trees, monitoring and replacing consumables. In about a few days, I
should be able to create polluted plants and trees. Of course, this
pollution will be more complex and severe than simple Stone of
Catastrophe pollution. I'll consult Madam Magician in advance to see if
the amount should be reduced."

"Indeed," Franca's eyes brightened, then dimmed slightly. "But the
Plague Mother Serpent bile and Silver Hunter's fragments for the
supplementary ingredients of the Demoness of Despair can't be made by
the Black Tear."

"No rush. Jenna hasn't fully digested the Pleasure potion yet. It will
take a few more days or even a week or two to become a Demoness of
Affliction." Lumian thought and said, "I have collected the blood of
seven different plague victims."

Although there was no widespread plague at the moment, many places on
the Northern and Southern Continents had sporadic outbreaks. They were
either quickly contained or limited to small, isolated areas without
spreading.

With the Magic Mirror Divination of the two Demonesses, Lumian
pinpointed eight or nine similar locations, then teleported there with
Lugano.

If the authorities had already noticed the outbreak and were working to
control it, he would leave after collecting the blood of the plague
victims. If the plague was still quietly spreading, he would attempt to
heal it with Lugano's help. If it couldn't be solved, he would find a
way to inform the authorities.

After these few days of hard work, Lumian had basically achieved his
goals.

Franca breathed a sigh of relief, stating, "Remember to use the Black
Tear to deliver the potion formula and all the materials Mr. Star gave
to Amandina.

"Sigh... When will I completely digest the Affliction potion?"

Although her current digestion progress could be considered very fast,
she still felt it wasn't enough. The person next to her was just one
step away from the final domestication step, ready to hold the ceremony
and become a Sequence 4 demigod.

Lumian turned his head to Franca and laughed.

"I just told you, you're still lacking in the part about causing others
pain. And the target should be of high Sequence, otherwise, it has to be
replaced with numbers."

Franca didn't link it to her own pain this time and started thinking
seriously.

*Causing others pain, high Sequence... Causing others pain, high
Sequence...*

Muttering to herself, Franca suddenly turned her head, her eyes shining
brightly at Lumian.

Lumian's smile faded as he raised an eyebrow and asked, "Do you have a
bold idea?"

Franca chuckled. "You have a false Angel rank. If I can make you feel
pain, wouldn't the digestion speed be incredibly fast?"

"But it has to be real pain." Lumian didn't dismiss Franca's suggestion
outright.

"For example, castration?" Franca glanced at the blanket with a growing
smile.

Lumian fell silent for a moment before responding, "We can try."

"Wait, you're actually agreeing?" Franca was startled. She had only been
joking with the suggestion of "castration."

"If it can really help you quickly digest the Affliction potion." Lumian
shrugged. "It can grow back anyway."

"Forget it, that's too painful. It would leave you with serious
psychological trauma and issues." Franca said, ruffling her tousled
hair.

Suddenly, her eyes lit up. "I have a better plan. An ingenious plan!"

Lumian felt uneasy, sensing that Franca's new plan might be even harder
to endure than "castration."

Franca's smile turned wicked.

"I thought of that Julie from the castration, and her digestion method.
She would seize the moment when the target was about to reach ultimate
satisfaction, then cut it off, plunging them from extreme pleasure into
extreme pain.

"I can be gentler, not cutting it off, but preventing you from reaching
ultimate satisfaction. Let you yearn and suffer without fulfillment,
which is also a kind of intense pain..."

Lumian raised an eyebrow, unable to speak.

Franca's smile grew more sinister, having found a prank to pull.

"For this, I need to bind you with the Demoness's spider silk, prepare
more tools, and to enhance the stimulation, you need to use your Ascetic
abilities to refrain from burning the silk...

"Although it won't compare to Julie's method, your false Angel rank
should help me digest it quickly."

Saying this, Franca clicked her tongue. "I never thought I'd do
something like this, and be the one doing the tormenting."

In the past, Lumian might have lacked a concrete concept of this pain,
but after experiencing the two Demonesses, he could now imagine how
unbearable that torment would be.

"This is the hell of pain." Lumian couldn't help but sigh.

"That's the Demoness, bringing pleasure and pain," Franca said with a
smile.

Lumian jumped out of bed and picked up his clothes.

"Eh?" Franca looked puzzled.

Lumian responded in a deep voice, "We're going to the Samaritan Woman's
Spring now."

Franca was first stunned, then burst into laughter, rolling on the bed.

She had regained her normal control over her desires after passing the
Pleasure stage, so even after being with Lumian, tasting long-lost
pleasure, and achieving unprecedented satisfaction, she still felt weird
because it was someone she knew well, who also knew her original gender.
But now, she suddenly found it amusing and interesting, making her feel
much less uncomfortable.

"Give it a try, give it a try." She lay on the bed, her eyes bright as
she continued with her prank.

Lumian sighed again.

"We'll talk after we get the water from the Samaritan Woman's Spring."

†

Beside the Samaritan Woman's Spring, shrouded in gray-white fog.

Since Lumian didn't approach and trigger any anomalies, Franca patiently
waited for a while and then used the golden vial given by Mr. Star to
collect half a vial of water from the Samaritan Woman's Spring.

They didn't bring Jenna, fearing that her encounter with Krismona's
shadow might lead to uncontrollable changes. Lumian planned to bring
Jenna here after becoming an Iron-blooded Knight with a certain level of
self-protection.

The high-ranking Major Arcana card holders seemed to dislike entering
the underground or underground catacombs. But Lumian, marked and
branded, felt that even as a demigod, he should still be able to enter
the area of the Samaritan Woman's Spring.

Not long after, Franca put away the golden vial, and the two walked
shoulder to shoulder towards the edge of the gray fog.

As they approached the edge of the fog on the slope, Lumian and Franca
simultaneously noticed a blurry figure outside the fog slowly
approaching.

Franca first darted to the side, then stared intently for two seconds.

Her expression suddenly became excited, and she said in a hushed voice
to Lumian, "Harrison!"

The visitor from Resurrection Island, Harrison!

They had failed to converge with him last time, and now they
coincidentally ran into him!
