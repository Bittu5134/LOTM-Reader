## Chapter 452: Manuscript

At noon the following day, Quartier 2, Rue Saint-Michel.

Lumian quickly realized that it was only a short distance from Rue
Saint-Varro, where the Dreamseekers charity organization was situated,
just a block and a square away.

*As expected of the arts district...* Lumian raised his brows,
feeling that he was drawing closer to the truth and edging ever closer
to the answers he sought.

He glanced away from the Sun Obelisk standing proudly in the square's
center and strolled along Rue Saint-Michel, tracing the path that winded
past the ancient and weathered buildings.

He couldn't help but notice impoverished painters hunched over their
sketchpads at the square's edge and along both sides of the street.
Musicians played their diverse tunes with guitars, violins, and flutes.
Every so often, white homing pigeons glided gracefully beside a fountain
that sent water cascading in sync with the music.

The warm autumn sun cast a poetic charm over the scene.

Having spent a considerable amount of time in the market district, often
consumed by thoughts of revenge, engrossed in investigations, or
participating in banquets, Lumian had rarely immersed himself in the
everyday life of Trier's core area.

Unfazed by the sunlight and the languid ambiance, donning a brown round
hat, a light-blue shirt, and a casual brownish-yellow suit, he made his
way into a bar named "Third-Rate Authors."

Here, most patrons sported well-worn attire, sipped affordable spirits,
and engaged in animated discussions on various subjects. Occasionally,
when inspiration struck, they'd retrieve well-thumbed notebooks and jot
down their thoughts with the fountain pens they carried.

As Lumian approached the bar counter, he couldn't help but overhear a
lively discussion among some of the patrons regarding the latest art
exhibition.

"That piece called 'Cafe' is incredibly controversial. Some people laud
it for its vibrant colors and audacious composition, seeing it as a
silent protest delivered in an absurd form. Others think it's a
deliberate attempt at abstract art, a ruse to dupe the public's
intellect."

"I find it fascinating. The artist's ideas are vividly depicted through
those overlapping colors. Just think about it. Isn't that how many cafés
are? Noisy, bustling, with people from diverse backgrounds clashing and
mingling like a chaotic blend..."

"I'm willing to call it a groundbreaking masterpiece of abstract art!"

"Are you talking about the kind of abstract art that's never been
recognized or sold?"

Lumian couldn't help but think, *Café... Isn't this the painting Mullen
created using his buttocks? Someone genuinely holds it in high regard?
Could it possibly become the most renowned and valuable work of his
life?* He pursed his lips, inwardly sighing. *You
Trierians...*

Upon reaching the bar counter, Lumian spent eight licks on a glass of
absinthe and raised his voice.

"Everyone, I have a question. If anyone can provide the answer, this
glass is on me!"

As all eyes in the bar turned towards him, Lumian spoke up:

"I'm looking for the playwright, Gabriel.

"I need him to write a script."

In Rue Saint-Michel, nearly anyone one bumped into on the road could be
an author or painter, let alone in a bar known for its literary
discussions and artistic creativity.

Gabriel had frequent meetings with fellow writers and may even host
private gatherings in his rented apartment. After all, "Lightseeker" had
seen successful screenings and was quite popular, which would bring him
significant benefits.

"He hasn't shown up for a few days. He claims he's locking himself away
to finish a story," a middle-aged man near the bar counter responded to
Lumian's inquiry with a smile. "He's probably swamped with scripts.
Would you consider other playwrights? There are several equally talented
young folks around here."

*Hasn't shown up for a few days...* Lumian furrowed his brows
momentarily before relaxing.

"How will I know if I don't give it a try? I come with plenty of
sincerity."

"Alright," the middle-aged man in the tattered formal coat murmured. "I
hope you won't be disappointed."

He led Lumian to 34 Rue Saint-Michel and climbed the stairs up to the
fifth floor, near the attic.

The outer walls and stairs had a slightly outdated but still
well-maintained appearance, and it was notably cleaner and more spacious
compared to Auberge du Coq Doré.

"This is where Gabriel resides," the bearded middle-aged man informed
Lumian, rapping on the brown wooden door of Room 503.

A muffled sound echoed, but there was no response.

"Perhaps he's out searching for food, or maybe he's completed his work
and gone to see the theater manager who commissioned it," the
middle-aged man suggested with a forced smile. "Would you like to return
to the bar for another drink? I'm an experienced writer myself, though
I've never ventured into script writing. My novels sell quite well in
the underground market."

"What have you written?" Lumian asked, glancing at the firmly closed
brown door, showing no signs of anxiety.

The middle-aged man sighed and said, "I wrote 'Monk Pursuing Dog' and
its sequel, 'Dog Pursuing Monk,' but they weren't published under my
name. For one, it would lead to my arrest by spies, and secondly, my
boss wouldn't permit it."

"A sequel?" Lumian hadn't visited an underground book market or a banned
bookstore for some time. His last visit had been to purchase "Emperor
Roselle's Secret Chronicles."

As he looked at the somewhat forlorn and slightly greasy middle-aged
man, his perspective shifted.

He could be considered one of his initiates into the adult world!

"It came out last month," the middle-aged man replied, nodding gently.
"These two novels have made my boss a fortune, but I didn't even get a
tenth of that, no, not even a hundredth!"

"Boss?" Lumian inquired, recalling that Bard, a key member of April
Fool's, had once authored "Emperor Roselle's Secret Chronicles." He saw
this as an opportunity to gain insight into the workings of this
profession and prepare for future tracking.

The middle-aged man sighed again.

"We don't have authorship rights, just writing tools for the boss. He
pays us a fixed but tiny salary for our manuscripts, specifies the
direction and requirements for our writing, and then sells them through
his own channels.

"On Rue Saint-Michel, there are many third-rate authors like me who
don't even have pen names. We're like assembly line workers."

Lumian, showing respect, asked, "May I know your name?"

The middle-aged man replied, "Rabe." His eyes were filled with hope as
he gazed at Lumian.

Lumian probed further into the world of underground literature, gaining
insight, and ultimately said, "If my attempt to reach an agreement with
Gabriel falls through, I'll consider offering you an opportunity."

Rabe's joy was palpable as he responded, "As long as the boss doesn't
assign me any new missions, you'll find me here at Third-Rate Authors
every day!"

Watching the underground author, an initiate for many Intis youths,
descend the stairs, Lumian took a wire from his pocket and unlocked
Gabriel's door.

Compared to the playwright's room at Auberge du Coq Doré, this space was
considerably more expansive, encompassing a bathroom and a small
bedroom. Beyond that, it served as a living area, study, dining room,
and kitchen. A coal stove for cooking was neatly arranged in a corner.

Lumian quickly surveyed the room and noticed a jumbled stack of papers
that resembled manuscripts on the desk by the window.

He shut the wooden door behind him and proceeded towards the desk.

*It's Gabriel's handwriting. Rabe was telling the truth. This is
definitely Gabriel's residence... *Lumian mused as he held the
stack of papers and began to peruse them.

Moving into the bedroom, he spotted a pair of black dungarees casually
draped over the bed. The sight confirmed his earlier suspicion---he was
in the right place.

This was a pair of pants Gabriel had frequently worn in the past.

However, the playwright himself was conspicuously absent.

Recalling Rabe's statement that Gabriel hadn't been seen for several
days, Lumian's caution escalated.

He meticulously examined every item in the room, much like a hunter
tracking the movements of his prey.

After a few minutes, Lumian picked up a white-glazed porcelain cup with
a single handle from the desk. He noticed that about a third of it still
held cold water, with dust floating on the surface, too subtle for
ordinary eyes to discern clearly.

*At least a day.* Lumian's heart tightened with concern.

*What could have happened to Gabriel?*

*Was it possible that his prominence had attracted the attention of
government spies seeking a "conversation"? Or perhaps he had unwittingly
become the target of money-seeking kidnappers?*

Setting the porcelain cup down beside the manuscript, Lumian
meticulously combed the room, searching for any clues or signs of
interest. His search yielded nothing of note.

Returning to the desk, he picked up the stack of manuscripts, eager to
delve into Gabriel's work before his unexplained absence.

The script told the tale of a struggling author who crossed paths with a
woman coerced into joining a criminal organization. Together, they found
solace in their shared despair, pain, torment, and the harshness of
daily life. They offered each other encouragement and warmth, ultimately
leading to the author's recognition by the newspaper's editor-in-chief
and a steady income. His reputation steadily grew, while the woman,
still trapped in her circumstances, chose to vanish.

Before the story could conclude, it ended with a passage about the
lover's disappearance and the author's introspective musings:

"She's here;

"My beloved has arrived from the night.

"She's left;

"My beloved walked towards the distant hostel..."

The mention of the word "hostel" made Lumian's forehead twitch.

Though it was an ordinary word in a script, it stood out to him due to
his daily contemplations and associations, sparking connections in his
mind.

His gaze suddenly shifted from the manuscript to the desk.

At some point, the white-glazed porcelain cup with a single handle,
which he had moved to the manuscript, had somehow returned to its
original place!

Lumian's eyes narrowed, and the muscles under his clothing tensed.

As a Hunter, he had an unwavering memory for any alterations he made in
his surroundings---it was a fundamental part of him!

*A creature that is challenging to detect with the naked eye and can
only be confirmed by certain traces.* Lumian silently
recollected the information Jenna had relayed from the authorities.

Suddenly, he reached into his pocket and retrieved a pair of glasses.

They were brown gold-rimmed glasses---Mystery Prying Glasses!
