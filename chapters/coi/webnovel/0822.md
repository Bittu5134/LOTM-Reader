## Chapter 822: Wilderness

Nikila looked at Franca with an obsession and said, "He should be
feeling the call of the wilderness."

"Wilderness?" Franca didn't hide her confusion.

Nikila eagerly and thoroughly explained, "In Fourth Epoch Trier, near
the ruined palace of Alista Tudor, beside His remains---no, on His
remains, no, under them---well, there's a wilderness there. All Mystery
Pryers and Savants will eventually return to that wilderness."

*All Mystery Pryers and Savants... The only thing powerful enough to
influence both pathways must be the Celestial Master. Professor and
Assistant Professor had dreams about the wilderness before...*
Franca perked up and asked, "What else do you know about this
wilderness?"

Nikila shook his head slightly, looking a bit annoyed but very honest.
"Nothing else. According to our leader, the higher the sequence of a
Mystery Pryer or Savant, the more likely they are to hear the call of
the wilderness."

*The Hidden Sage should stand atop the Mystery Pryer pathway, so during
the Hostel incident, when the seal of Fourth Epoch Trier was broken, the
leak of wilderness power greatly affected Him, driving Him madder. Is
Kmerolo in a similar situation? After all, he's in Trier... The demigods
of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery in Trier might also be
affected?* Franca swallowed and asked, "Has Kmerolo returned to
that wilderness?"

Nikila smiled gently but painfully.

"Not yet. He's probably just deteriorating, unable to maintain himself
well, and resisting the call in some extreme way. If he were to return,
he'd have to pass through our mirror world. It wouldn't escape our
leader's notice. If our leader knew, so would I."

*For Trier, Kmerolo returning to the wilderness might not be a bad
thing. According to Nikila---no, Griffith---Kmerolo is like a powerful
bomb that could go off at any time...* Franca thought for a
moment and asked, "Do you know where he's hiding now?"

Nikila sighed and said, "He hasn't contacted me for a while. The last
time we met was near the catacombs."

*Near the catacombs...* Franca then asked, "Griffith, what was
your goal in infiltrating the Moses Ascetic Order?"

Nikila emphasized seriously, "I am the original. Our goal was to make
the higher-ups of the Moses Ascetic Order gradually aware of the
wilderness and help us unseal Fourth Epoch Trier at a critical moment."

Franca had an epiphany and asked, "Did Kmerolo, with your 'help,'
already know about the wilderness and its exact location?"

*Was it knowing too much and possessing godhood that made Kmerolo lose
control gradually, becoming unable to resist the wilderness
call?*

*The Church of the God of Steam and Machinery hasn't shown similar
issues, at least not as severe...*

"Yes." Nikila shared his feelings with his dream lover. "So, this is
both good and bad for me. It took me a lot to gain Kmerolo's trust and
interest in the wilderness without arousing suspicion, but now all that
effort is wasted. I have to figure out how to gain the trust of another
of the Ten Pillars."

"Why is it also a good thing?" Franca was puzzled.

Nikila smiled and said, "If Kmerolo returns to the wilderness, I might
get the Mysticologist Beyonder characteristic someday."

"Mysticologist is Sequence 4 of the Mystery Pryer pathway? Can you
Mirror People ascend by drinking potions?" Franca quickly asked two
questions.

Nikila nodded. "Yes, I can ascend to Mysticologist by drinking the
potion. I am the original."

"Have you ever drunk a potion?" Franca glanced at Griffith's body, which
had not produced any Beyonder characteristics.

"No," Nikila replied candidly.

*Meh, no Beyonder characteristic drops...* Franca cursed
inwardly in pre-transmigration gaming terms and then said, "Moran Avigny
has been dead for a while. Your leader can't leave the seal and
frequently get feedback or give orders. Who's handling day-to-day
matters and contacting the Mirror People in Trier?"

"It's Palia. She received instructions and information from the leader,"
Nikila replied but didn't elaborate like before.

*The mineralogist, Jasmine, I'm tracking... No wonder she appeared twice
in Underground Trier despite being wanted... She's rebuilding the Mirror
People network in Trier?* Franca asked quickly, "Can you contact
Palia?"

Nikila shook his head again. "She contacts us one-way for now. This way,
if any one of us is exposed, it doesn't affect the others. According to
the previous arrangement, Palia contacts me through the mirror world
once a week to check on my situation and exchange new information,
usually on Sunday evenings between eight and ten."

*Don't you find this troublesome and inconvenient? Well, it is quite
safe...* Franca criticized silently and saw Nikila's image
fading, about to disappear, and quickly asked the last question,
"Besides Fourth Epoch Trier and current Trier, where else does your
mirror world connect to?"

This question came from Lumian's letter.

He confirmed Morora exchanged information with the outside world through
this special mirror world.

Nikila thought for a moment and said, "A strange place, much like Fourth
Epoch Trier, also sealed, with many living people inside, but we can't
enter."

*Mirror People can't use the special mirror world to go directly to
Morora...* Franca nodded slightly and asked, "Did some of your
companions go to Lenburg to find that sealed strange place?"

"Yes, although we can't go directly, if we can enter normally, we can
use the mirror world's power..." Nikila said as he began to lose his
soul's integrity.

He looked at Franca, lingeringly and painfully scanning her beautiful
face.

Franca's skin prickled with goosebumps.

Watching Nikila---the Mirror Person Griffith---disappear completely,
Franca sighed inwardly.

*Short-term, high-intensity, high-frequency Charm can last so long. It
might take a day or two to fade...*

*Repeated Charm in daily life, maintained long-term, can indeed make
someone fall deeply in love with me... I wonder how long this love lasts
without supernatural influence. A year should be fine, but it's hard to
say for the seven-year itch...*

*Heh, Hunters can form teams, and so can Demonesses. But the loyalty and
rapport will be higher. The only issue is team members might not truly
cooperate and could hate each other... What a mess...*

Franca put away the mirror and said to Jenna and Anthony, "No need to
wait. This guy doesn't have any Beyonder characteristics."

By then, Jenna had finished collecting the loot, getting 460 verl d'or
and nine scrolls from Nikila.

The scrolls' effects and incantations required Magic Mirror Divination
to reveal.

Anthony glanced at Nikila's body and the nine scrolls, considering.
"Should we have someone use Lie to disguise as Nikila and wait for that
Mirror Person Palia to contact?"

"We can, but it's unlikely," Franca said after some thought. "We can
bury the body and carry out anti-divination and anti-prophecy measures,
but there are many days until Sunday. The Mirror People leader might
notice something wrong. Still, it's worth a try."

After carrying out anti-divination and anti-prophecy measures and seeing
Nikila's body turn into a few broken mirror shards, Jenna frowned
slightly. "Still none of those special mirror world shards."

Moran Avigny didn't leave any either.

The shards in Jenna and Franca's possession came from Gardner Martin and
the Tamara family's crypt.

"What kind of Mirror Person leaves special mirror world shards? What's
special about the fake Martin? Next time we catch a Mirror Person, we
must ask..." Franca muttered to herself.

The three quickly tidied up the scene, and Franca activated the Ice
Amulet to teleport to the fixed mirror world entrance.

During this process, Franca used the amulet's power to send Lumian the
intelligence gathered from this operation.

†

Morora, second floor of the Carnivore bar.

Reading a book comfortably, Lumian glanced at the room's mirror, seeing
water ripple and a line of Intisian appear.

Reading it, Lumian suddenly froze.

He realized he had overlooked something.

At this moment, could the Mirror People sent to Lenburg to investigate
the whereabouts of 0-01 have infiltrated Morora?

And the Mirror People produced by the underground mausoleum's incident
could use that special mirror world unlike him!
