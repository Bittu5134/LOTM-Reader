## Chapter 1148: Farewell

Zedus emerged from the eye of Cheek's face and quietly stood behind
Lumian, expressionless and vacant-eyed.

After Lumian advanced to Red Priest, Zedus, along with the steel golems
and undead soldiers formerly belonging to 0-01, was re-enlisted into the
newly formed legion of the Red Priest. They were now stationed in a
special mirror world that had become Lumian's divine kingdom.

Seeing the Calamity of Crimson in Lumian's hand, The Sun Derrick
hesitated no longer and nodded slightly. "Okay."

"I thought you might have some reluctance," Lumian said casually.

Derrick shook his head and replied honestly, "When you first made the
request, I did feel a bit reluctant. But after returning to the New City
of Silver, I increasingly felt it was the right decision.

"When the apocalypse arrives, Mr. Fool will undoubtedly be unable to
continue protecting the New City of Silver. The Gift of the Land is the
remains of Omebella, the Great Mother's most cherished daughter. It
could likely spark an anomaly, causing unforeseen consequences and
breaking apart the protected zones from within.

"Moreover, Chief Chirmont has long since digested the Silver Knight
potion but has yet to advance to an Angel as a Glory. That's because the
Proof of Glory has to be used to seal the Gift of the Land. If it were
turned into a Beyonder characteristic, anyone using it to advance would
have to remain underground for extended periods, only leaving for short
intervals during crises.

"Replacing the Gift of the Land with the Calamity of Crimson should free
the Proof of Glory from its restraints."

Derrick, having only just become an Angel, still lacked understanding of
matters regarding the Above the Sequences.

Lumian produced a mirror and inserted the crystal tiara-shaped Calamity
of Crimson into it.

He then gently ran his hand over the mirror's surface.

After completing the task, he handed the mirror to The Sun Derrick.

"Place it in an underground location that moonlight can never reach. No
males may be within ten meters. When it needs to be used, a woman must
retrieve it.

"I've sealed the area behind the mirror and fixed an entrance to the
mirror world on its surface. Even ordinary people can extend their hand
inside to retrieve the Calamity of Crimson."

This setup mirrored how Franca had once secured a mirror world entrance
in the quarry beneath Trier by praying to the Primordial Demoness.

The Sun Derrick took the mirror and saw in its reflection the terrifying
scene of a volcanic eruption.

"Ignore any disasters reflected in the mirror," Lumian cautioned. "If
the mirror itself cracks, pray to me or Mr. Fool immediately so we can
replace its seal. As for its usage, there are three taboos: First, no
male should wield it. Second, the wielder must have godhood. Third, it
must not be used for more than three minutes, or if exposed to
moonlight, no more than thirty seconds.

"If the wielder experiences Pleasure or Charm cast by it, a new person
must take over. Otherwise, the wielder will grow increasingly obsessed
with it and try to set it free."

The Sun Derrick nodded solemnly. "I understand."

He then asked a question. "But I'm male. Is it safe for me to handle the
Calamity of Crimson?"

"For now, yes," Lumian explained. "It's still in a Conquered state and
won't 'acknowledge' anyone else. After placing the mirror underground,
avoid further contact with it."

The Sun Derrick let out a quiet sigh of relief.

"Alright. I'll head to the Twin Towers now to lift the Proof of Glory's
suppression. You can retrieve the Gift of the Land yourself."

After Lumian agreed, the newly ascended Lightseeker turned into sunlight
and flew out of the headquarters of the Church of The Fool.

Lumian remained in place, admiring the murals on the walls.

The face of Alista Tudor furrowed slightly, seemingly displeased with
the religious undertones---unless, of course, the subject of the murals
was Himself.

After some time, Cheek's face on Lumian's left shoulder turned,
revealing a stunning smile radiating maternal warmth and terrifying
allure.

In the next moment, a massive, withered, ash-brown tree trunk appeared
before Lumian.

It had been Charmed---enthralled by Cheek's face, which shared a
profound connection with it.

Two crimson flowers on the trunk, serving as its eyes, bloomed fully,
radiantly vibrant.

Lumian smiled at the Gift of the Land. "Would you like to reside in my
divine kingdom?"

The Gift of the Land moved closer without resistance.

Zedus came forward, embracing the trunk and dragging it back into
Lumian's divine kingdom---the destroyed then reformed special mirror
world.

Throughout the process, Zedus handled it roughly, yet the Gift of the
Land offered no opposition.

*The estranged siblings reunite...* Lumian chuckled softly and
disappeared from the Church of The Fool's headquarters.

___

In the World of Ruins.

Enormous oak trees stood blanketed in white by a raging blizzard, frozen
lifeless. In stark contrast, another oak grove burned fiercely, consumed
by invisible, colorless flames. Accompanying the destruction were
bird-clawed infants, various animals, and strange familiars, all reduced
to ash. Even the ground itself melted away.

At the boundary where blizzard met flames, the clash of cold and heat
created a skyward-whirling hurricane and apocalyptic torrential rain.

In the hurricane's eye, a three-headed, six-armed Lumian wandered with
frenzied, mindless eyes.

At the edge of this fog-shrouded region, Franca sat atop a nearly
100-meter-tall gray-white stone pillar, her legs dangling idly.

Having become a Demoness of Catastrophe, she could finally witness
Lumian's bouts of uncontrollable madness firsthand.

This was the twenty-ninth time she had observed it, yet it still left
her feeling low and stifled.

*My potion digested a little more... Franca mused, forcing herself to
think of something meaningful to distract from her emotions. Even though
I didn't do anything as all these catastrophes were caused by
Lumian...*

*Is it because I brought him here?*

*As a Demoness of Catastrophe, I am a bringer of calamity. Does it not
matter whether the calamities I bring are self-made or
external?*

*Right... A Demoness of Catastrophe likely serves catastrophe... Since
Lumian is the source and embodiment of catastrophes, does serving him
equate to fulfilling that role...?*

*No wonder my potion is digesting so quickly. At this rate, I'll fully
digest it in another year or two. Too bad we don't have that much
time---the one-month deadline is nearly up...*

Her thoughts wandered until the blizzard ceased, the formless and
colorless flames extinguished, and the hurricane disintegrated outward,
bending distant oaks.

Lumian, now his normal human size, approached the base of the stone
pillar, his expression weary yet faintly smiling. "Let's return to the
protected zone."

Franca smiled back and leaped gracefully from the 100-meter-high pillar,
landing as lightly as a feather.

At that moment, Lumian's middle head turned sharply, gazing toward
another oak grove untouched by the apocalyptic scene.

Franca immediately sensed the crimson moonlight deepening and
brightening.

From the depths of the grove emerged a woman dressed in a finely
tailored black corset dress with matching shoulder drape. She wore sheer
gloves that hinted at the skin beneath and a tilted, playful hat.

Around her neck hung a diamond necklace set in gold. Her eyebrows were
perfectly shaped, and her scarlet eyes shone like miniatures of the
crimson moon.

Franca had never seen a woman so beautiful---not even Cheek's face could
compare.

This beauty was pure, sublime, and awe-inspiring, making one want to
admire and protect her but not dare to approach or desecrate. In
contrast, Cheek's beauty radiated femininity and allure, stronger in
seduction but less divine.

As Franca held her breath, Lumian spoke in a low voice. "Madame Pualis,
why have you appeared here?"

Madame Pualis looked just as she had when Lumian first saw her in Cordu
Village.

*Madame Pualis... The one who birthed Omebella?!* Franca snapped
out of her daze, shaken by this realization.

She lowered her gaze, avoiding direct eye contact, and prepared to
assist Lumian with her abilities.

Madame Pualis smiled faintly. "I've come to see you both and to bid
farewell.

"I thought our last meeting would be the final one, but it seems the
Great Mother still needs more time."

"Farewell?" Lumian raised an eyebrow.

"Yes," Madame Pualis replied with a gentle smile. "I am returning to the
embrace of the Mother."

"Returning to the embrace of the Mother?" Lumian frowned. "You did all
this just for such an ending?"

In the context of the Great Mother, returning to Her embrace was
synonymous with death.

Madame Pualis spoke softly, her expression tender.

"It is what I desire. The Mother's embrace is where we came from and
where we are destined to return. There, we find peace, warmth, slumber,
and rebirth.

"Life is a journey. I have been, seen, and experienced. Naturally, it's
time to return to the Mother's embrace and await the next journey."

*That sounds utterly sinister...* Franca murmured to herself.

Lumian suddenly asked, "Are you currently a Sequence 1 Beauty Goddess of
the Moon pathway?"

"Yes, it is a gift from the Great Mother, lent to me temporarily,"
Madame Pualis said, her tone full of emotion as she spoke to Lumian and
Aurore. "The greatest regret of my journey is missing you both in Cordu
Village.

"Goodbye. We will meet again because all life will eventually return to
the Mother's embrace."

Before her words had fully settled, Cheek's face on Lumian's left
shoulder suddenly turned, Her expression sweet and smiling.

Charm!

A charm from the Demoness true god!

But Lumian was a moment too slow. Madame Pualis's figure dissolved into
crimson light, merging with the omnipresent moonlight, leaving only a
fading image of her waving hand.

"What just happened?" Franca asked warily.

Lumian's voice was low as he responded with a question,

"A Sequence 1 Beauty Goddess suddenly choosing to return to the Mother's
embrace---what does that signify?"

Franca was suddenly alarmed. "It means the Mother Goddess of Depravity
is about to fully merge with the Brood Hive and requires Sequence 1
Beyonder characteristics to support her!"

As she finished speaking, the previously devastated region began to
sprout a frenzy of vegetation. The scorched ground gave way to rapidly
growing flora, all stretching skyward.

On the western horizon, the crimson moon, blood-red and ominous, began
to rise slowly, laboriously revealing its edge.
