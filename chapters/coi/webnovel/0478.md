## Chapter 478: The Mockery of Fate

*Bang!*

The crimson fireball, unleashed from Lumian's fingertips, honed in on
its target, striking General Philip's head with deadly precision. The
explosion that followed resembled a cannonball's impact.

Philip's body disintegrated starting from the point of impact, as if a
hammer had shattered a mirror reflecting his form.

Amidst the chaos concealed by the explosion, shards of glass scattered
across the wilderness, joining the reflections of those already present.

Lumian's eyes widened as he observed the unexpected turn of events.

*Does the Deceased pathway also possess Mirror Substitution?*

*Or does General Philip wield a mystical item from the Demoness
pathway?*

Such thoughts raced through Lumian's mind as he processed the scene.
Philip's black-cloaked figure swiftly reappeared more than ten meters
away. His eyes, once frenzied, now regained clarity.

Simultaneously, Jenna, disguised as a female mercenary, materialized
from invisibility behind General Philip. She aimed her revolver at the
Deceased, who had narrowly escaped the fatal attack and negative state.

To be honest, Jenna found herself in a perplexing and shocking
situation.

The revelation that General Philip possessed Mirror Substitution didn't
catch her off guard. However, she hadn't processed the implications
before realizing he had "chosen" to position himself right before her,
as if anticipating her to backstab him.

Originally, Jenna had devised a plan to exploit Lumian's clash with
General Philip. Her intention was to utilize Invisibility, slip away
from her hiding spot, and reach the wilderness's edge. Her goal: to
assist Franca, cast a curse if Lumian's strike fell short, or create a
frosty hindrance on the ground. Unexpectedly, General Philip had
"escaped" to a location directly in front of her.

Such a golden opportunity couldn't be ignored!

Confused by the unfolding events, Jenna instinctively raised her right
hand, aiming her revolver at the back of General Philip's head.

Though unsure of the reasons behind this bizarre turn of events, she
suspected it was connected to the lucky gold coin she had received from
Will.

*Bang!*

Jenna squeezed the trigger, and a yellow bullet, wreathed in black
flames, shot out from the muzzle, hurtling toward General Philip's
skull.

Meanwhile, Franca emerged from the radiant Sunrise Gleam, witnessing
Anthony Reid overcoming his fear to employ his abilities on General
Philip. Lumian had for some reason arrived in the vicinity, appearing
mysteriously behind Philip.

Without time to dwell on her surprise, Franca swiftly raised her brass
classic revolver and fired an iron-black bullet at Gardner Martin, who
wielded his broadsword of light.

Her strategy was clear---unleash her full strength to stall Gardner
Martin and deny him the opportunity to save General Philip!

Franca's decision to use invisibility wasn't about tapping into Assassin
tactics to backstab her ex-lover. Drawing on her battle experience, she
instinctively chose invisibility for a different purpose---to escape
Gardner Martin and General Philip's sight, gaining a brief moment of
safety.

During this fleeting period, Franca not only moved with agility but also
retrieved the coin bag filled with coins. Wearing the iron-black Ring of
Punishment on her left thumb and Beatrice's Necklace around her neck,
she completed her ensemble.

Finally, she withdrew the Cannon Gun from her underarm holster, clasping
it firmly in her palm.

In her invisible state, Franca armed herself to the teeth, entering her
strongest state before the inevitable reveal.

*Bang!*

As the iron-black bullet sped toward Gardner Martin, Franca's diamond
necklace on her chest emitted a faint glow.

Simultaneously, Franca's eyes welled up, and her red lips parted
slightly, amplifying the allure of a Demoness of Pleasure.

Gardner Martin's body suddenly heated up, feeling his blood rush to his
nether regions.

Scenes of his past entanglement with Franca flooded his mind, captivated
by the Demoness's uncanny demeanor amidst iron and blood.

His eyes reddened, breathing grew labored, and movements visibly slowed.

Lust!

From Beatrice's Necklace and the lust of the Mother Tree of Desire
pathway, coupled with the charm of a Demoness of Pleasure, it had a
synergistic effect greater than the sum of its parts.

Moreover, Gardner Martin wasn't a stranger to such experiences. He had
always agreed with the words in Emperor Roselle's Secret Chronicles:
"The taste of a Demoness ain't bad." In this situation, how could he
control himself after tasting a Demoness?

*Clang!* The iron-black bullet struck Gardner Martin's chest,
causing cracks in his silver armor.

Franca, not surprised that the attack hadn't worked, realized in her
haste, she hadn't activated the Heavy Strike effect of the Cannon Gun.

The brass revolver, a mystical item purchased from the Curly-Haired
Baboons Research Society, wasn't particularly potent or mystical; it had
two simple abilities. The first, a normal shot, equivalent to a rifle,
and the second, a Heavy Strike, akin to a small cannonball or a sniper
rifle.

Franca always carried it to compensate for a Demoness's lack of
offensive capabilities when she couldn't use a curse. The Cannon Gun's
negative effects were minimal---if all six rounds were not fired in a
day or maintained every other week, rare situations like chamber
explosions or misfires could occur.

Observing Gardner Martin's infatuated gaze behind the visor, Franca
hesitated before using her right thumb to pull back the Cannon Gun's
hammer, signaling the activation of the Heavy Strike effect.

*Bang!*

As Franca moved, she pulled the trigger at Gardner Martin, who lunged at
her as if seeking a mate.

The iron-black bullet collided with him, accompanied by blazing flames.

Almost simultaneously, Franca sensed an anomaly in the Primordial
Demoness figurine casually stuffed into her pocket.

Not only did it turn cold again, like ice, but it also trembled
slightly.

*Dammit! Why is it you again? Are you done!?* Franca, feeling
both angry and cautious, pulled the trigger and threw the palm-sized
bone figurine far away.

Simultaneously, on the other side, Jenna's bullet, fired from an
ordinary revolver, pierced the back of General Philip's head with black
flames. Unsurprisingly, the Deceased shattered like a mirror, his figure
outlined at the edge of the Sunrise Gleam created by Gardner Martin.

At that moment, as Franca hurled the Primordial Demoness's bone
figurine, General Philip's body froze.

Black flames erupted, silently igniting his Spirit Body. Cold frost
swiftly condensed, enveloping him.

Blood seeped from his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, emitting a series of
cracking sounds.

The mirror he carried appeared to have shattered.

He was clearly in a daze, as if he had been cursed.

Without hesitation, Lumian employed Spirit World Traversal once more,
emerging from behind General Philip.

Meanwhile, Anthony Reid had stood up, his expression no longer filled
with fear but focused hatred.

As Philip was not far from him, on the edge of the clear Sunrise Gleam,
he ran towards the general---his mortal enemy.

Philip's figure reflected in his eyes, and he couldn't help but smile.

His pupils turned vertical, tinged with a faint golden hue.

This time, he refrained from employing Frenzy, fearing it might cause
General Philip to lose control and transform, giving Gardner Martin an
opportunity to kill his team.

He chose Awe, also known as Dragon Might!

General Philip trembled.

Under normal circumstances, he wouldn't have succumbed to such a severe
Awe. At most, he would have experienced temporary fear. However, he was
in a dire state, influenced by an unknown force, betrayed by an item on
him. Consequently, his entire being fell into a blank state.

Observing this, Lumian refrained from using the Spell of Harrumph. His
right hand took the shape of a revolver again, aimed at the back of
General Philip's head, and fired a crimson fireball that was nearly
white from his fingertips.

Philip was jolted awake by a tangible premonition of danger, only to
witness his impending demise.

A wave of indignation washed over him.

Despite being stronger, possessing lethal strikes, and an array of
mystical abilities, he suffered a relentless beating without a chance to
retaliate. He didn't even have an opportunity to fight back before Death
knocked on his door.

In his eyes, countless fates interwove into a net, constantly changing,
as if mocking him.

This made him feel like a clown.

*Bang!*

General Philip's head exploded from Lumian's crimson, nearly white
fireball. Numerous skull fragments splattered with charred marks, red
blood, and milky-white brain matter.

The Deceased's lifeless body thudded to the ground, and an item rolled
out of the hidden pocket of the black cloak.

It was a pitch-black figurine, palm-sized and resembling a beautiful
woman. Long snake-like hair cascaded to its feet, and it had eyes of
various forms at the top.

*Wh---* Lumian's gaze instinctively shifted to the Primordial
Demoness figurine that Franca had thrown out.

Similar to the one on General Philip, one was pure white, while the
other was pitch-black.

Suddenly, Lumian grasped why General Philip had Mirror Substitution and
why he had appeared directly in front of Jenna, who was invisible.

With the special Primordial Demoness figurine, he naturally converged
with Demonesses!

Subsequently, Franca's official Primordial Demoness figurine resonated
with the pitch-black one, causing an abnormality that led to General
Philip being "cursed" by the item at a critical moment.

The pitch-black Primordial Demoness figurine was likely the item Gardner
Martin had smuggled into Trier through "Rat" Christo's smuggling
caravan!
