## Chapter 943: A New Fabrication

At 4:30 pm, Lumian gathered his personal belongings, changed out of the
security uniform, and prepared to leave work.

This job surprisingly had an 8-hour shift system, but he would have to
take turns on night shifts later.

It had to be said that Mr. Huang Tao was not too strict in his treatment
of employees, and was quite generous with the pay, even if some
departments did require frequent overtime, for which Mr. Huang still
provided overtime pay, and at a fairly high standard. If the overtime
was too late, there were also reimbursements for late-night snacks and
transportation.

So, although Mr. Huang was notorious for his womanizing, and some of the
company's policies were not very friendly or respectful towards certain
female employees, there were still many who were eager to join the Intis
Group.

Today, Lumian had been stationed at the main entrance, not assigned to
patrol the floors or monitor the security cameras. He had only
encountered Zhou Mingrui once in the morning, and had not seen him
since.

He was not disappointed about this, nor was he impatient---the pace was
just right.

He walked towards the bus stop, braving the scorching sun, and along the
way, he took out his phone to send a voice message to Franca: "I think
I've left a rather strong impression on Zhou Mingrui today. Although I
didn't notice any obvious changes in his expression, if I were in his
shoes, I would certainly suspect that it's not a coincidence that I just
happened to meet him at Dream Tutoring Classes and then immediately
started working at the Intis Group---that I must be tracking him, with
some hidden, sinister purpose.

"Given Zhou Mingrui's caution and prudence, he will most likely think
this way.

"Since he has formed such a deep impression, I won't be going back to
Xinhong District tonight. I'll find a cheap motel to stay at, and see if
there are any developments at night, whether it might lead to me being
kicked out of the dream."

"Ludwig is being taken care of by Anthony."

Soon, True Hidden Blade replied: "Doesn't this risk Zhou Mingrui
resigning? That's bound to be a contingency plan for such a cautious
person.

"I haven't even started the job yet! I've already bought several sets of
clothes, and spent quite a bit of money!"

Sensing Franca's concern about the money potentially going to waste,
Lumian chuckled and replied: "It shouldn't lead to that for now. I
deliberately didn't go and tamper with my background information or try
to forge a fake identity before the interview, so that my personal life
would be outrageous enough to not seem like I'm coming to investigate.

"Sometimes, a moderate degree of high-profile behavior can actually
reduce others' suspicions of you.

"And even if Zhou Mingrui does end up resigning, you can still join the
company normally. There's no rule that says Intis Group employees can't
investigate Zhou Mingrui's movements after work. Plus, the Intis Group
has a lot of issues hidden, like Luo Shan, and Grimm. If we can uncover
them, it might give us some inspiration to find a way to awaken Mr.
Fool."

He had informed Franca and the others about the problem with Grimm
earlier that day.

Finally, Lumian added: "Remember to use the Information Shredder to
delete the chat log."

He reached the bus stop and carried out the operation to eliminate any
traces.

Soon, the bus arrived. Since it was not the usual rush hour, there
weren't many passengers.

Lumian relaxed a bit.

When he had taken the subway earlier, there had been an incident where a
man had tried to grope him in the crowded environment, nearly having his
wrist twisted off by Lumian.

He wasn't afraid of such things, he just found it annoying and a waste
of his time and energy.

If he was experiencing this as a male, what would happen if he switched
to his Demoness state?

†

Dechuang Garden.

Franca played Lumian's voice message so that Jenna could hear it.

As Jenna was using the Information Shredder to delete the chat log, she
was either folding the new clothes one by one or hanging them directly
in the closet.

They had gone to the garment wholesale market again that morning, but
this time they chose higher quality and more expensive items, spending
nearly two thousand.

After washing, "baking dry", and ironing, the clothes were now ready to
wear.

"I've already applied to start work tomorrow," Franca said
contemplatively as she helped fold the clothes.

In her previous life, she hadn't even finished university, never getting
the chance to experience work. After her transmigration, she had lived
off the original body's savings for a while, then by chance became an
Assassin, bidding farewell to a regular job.

Jenna smiled. "Just remember that you're going there to investigate the
issues and interact with Mr. Fool's dream manifestations, not because
you actually want the job. Then you won't care about how others view
your work performance."

"Mm, I wonder when Zhou Mingrui will resign." Franca chuckled. "I hope I
can at least get one month's salary!"

After tidying up the clothes, the two Demonesses leaned against pillows
on the bed and started scrolling on their phones.

After browsing for a while, Franca clicked her tongue and said, "Mr.
Huang really does have a lot of rumors surrounding him..."

Huang Tao himself rarely posted anything on social media, but it was
impossible to avoid the many ex-girlfriends he had had, numbering in the
hundreds, of all kinds---from famous actresses and singers to wannabe
Internet celebrities who wanted to gain attention by sharing their love
stories with the big company president, and even some who staged and
acted out their own stories, despite having no real connection to Huang
Tao.

So no matter what Franca and the others browsed, they would come across
stories about Mr. Huang and his women every now and then, reinforcing
the impressions they had formed from Roselle's diary and the
corresponding legends.

However, Franca still wanted to say that Mr. Huang was truly generous
with his money, and would not set traps to reclaim the gifts he had
given, or have the women thrown in jail.

It was precisely because Huang Tao's many mistresses were verifiably
from the administrative department of the Intis Group that Franca had
discovered during her job interview that not many people were applying
for the positions for the sake of the job itself.

Of course, she herself was not applying for the job for the sake of the
job either, but to get close to Mr. Fool's dream manifestation.

Before Jenna could respond, Franca sighed again. "I can't even imagine
what the state of the administrative department at the Intis Group must
be, and for Mr. Huang to be able to manage such an administrative
department and still have the company thrive, he must be really
capable..."

Jenna also shared some of the other rumors she had come across about Mr.
Huang, and by 11 o'clock at night, the two Demonesses put down their
phones, turned off the lights, and fell asleep.

They once again found themselves in the strange space shrouded by a
frozen storm, seeing Luo Shan, now in casual attire, floating at the
edge of the semi-transparent barrier, having just pushed back the
invasion of the bizarre creatures into the dark depths. Luo Shan turned
and looked at them.

Franca and Jenna's planning had anticipated this scenario, so they did
not immediately make a move, but instead returned Luo Shan's gaze.

Their eyes met, and Luo Shan's low voice spoke, "Are you also people
with Beyonder powers?

"Are you here to investigate me?"

Her expression was full of wariness.

"Yes, and no." Franca responded in an ambiguous way.

Jenna used a touch of Charm and smiled amiably.

"You haven't left, and you're even willing to meet with us."

Luo Shan was silent for a few seconds before speaking, "Last night, I
hid away, and discovered that you had taken my place, guarding the
barrier and dealing with those monsters.

"I feel, I feel, that you must be a good person, and perhaps we can
talk."

Before Jenna could respond, Luo Shan pressed on, "What do you mean,
'yes, and no'?"

Franca organized her thoughts and said seriously, "We want to approach
you, to figure out the issues with you, and eliminate the hidden
dangers, but we are not here to deal with you. The real target is not
you."

Luo Shan became a bit confused.

Franca further explained, "We are from the future, using a time machine
to return to the present, in order to find that Messiah."

"Messiah?" Luo Shan was bewildered.

*What the hell are you talking about?*

Franca nodded solemnly.

"In the not-too-distant future, humanity is under attack by evil forces
and is on the verge of extinction. That's when a Messiah suddenly
appears and rescues us, mitigating the dire situation.

"The evil forces, through some means, have created a time machine and
sent some monster-disguised creatures to the present in this city,
trying to eliminate the Messiah while they are still weak.

"Fortunately, the future Messiah detected this and found a way for us to
also utilize the time machine.

"He exhausted the machine's last bit of power to send us back here, so
that we can find and eliminate those monsters, and help the young
Messiah overcome the interference and obstacles, truly awakening them.

"Our contact with you is actually to get closer to the young Messiah."

Jenna listened to Franca's narrative and was momentarily dumbfounded.

Although they had briefly discussed the general storyline beforehand,
she never expected Franca to be able to present it so convincingly.

The story seemed to align quite well with the actual situation, yet
there was a fundamental difference.

Luo Shan's expression fluctuated for a while, finding Franca's story too
far-fetched to be true, yet strangely familiar.

As her thoughts raced, she suddenly recalled something and blurted out,
"Is that future Messiah Zhou Mingrui?"

Franca was not startled. She had fabricated this story precisely to
probe how much Luo Shan knew and what information she had access to.

She didn't expect Luo Shan to readily accept the ridiculous plot, but to
accurately guess that the target was Zhou Mingrui.

Knowing she needs to deal with Mr. Fool's dream manifestations, but not
understanding why? Jenna pondered and nodded, while Franca countered,
"Why do you think so?"

Luo Shan's expression suddenly twisted in anguish.

"That voice, that voice made me give Zhou Mingrui the real Instigator
beverage.

"That was the first time it made a clear demand, and promised to reward
me with the Painter beverage afterwards.

"I felt having Beyonder powers was great at the time, and thought if
Zhou Mingrui could also obtain them, it might not be too bad..."

At this point, Luo Shan's voice suddenly choked up.

"I-I didn't mean to harm him, I really didn't..."

Franca tensed up.

"Did Zhou Mingrui drink the Instigator potion, I mean, beverage?"

The information provided by the Major Arcana card holders did not
mention Luo Shan giving Zhou Mingrui the Instigator beverage.

"I don't know." Luo Shan shook her head. "But there was some incident at
the neighboring company that day, I'm not sure if it's related to this
or not, I'm not sure..."

Seeing Luo Shan's mental state becoming unstable, Jenna changed the
subject.

"How many times have you had those beverages?"
