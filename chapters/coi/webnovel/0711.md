## Chapter 711: Choice

Since he was summoning his messenger, Lumian didn't perform the ritual
in Mr. Fool's name. He simply called forth Penitent Baynfel, who was
garbed in a black clergyman's robe, resembling a charred corpse with
black flames clinging to his body.

"I wish to enter into another contract with you," Lumian requested with
a smile.

He briefly recounted the power of Inevitability, the special contract,
the sharing of abilities, the potential price, and the negative effects,
awaiting Baynfel's decision.

Baynfel stayed silent for a few moments before responding in a deep
voice, "If you're not worried about the downsides, I have no
objections."

"What might the negative effects be?" Lumian inquired cautiously.

In Baynfel's empty, dark eye sockets, the dark flames that served as his
eyes flickered twice.

"That hinges on your choice. I can let you finalize the contract. Once
you know the specific negative effects, you can decide if you want to
seal the deal."

*Different choices lead to different negative effects? What
choices?* Lumian spoke the Mystical Language of Fate, filled
with curiosity and puzzlement, allowing the silver-black symbols, words,
and patterns to land on the faux goatskin, forming a short, powerful,
mysterious, and sinister contract document.

Through the connection forged by the Mystical Language of Fate, Lumian
sensed Baynfel's traits and abilities.

The Penitent's powers were intimately tied to shadows and darkness, but
most of them seemed to be submerged in murky depths. Lumian could sense
their presence, but he couldn't discern their nature.

The two abilities floating above the surface were Shadow Animation and
Spirit World Traversal. Their characteristics were Ancient Corpse.

*Perfect, Shadow Animation is just what I need... Baynfel probably
showcased it specifically for me... He's quite unique, completely
different from spirit world entities like Headless Bride, Abscessed
Hand, and Human-Faced Mantis... It's much more straightforward to truly
communicate with him...* As Lumian mused, he gained a deeper
understanding of Shadow Animation.

This was an active ability that could animate the shadows of oneself and
others. The former could be used to swap places with the body and evade
fatal damage when dodging was impossible. The latter would ensnare the
corresponding target, hindering their movements, but it couldn't inflict
much harm or completely restrain the opponent.

Activating it swiftly to produce instantaneous effects was its greatest
strength. Otherwise, it couldn't shield from death or injury. Its
drawback was that it could only maintain the activation of one shadow at
a time.

As a substitute, if the animated shadow perished, Lumian would have to
wait for the sun to rise or set before the shadow would reappear.
Shadowless individuals would be deathly afraid of sunlight and
instinctively dread it.

*In the past, my emotions and desires were volatile, and now I'm piling
on a fear of sunlight? If I really run into Mid-Sequence Beyonders of
the Sun pathway in the future, won't I be too terrified to even open my
eyes? Thankfully, this is a downside that only kicks in after losing the
shadow substitute. It's not permanent...* Lumian looked at
Baynfel and asked sincerely, "What sacrifice do you require? Or rather,
what price must I pay?"

So far, he still hadn't figured out the negative repercussions of
signing a contract with Baynfel.

Penitent Baynfel, with only a thin layer of charred skin clinging to his
bones, replied, "Any mystical item in your possession."

*Any one... Is this the so-called choice? Picking a mystical item to
offer directly shapes the ultimate negative effects?* Lumian had
an epiphany as he took stock of the mystical items he carried.

His knee-jerk thought was the Pride Armor. After all, he couldn't
effectively use the Sealed Artifact at present. However, looking at
Baynfel's charred corpse, he felt that he wasn't just sacrificing an
item but attempting to off his messenger. Furthermore, while he couldn't
use the Pride Armor for now, Franca, Jenna, and Anthony could. Lumian
had already taught them the corresponding usage techniques.

At the crux of it all was a single mantra: *Don't wear it yourself. Only
utilize the negative effects by letting the target trigger
them!*

As for proactively triggering higher-level negative effects in exchange
for indiscriminate area-of-effect damage, there was no way to teach
that. It had to be improvised based on the environment and the enemy's
traits. After all, Demonesses likely relished this method. It was
brutally effective in bullying targets without substitute-type
abilities!

*Mystery Prying Glasses, Flog boxing gloves, Eye of Truth, Lie earring,
Mr. K's finger, Symphony of Hatred bone flute, Fury of the Sea brooch,
Traveler's Bag, Omebella's umbilical cord remains, expired misfortune
gold coins and unlucky banknotes, Serial Killer Beyonder
characteristic...* Lumian went through these items one by one.

Excluding non-mystical items and ones that were very handy to him at the
moment, Lumian ultimately decided to choose between the Mystery Prying
Glasses and the Eye of Truth.

Their abilities overlapped to a degree. Keeping one sufficed.

After a brief moment of contemplation, Lumian opted to offer the Eye of
Truth to Baynfel.

He believed that the Mystery Prying Glasses had fewer negative effects
than the Eye of Truth when usage time was limited. Furthermore, the Eye
of Truth could only see the truth. The Mystery Prying Glasses could at
least be used to paint supernatural works and disguise himself. After
Lumian became an Ascetic, he could effectively rein in the urge to paint
while donning the Mystery Prying Glasses. He could paint as needed or
abstain.

Lumian produced the peculiar Eye of Truth and handed it to Baynfel.

Just as Baynfel grasped the eyewear, which appeared entwined with flesh
and blood vessels, Lumian suddenly sensed the downside of signing the
contract.

In scenes closely tied to Baynfel's past, he would witness truths better
left unseen.

*However, it's fine if such effects only happen when it involves this
messenger's enigmatic background. Otherwise, I would have cut today's
ritual short and made a new choice after finding a suitable contract
partner... In Aurore and Franca's words, seeing what shouldn't be seen
is a death sentence...* Lumian pondered for a moment and replied
to Baynfel in a deep voice, "The contract stands."

As he finished speaking, the short and sinister contract spontaneously
ignited without fire, transforming into silver-black symbols, words, and
patterns that seared onto Lumian's arm.

Lumian glanced down at his shadow and saw it warp on its own, as if
performing a powerful dance.

A smile spread across Lumian's face.

After about ten seconds, his shadow settled.

Lumian expressed his gratitude to Baynfel and ended the summoning,
stowing away all the items on the altar.

"It's done?" Franca asked eagerly.

It wasn't that she doubted Lumian couldn't even handle his messenger,
but she worried the nature of his abilities might not meet the
requirements or come with too many strings attached.

Lumian nodded and briefly recounted the situation with Shadow Animation.

As he walked towards the quarry cave's exit, he said to Franca, Jenna,
and Anthony, "Now, we can hatch a plan to deal with Moran Avigny.

"Franca, contact the Demoness of Black and let her know we're about to
make our move. However, to avoid spooking the family and hidden forces
behind Moran Avigny, she doesn't need to observe nearby for now. Just
request an emergency help charm from her that can contact her through a
mirror if the Mirror People have hidden allies. Yes, it's a golden
opportunity to test the Demoness of Black's stance towards the Tamara
family and the Mirror People. Also, inform the Eternal Blazing Sun
Church that they can get ready to cut us some slack.

"Jenna, write to Madam Judgment and clue her in on our plan in the event
the Demoness of Black is in bed with the Mirror People.

"Anthony..."

Lumian's mind raced as he considered various details and doled out
missions to his companions.

Franca, Jenna, and Anthony didn't just passively accept their tasks.
They actively chimed in with ideas and helped Lumian fill in gaps and
polish his brainstorming.

Upon returning to Apartment 702 at 9 Rue Orosai, Anthony ducked out
early to keep up appearances at the Trier Psychiatrist Guild. Jenna,
meanwhile, changed into a dark black cloaked dress and seized the chance
to play the part of a Witch.

Soon, only Lumian and Franca remained in the apartment's living room.

The atmosphere grew awkward, and a prolonged silence hung in the air.

Lumian broke the ice as if nothing had happened.

"How's Jenna coming along with digesting the Witch potion?"

Franca breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Not bad. She's found her
groove acting as a Witch. Ask around the market district and you'll hear
whispers of Witches appearing in the dead of night to punish rowdy
drunkards. Some claim to have fallen into an icy river. Some wake up the
next day aching all over, while others get splitting headaches come
evening and don't dare drink anymore. What they have in common is they
all ran into someone dressed as a Witch. Yes, some drunkards even
vanished into thin air..."

Franca's voice trailed off, replaced by a tone fit for telling ghost
stories.

"The missing ones committed serious offenses? The others are guilty of
beating their families, harassing passersby, and groping women?" Lumian
guessed with a smile, based on his read of Jenna.

"Bingo." Franca nodded with a bright smile.

Lumian pondered for a moment and asked, "Aren't you worried the Demoness
of Black will catch wind of this rumor and send someone to investigate?"

Franca felt smug and pointed at herself.

"You're looking at her! Me! In the Demoness Sect, I'm the one handling
matters tied to the market district!"

She then sighed and said, "Jenna is a natural. She whipped up a solid
acting plan in under a month. Maybe she can digest the Witch potion
before I advance to Affliction."

"If those incidents hadn't happened, she would've been a star actress.
Acting is second nature to her," Lumian agreed.

The two fell silent again.

After a few seconds, Franca put on a brave face and said, "Um, um, you
can't breathe a word to Jenna or anyone else about what I said or did
near the altar in the mirror world!"

Lumian asked in confusion, "Did you say or do anything out of the
ordinary back there?

"I don't recall..."

Franca was taken aback for a moment before flashing an understanding
smile.

She stood up with a breezy grin and walked to Lumian's side. She patted
his shoulder gratefully and said, "What a bro!"

She felt all the awkwardness had evaporated.

A few days later, as Moran Avigny attended an interministerial meeting,
Lumian appeared near the government-provided villa.
