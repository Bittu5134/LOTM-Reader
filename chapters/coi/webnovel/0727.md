## Chapter 727: Arrival

As Franca prepared the ritual, she considered her options and said to
Lumian, "The Overseer's mirror coordinates are indescribable and can
only be procured through mystical means. The Magic Mirror Spirit
Channeling Spell isn't capable of that. I intend to use standard spirit
channeling instead."

While the Magic Mirror Spirit Channeling Spell she had developed greatly
extended the duration of the channeling and the number of questions the
spirit would respond to, it was constrained by relying on the mirror as
a medium, forfeiting the chance for other types of interaction.

"Regular spirit channeling drastically restricts the intel we can
gather..." Lumian thought briefly and said, "For the first question, we
should have him provide the coordinates of the Overseer's mirror.
Second, ask about the whereabouts of the classic silver mirror utilized
for the ritual and leader communication. Third, inquire about the
identities and locations of the Mirror People in contact with him,
ranked by importance."

Once the third question was answered, the spirit channeling ritual would
come to its natural conclusion. Lumian suspected Moran Avigny might not
have time to "introduce" every Mirror Person under his command. Hence,
he asked for them to be prioritized based on the criticality of their
role and responsibilities.

"A classic silver mirror?" Franca asked, puzzled.

"Yes, Moran Avigny has a mirror akin to the classic silver one you used
to own. It's vital for communicating with Mirror Roselle," Lumian
explained succinctly.

While speaking, he crouched and rummaged through Moran Avigny's pockets.

Unfortunately, the Minister of Industry carried only a handful of large
bills and some loose change totaling 3,212 verl d'or.

Besides the money, there was an elegant golden mechanical pocket watch,
a meticulously embroidered handkerchief, and a wallet crafted by a
private designer and artisan.

But not a single item imbued with Beyonder powers!

Lumian couldn't resist mimicking Franca's inner thought: "Poor slob!"

He realized that as the sitting Minister of Industry, Moran Avigny was
under the watchful eye of official Beyonders. He was unlikely to carry
mystical items, Beyonder weapons, or anything that might reveal his
abnormality.

As a Sequence 5 Disciplinary Paladin of the Judgment pathway, disclosing
this to the two Churches would raise difficult questions about how he
obtained the potion formula and Beyonder characteristics at that level.
When signing the contract, he would at most acknowledge being a Beyonder
of a related pathway without specifying the Sequence. This cost him the
chance to procure items openly, forcing him to rely on
Brokers---something official Beyonders couldn't be privy to.

Moran Avigny didn't require the Overseer's assistance with the Under the
Table deal to access mystical items, as Mirror People could transfer
objects through mirrors. If he genuinely needed an item for a specific
purpose, he could reach out to his mirror world associates and have them
"send" it over, returning it promptly after use.

Lumian sighed, pocketed the cash, watch, and other belongings, and rose
to his feet.

With Franca's spirit channeling preparations complete, Lumian turned to
Jenna, still composing her letter, and asked, "You shot without
hesitation earlier. Did it weigh on you at all? This wasn't a battle.
We'd been engaged in friendly conversation with Moran Avigny for a while
now. I even started to feel like we were becoming friends."

Jenna glanced up at Lumian while writing on a protruding rock of the
cave wall. She laughed softly.

"Worried I'll bottle up my emotional turmoil and cause issues down the
line? Planning to play psychiatrist and offer me counseling?"

Anthony Reid, who had been observing silently, living up to his role as
a Spectator, scratched his nose self-consciously.

That seemed to be his job.

However, he could discern that Jenna and Franca were not in need of
counseling.

Lumian didn't tackle Jenna's question head-on. With a smile, he
remarked, "You haven't taken many lives yourself."

"Had we not pulled the trigger, would you have taken action? Despite
feeling you had befriended Moran Avigny, I think you wouldn't have
flinched at blowing his head off," Jenna retorted, a smile playing on
her lips.

Lumian let out a derisive snort. "I'm not like you. I've killed more
people than I can count."

Jenna met his gaze again. "Moran Avigny admitted to his crimes. He lured
the real Moran Avigny into the mirror, holding him captive before
ruthlessly ending his life. I felt no qualms about carrying out the
execution of a guilty man."

"You've changed..." Lumian let out an exaggerated sigh and quipped,
"Once upon a time, you depended on the police and authorities to punish
the bad guys."

Jenna didn't have a chance to respond, as Franca had finished her spirit
channeling.

In the wavering dark-green candlelight, Moran Avigny's spirit took shape
above his corpse, perceptible to those who had activated their Spirit
Vision.

Franca acted swiftly. Withdrawing the glass-like Mirror Cufflink from
her sleeve, she addressed Moran Avigny's spirit, "Give me the
coordinates of the Overseer's mirror."

Moran Avigny's indistinct, menacing face twisted in anguish.

But stripped of life, he no longer had the ironclad self-control to
resist the commanding pull of the spirit channeling. He stretched out
his right hand, motioning for Franca to hand over the Mirror Cufflink.

Anticipating this, Franca passed him the Mirror Cufflink.

As Moran Avigny's spirit clutched the cufflink, a shadowy light
shimmered across its form, drawn into the glass-like accessory.

Franca exhaled in relief upon the Mirror Cufflink's return.

Having achieved the primary objective, it was time to reap further
rewards!

Her mood buoyed, Franca inquired of Moran Avigny with piqued interest,
"Is there a functional classic silver mirror in your possession... Hold
on..."

Abruptly realizing this constituted a question, she hastily
rephrased."Where is the classic silver mirror the Overseer used to
facilitate communication with your leader?"

Lumian had already ascertained Moran Avigny didn't have it on him.

Moran Avigny's spirit responded with cold rigidity, "Griffith has it.
When I require it, I have him deliver it to me through the mirror."

Franca's initial elation quickly gave way to an exasperated curse.

"Dammit!"

It dawned on her that she couldn't extract Griffith's mirror coordinates
from Moran Avigny.

The spirit channeling had but one question remaining. She needed to ask
Moran Avigny about the Mirror People serving as their contacts and their
true identities. Requesting mirror coordinates was out of the question!

Lumian and Anthony immediately grasped the reason for Franca's
self-directed frustration, but they were powerless to intervene. Certain
questions hinged on preceding answers, and mirror coordinates couldn't
be conveyed through the Magic Mirror Spirit Channeling Spell.

Collecting herself, Franca fixed her gaze on Moran Avigny's spirit.
Marshaling her thoughts, she articulated, "Name the Mirror People in
contact with you. What roles do they play in the real world? Begin with
those of the highest rank and responsibility."

Moran Avigny's ghostly, blurred visage contorted once more. Despite his
resistance, he responded in a clipped tone, "First, there's Griffith,
who serves as my second-in-command. Originally, he was a key figure in
the Moses Ascetic Order. With our assistance, he's steadily elevating
his position within the Order. His aspiration is for the secret
organization to eventually join the alliance to open Fourth Epoch
Trier's seal..."

*The Moses Ascetic Order... The very group that clashed with Element
Dawn, headed by the Emperor's firstborn, Bernadette? If memory serves,
they primarily consist of Mystery Pryer pathway Beyonders... I can't
help but wonder if the Research Society has members from either faction.
There must be others like myself with multiple secret society
affiliations...* Franca listened intently, not daring to disrupt
Moran Avigny's account.

Moran Avigny proceeded to the second Mirror Person.

"Caratanza Tamara, part of our branch's Tamara family. He enlisted in
the military and now holds the rank of colonel. He legitimized his
Beyonder powers by slaying a Loen Kingdom spy, seizing their potion
formula and Judgment pathway characteristics...

"Palia, a ore scholar originally. She infiltrated the Trier Cave
Association to mask our attempts at uncovering a vulnerability in the
seal...

"Sport, Trier's Deputy Commissioner of Police and a member of the police
commission. His original self was purposely corrupted during an
operation. Subsequently, Griffith and Caratanza orchestrated an ambush,
dragging him into the mirror and allowing the mirror world's Sport to
emerge and assume his place..."

By this point, Moran Avigny's spirit had become increasingly
insubstantial, on the brink of dissipation.

At that instant, Jenna concluded her letter and pivoted to face Lumian.
"I'll now summon Madam Judgment's messenger."

The words had scarcely left her mouth when an ethereal voice, seemingly
originating from a great distance, reverberated in the ears of Jenna,
Lumian, and the others.

"Summoning won't be necessary."

A shared premonition compelled Lumian, Franca, Jenna, and Anthony to
direct their attention to the side of the quarry cave.

In the chamber's dim illumination, supplied only by carbide lamps and
candles, dazzling starlight coalesced in the void, rapidly tracing the
outline of an enchanting door.

Noiselessly, the door swung open, revealing an enormous pumpkin carriage
drawn by a multitude of gray rats.

Three women occupied the carriage's interior. One was Magician,
resplendent in a beige gown with a high collar adorned with golden
embroidery. Another was Judgment, her shoulder-length flaxen hair
complementing her grayish-white knight's attire, accented by brown
leather armor.

The third woman was clad in a purple dress bearing a cryptic pattern. A
celestial globe and sundry items dangled from her waist, and refined
spectacles perched upon her nose.

Clasped in her left hand was a peculiar lamp, its surface golden like a
kettle and adorned with enigmatic designs.
