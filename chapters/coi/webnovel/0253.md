## Chapter 253: Root of the Problem

Upon hearing Charlotte's words, Lumian grasped the problem in an
instant.

As soon as he reached the market district and attempted his first
Summoning Dance, he unintentionally summoned Susanna Mattise, who had
been drawn to Charlie, into his room.

At the time, Susanna seemed eager to possess him, but she instinctively
sensed the danger lurking within the seal and refrained from acting.
This mirrored the behavior of the peculiar creatures Lumian had summoned
before. It appeared that only by compelling them would they dare to take
hold of him.

Hence, Lumian didn't see anything amiss then. Even when he later
encountered Susanna Mattise again and gained deeper insight into the
Bliss Society, he failed to connect the dots.

But now, he realized his oversight.

Susanna Mattise was fundamentally different from the strange creatures
he had previously summoned!

The dissimilarity didn't lie in her status as a Sequence 5 evil spirit
who had failed to attain godhood, but rather in her possession of reason
and the ability to think. Besides being extremely fanatical and
persistent, she could also lead and develop a secret organization!

When such an evil spirit sensed the tremendously dangerous power sealed
within Lumian's body, even if she didn't immediately recognize it as
angelic-level corruption, she would have left in confusion and sought
revelation from the evil god she believed in!

By the time she grasped the situation, Lumian, possessing the strength
of a Low-Sequence Beyonder equivalent to an Angel, would be irresistibly
appealing to heretics skilled in sacrificial rituals. He would be no
less enticing than a hundred million verl d'or abandoned on the street
before a Scrooge.

Had it not been for Lumian's quick thinking, temporarily stunning her
with Fallen Mercury and deceiving Susanna Mattise during their second
encounter, the situation might have reached its conclusion before the
official Beyonders arrived.

For Charlie, an ordinary person, to successfully descend from the fifth
floor to Lumian's door and seek help despite Susanna Mattise's threats
and lingering presence, it seemed more than just mere luck.

One couldn't trust the words and emotions of an Actor, especially those
who were particularly good-looking!

In Charlotte Calvino's performance, Lumian had been scanning the
surroundings, hoping to utilize a Hunter's instincts to find an exit
from this peculiar space.

Yet, aside from the entangled tree roots blanketing the ground, the
colossal slowly-growing brownish-green tree, and the oil painting-like
blue sky with white clouds, there was nothing else.

In such an environment, Lumian's Pyromaniac instincts made him stop
hesitating. He released his grip on Mr. K's finger and flung it into the
air.

Almost simultaneously, the semi-illusory crimson Fire Ravens condensed
around him took flight, each tracing an elegant arc as they soared
toward the illusionary scene where Charlotte Calvino stood and the fog
of the past lingering on the surrounding branches.

Charlotte stepped out of the grand palace, suspected to be a scene
depicting Emperor Roselle's affair, and entered the White Maple Palace
during the Sauron royal era. There, a Beyonder who had transformed into
a man due to a potion but hadn't changed his sexual orientation was
scrutinizing the noble ladies' spouses.

The rumbling sounds persisted, yet Charlotte effortlessly evaded the
onslaught of Fire Ravens. The fog-shrouded scenes of the past remained
unyielding, as if they were truly nonexistent. However, the
brownish-green branches that bore them showed signs of scorching and
charring.

The Tree of Shadow was, after all, a tree, and thus susceptible to
combustion!

The only issue was that Lumian's Fire Ravens inflicted minimal harm upon
it.

In an explosive moment, Mr. K's finger detonated like a bomb,
transforming into a gruesome rain of flesh and blood that draped Lumian
in a hooded robe of crimson.

To Lumian's dismay, Mr. K didn't appear immediately. It was uncertain
whether it would take time to sense his presence or if the Tree of
Shadow had isolated this space from the real world.

Charlotte ventured into the illusory scene of a torrential downpour,
where a few naked figures sprinted about. Her white silk dress seemed
drenched, adhering to her body and accentuating her unusually exquisite
form.

She bestowed Lumian with a smile, her eyes akin to serene lakes tinged
with timidity, innocence, and purity.

A searing flame coursed through Lumian's being, igniting from his head
down to his very core.

Lumian's heart surged with longing. He darted between the entangled
roots, heading toward the brownish-green tree and the captivating figure
of Charlotte Calvino.

Charlotte didn't traverse the various illusory scenes. Instead, she
stepped onto a tree branch below and leaned against the brownish-green
trunk. Her body trembled slightly, as if yearning to hide but finding no
escape.

Lumian's eyes blazed with a reddened fury as his gaze fixated upon
Charlotte's sparkling eyes, moist lips, graceful neck, and alluring
curves. His thoughts became a chaotic haze.

Thus, he failed to notice Charlotte's abdomen and legs sinking into the
brownish-green trunk. He failed to observe the crack forming, unveiling
a colossal moist flower.

The vivid red flower bloomed gradually, akin to an enormous mouth
anticipating its prey.

Lumian lunged toward Charlotte, propelled by his fervor.

Charlotte couldn't help but smile.

At that very moment, a muffled explosion erupted from Lumian's right
pocket.

*Boom!*

Underneath his blood-colored robe, a ball of flames burst forth, ripping
through his pocket and igniting his shirt, causing an agonizing pain to
course through Lumian's waist.

Lumian's eyes regained some semblance of clarity. Swiftly, he reached
out and grasped Charlotte's wrist, keeping a minimal distance between
himself and the moist flower.

Having long been aware of the Mother Tree of Desire's ability to awaken
various desires, how could Lumian not have been on guard against
Charlotte's seduction?

However, in order to prevent the other party from detecting his defenses
prematurely and setting a trap, he chose not to directly soak the
Mysticism Smelling Salts in cloth and place it near his nose. Nor did he
turn the dagger around, preparing for the collision that would bring him
back to his senses. In their current predicament, such methods held
little reliability, for Charlotte might not allow him to truly pounce on
her.

Hence, Lumian opted to create a small fireball with a delayed explosion
in his pocket, all the while gripping Mr. K's finger!

If he remained unaffected and the fireball neared detonation, he could
choose to dispel it and create another.

The small fireball inflicted negligible harm upon him. Its primary
purpose was to awaken him through pain.

As for the resultant burn injuries, Lumian paid them no heed.

Pyromaniacs held no fear of such trivialities!

In an instant, Lumian seized Charlotte's wrist, and he caught a flicker
of fear on her face.

Without delay, two serpent-like crimson flames burst forth from Lumian's
palm, searing their way along Charlotte's arm toward her body and head.

Instinctively, Charlotte tilted her neck back, emitting a pained groan
as her skin swiftly turned black from the scorching flames.

Just as Lumian was on the verge of engulfing her entirely, a wave of
intense danger washed over him.

He attempted to pull Charlotte to the side, but she appeared to meld
with the brownish-green tree. No matter how hard Lumian tugged, he
couldn't extricate her.

Reluctantly, Lumian abandoned his futile efforts and lunged to his
right.

With a muffled thud, a tree trunk as thick as a wine glass descended
from the sky, impaling the ground teeming with tangled roots like a
javelin, its tip quivering violently.

Lumian glanced upward and beheld Susanna Mattise, her turquoise hair
cascading around her, her emerald eyes and scarlet lips.

She possessed a translucent quality, standing amidst the dense and
ethereal canopy of the tree, blending seamlessly with it.

Both the brownish-green trunk and the outstretched branches bore
colossal wet flowers in pale hues, flourishing and blooming.

On Avenue du Marché, inside the khaki-colored four-story building that
housed the parliament member's office.

In a corner, Jenna observed Hugues Artois, garbed in elegance, leading
his secretary Rhône and others through the gathering. With a glass of
champagne in hand, he offered consolation, made promises, and delivered
impromptu speeches with mere words. In response, he received sincere
gratitude, unveiled dependence, and instinctive flattery.

Jenna couldn't help but recall a question Lumian had once posed to her:
*"Do you wish to sit here and watch as the murderers responsible for
your mother's death and the destruction of your happiness revel in
champagne, indulge in dance parties, and inflict more heartbreak on
innocent families?"*

Unconsciously, Jenna's fists clenched, her knowledge of the truth
fueling an uncontrollable anguish.

However, she understood the need to restrain herself. Acting impulsively
wouldn't yield results. She had to endure.

This was because following the proper procedures, she couldn't take
action against a parliament member without substantial evidence. And if
she desired to seek justice independently, her adversaries boasted
several Beyonders who had been bestowed with an evil god's boon and were
protected by official Beyonders and armed personnel.

All she could do was endure and await the future!

Within the confines of Auberge du Coq Doré, ensnared by branches and
vines, Franca stood near the staircase, her face flushed and her eyes
glistening as she battled to suppress the overwhelming desire coursing
through her veins.

Her right hand trembled as she retrieved the canister of Mysticism
Smelling Salts obtained from Rentas. With a twist of the lid, she raised
it to her nose.

*Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!*

A series of sneezes erupted, marking Franca's triumph over her desires
and the gradual return of her rationality.

Swiftly scanning her surroundings, she realized that Lumian, who had
been mere steps away, had vanished.

Taking note of the unnatural transformations plaguing the motel and the
adjacent streets engulfed by colossal trees, Franca clenched her teeth
and arrived at a resolution. The tree crowns above seemed to grow
increasingly ethereal as they reached skyward, extending into an
otherworldly realm.

She retrieved two objects from her possession.

They were a pair of tarot cards.

One depicted a man and a woman raising their cups in a greeting---the
Two of Cups. In the center, a wooden staff coiled by twin serpents stood
prominently.

The other card portrayed an angel sounding a trumpet, calling forth the
resurrection of the departed---the Judgment card!
