## Chapter 164: Intelligence

Salle de Bal Brise, the café on the second floor.

Lumian strolled over to Baron Brignais with an air of nonchalance and
took a seat.

Not only did he lack any sense of deference or humility, but he also
showed a blatant disregard for basic politeness, as if they were equals.

Louis, standing discreetly behind Baron Brignais, silently shook his
head.

He had encountered many such individuals before, and their fate had
always been the same---either handed over to the police by the Savoie
Mob or gravely wounded in a violent gunfight, losing their capabilities
in the process. They had no choice but to become subservient, like dogs
wagging their tails, in exchange for the gang's protection. Some met
their demise due to various reasons, their bodies cast into the dark
recesses of the underground world or packed into wooden barrels filled
with stones and thrown into the depths of the Srenzo River.

"Good evening, Baron," Lumian greeted with a disarming smile.

Baron Brignais betrayed no sign of anger on his face. He leisurely took
a puff from his mahogany-colored pipe and casually inquired, "Where have
you been this afternoon?"

"Underground," Lumian responded, resembling the corpse that had imbibed
the Prophecy Concoction. He answered the other party's questions without
any elaboration.

If "Little Minx" Jenna and "Red Boots" Franca concealed the fact that he
had dispatched the pervert and saved the former, his response would have
been a display of utmost candor.

Baron Brignais appeared momentarily taken aback but refrained from
further probing. As he rubbed the mahogany pipe in his hand, he calmly
stated, "I have a task for you."

Without waiting for Lumian to inquire, he explained with a smile, "I
hold great expectations for you. I believe you can become a crucial
member of our Savoie Mob, entrusted with significant matters.

"However, my favorable opinion alone is insufficient. You must
demonstrate strength that surpasses most and make contributions that
garner their recognition."

*A carrot dangling before a donkey?* Lumian scoffed inwardly.

Outwardly, he deliberately narrowed his eyes.

"And what might this be about?"

Baron Brignais set aside his mahogany pipe, took a sip of his coffee,
and adopted a soothing tone as he spoke,

"Assault any prominent member of the Poison Spur Mob. It would be best
if you inflict severe injuries. Killing them outright works too."

Lumian chuckled.

"Just two days ago, you cautioned me against causing a commotion and
provoking an all-out conflict between the Poison Spur Mob and us.

"Aren't you concerned that such actions might transpire, ultimately
leading to you becoming a target of the police headquarters?"

Although he had intended to lie in wait for the Poison Spur Mob's
"Hammer" Ait, Lumian refused to be treated as a fool by Baron Brignais.

Baron Brignais nodded, pleased with Lumian's astuteness.

"You are far more intelligent than those who surround me.

"For the past two days, I've been closely observing the Poison Spur
Mob's reactions, and it seems they have no immediate plans for revenge
against you.

"What does that imply?"

"It means they're terrified of our Savoie Mob," Lumian replied with a
jest.

It was, of course, a jest. If the Poison Spur Mob feared the Savoie Mob,
they would never have grown to become the second-largest mob in Le
Marché du Quartier du Gentleman.

Baron Brignais shook his head.

"In the past, they would have undoubtedly retaliated, exacting a higher
toll than just medical expenses from our Savoie Mob.

"Moreover, after Margot's demise, they merely put on a show on the
surface. In reality, they took no actions that would attract the
police's attention. It seemed they were searching for the true assassin
amidst the chaos.

"These recurring anomalies lead me to believe that the Poison Spur Mob
is preparing for something significant---something very, very important.
That's why they remain patient and restrained.

"I can't be certain whether their forthcoming actions will impact our
Savoie Mob, but we cannot idly wait for answers."

*At least you're astute...* Lumian grudgingly commended Baron
Brignais within his thoughts.

With a smile, Lumian posed a question, "Are you suggesting that I
eliminate their key members and observe their reactions?

"If they endure it without retaliation, it signifies a considerably
grave problem. We would need to instigate a full-blown conflict and
compel them to expose the issue, wouldn't we?"

Baron Brignais chuckled.

"I enjoy conversing with clever individuals.

"So, are you willing to undertake this task?"

Though his tone appeared inquisitive, his posture, gaze, and actions
left no doubt that it was an order.

Should Lumian refuse, the Savoie Mob would withdraw its protection.

Lumian chuckled.

"I require information on all the significant members of the Poison Spur
Mob---names, appearances, capabilities, distinguishing traits, and
whether they have immediate family or spouses..."

Louis, who stood behind Baron Brignais, was taken aback.

*Why is he asking about the family members of the Poison Spur Mob
leaders? Is he planning to use them?*

Among Trier's mobs, an unspoken rule prevailed---one that everyone
abided by unless it was an exceptional circumstance: never target family
members who weren't involved in the mob.

Most individuals had parents, spouses, and children. If they were to
abandon all moral boundaries and kill without hesitation, none would be
spared. Everyone would be in jeopardy.

Secondly, dealing with the families of low-ranking mobsters held no
value. However, at Baron Brignais's level, his family remained
confidential, known to only a select few. Furthermore, they resided
outside Le Marché du Quartier du Gentleman.

Thirdly, those who held a certain status within the mob could be deemed
ruthless. Threatening them with their families would only ignite their
fury.

Fourthly, the annihilation of a family would inevitably make headlines,
angering the higher-ups at the police headquarters and triggering a
severe crackdown.

Thus, it was only in the process of eliminating a faction that they
would confront the family of an enemy leader, avoiding the sowing of
seeds of animosity and serving as a deterrent to other mobs.

What was Ciel's intention inquiring about the immediate family and wife
of a crucial member of the Poison Spur Mob?

Baron Brignais gazed at Lumian for a few moments before a slow smile
crept across his face.

"The boss of the Poison Spur Mob is Roger, known as Black Scorpion. He
resides at 126 Avenue du Marché. I'm uncertain if he has a wife or
immediate family. Even if he does, they aren't in the market district.
They might not even be in Trier.

"He possesses sinister spells and magical powers. Even I wouldn't dare
to confront him."

Baron Brignais seized the opportunity to caution Lumian about the
formidable strength of "Black Scorpion" Roger. It was wise to avoid any
designs against him, for death would be the only outcome.

*Sinister spells... A Beyonder focused on spellcasting? Considering
Roger's ability to subdue Margot, he must be at least a Sequence 7. He
might even possess a mystical artifact or Beyonder weapon... If
Beyonders of this caliber lack robust bodies or special life-preserving
abilities, they may resort to traps, close-range assassinations, and
other methods. If their bodies aren't weak and they excel in close
combat, or if they possess a substitution spell like Leah's paper
figurine, I'll have hardly any chance of victory. Unless I employ the
Luck Transference Spell to prearrange his misfortune and make him
sufficiently unlucky... *Lumian's thoughts raced like lightning,
fleeting as they disappeared.

He nodded and inquired, "What about the others?"

Baron Brignais took a leisurely puff on his pipe before responding,"The
Poison Spur Mob once had four powerful and significant members who were
slightly inferior to us in the market district. However, after Margot's
demise at your hands, his replacement, Wilson, is quite feeble. Their
overall strength has greatly diminished.

"Roger's deputy, 'Baldy' Harman, is one of them. Initially, he and Roger
arrived in the market district, establishing the Salle de Gristmill and
gradually recruiting a group of individuals to form the Poison Spur Mob.

"He's highly skilled in combat, on par with Margot in that regard.
Additionally, he possesses peculiar abilities. For instance, he can
withstand a blade and only suffer minor injuries. At times, he exhibits
sudden bursts of violence, as if under the influence of some drug. He
can instill fear in others. Oh, and he wields a knife coated with
poison.

"He's exceedingly cruel. He doesn't have a family or a mistress, but he
takes a keen interest in women. He often dallies with street girls under
the Poison Spur Mob.

"His usual residence is 'Black Scorpion' Roger's house. When he seeks
the company of a woman, he opts for a relatively clean motel or hotel
within the market district."

Lumian listened attentively, gradually formulating a plan.

*There's a highly effective trap for 'Baldy' Harman.*

*Regardless of how Harman acquires such formidable defenses that only
result in minor injuries after being slashed, it suggests a high
probability that he's willing to trade injuries for victory. He relies
heavily on his strengths in this aspect.*

*If that's the case, I can provide him an opportunity. However, Fallen
Mercury will be the one to inflict those minor injuries upon
him.*

*Even minor wounds can bleed!*

Baron Brignais continued, "Most of the dancers under the Poison Spur Mob
are under the supervision of Castina from Feynapotter. She was abducted
to Trier and later became 'Black Scorpion' Roger's mistress.

"'Short-legged Candlestick' was her nickname back when she worked as a
dancer, owing to her relatively petite stature."

Lumian envisioned a compact candlestick and formed a rough image of
Castina in his mind.

"Castina doesn't engage in frequent fights, but she exhibits remarkable
combat skills when she does. She's cold and merciless when dealing with
disobedient dancers. Perhaps she's forgotten the hardships she endured,"
Baron Brignais remarked with a touch of gentlemanly courtesy. "She
resides in an apartment at 19 Rue du Rossignol. We're unsure of the
specific floor or room she occupies. She often frequents Roger's house."

*What right do you have to speak of her like that? Why don't we discuss
the person who became a singer at Salle de Bal Brise after her father
was forced to die due to a debt? *Lumian never believed that
mobsters possessed a true conscience.

No matter the camaraderie, loyalty, or care they exhibited toward their
peers, they were merely wildflowers adorned with mud. They essentially
sought out victims among the dancers, street girls, ordinary individuals
persecuted by loan sharks, and the peddlers they extorted.

Brignais proceeded to introduce the final leader of the Poison Spur Mob.

"'Hammer' Ait was originally a member of our Savoie Mob. He possessed
courage, intellect, and a sturdy physique. I held him in high regard and
planned to recommend him to the boss. However, he betrayed us and joined
the Poison Spur Mob. He swiftly acquired Beyonder powers.

"I suspect he consumed a potion from the Warrior pathway and has already
reached Sequence 8. His towering height, nearly 1.9 meters, and his
conduct during conflicts lead me to this deduction.

"'Hammer' describes his fists, which possess the hardness and force of
iron hammers. He typically fights unarmed, but he's also adept with a
revolver and a dirk.

"He resides at 25 Rue des Pavés, adjacent to Le Marché du Quartier du
Gentleman. There is a sizable contingent of Poison Spur Mob members in
that area."

*Pugilist? Will Beyonder characteristics manifest upon his
demise?* Lumian nodded and queried Baron Brignais,

"I also require their approximate travel patterns. Additionally, provide
me with a revolver, an ample supply of bullets, and a portable weapon. A
dirk, dagger, bayonet, or axe will suffice."

"No problem. I'll have Louis deliver them to you tomorrow morning."
Baron Brignais nodded with satisfaction.

After observing Ciel depart from the café, Louis lowered his voice and
inquired, "Baron, are we truly going to let him confront the leaders of
the Poison Spur Mob?"

Baron Brignais chuckled.

"Didn't you hear my explanation earlier? I didn't deceive him about
this.

"However, the leaders of the Poison Spur Mob are not easily dealt with.
Whether he struggles and requires our aid and protection afterward, or
if he fails and finds himself on the brink of death, we can crush his
arrogance and make him obedient."
