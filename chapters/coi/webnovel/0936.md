## Chapter 936: Contradictions

Jenna didn't follow Luo Shan, knowing she would call a ride-hailing
service. Whether using shadow stealth or invisibility, Jenna couldn't
keep up with a car by running for long---unless the target encountered
repeated traffic jams. In this respect, Demonesses excelled at bursts of
speed but lacked endurance.

As for taking a taxi herself and having the driver follow the target,
leaving aside whether a taxi would happen to pass by or if a booked ride
could arrive within a minute, the biggest problem was finding a
reasonable excuse.

Jenna believed that if Franca were here, with her understanding and
familiarity with the dream city, she could easily find a convincing
reason. But Jenna herself couldn't yet---she might say the wrong thing
and cause the driver to call the police on the spot.

Of course, this problem could be solved using Charm, but after she got
out of the car and the effect gradually faded, the driver would recall
what happened and likely feel something was off, possibly reporting it
to the police. Jenna couldn't repeatedly Charm someone over such a small
matter, making them fall in love with her for an extended period.

Leaving the window, Jenna made a bowl of noodles and enjoyed eating it
completely, drinking all the soup.

When night truly fell, she took out the Ice Mirror Charm made by Lumian
and held it in her palm.

As she uttered the word "mirror" in ancient Hermes, the mystical charm
carved from frost lit up with a somewhat dim glow.

Jenna placed her hand on the mirror she had put on the coffee table
earlier. Her entire body suddenly dematerialized and entered it.

Using the Ice Mirror Charm's ability to sense surrounding mirrors, she
quickly locked onto a mirror-like object in Luo Shan's home and
traversed through a dark, illusory tunnel.

She wanted to take advantage of Luo Shan being out to search her home
from within the mirror, seeing if she could discover anything.

The reason she didn't do this while Luo Shan was at work during the day
was that such probing had to be gradual. She first needed to confirm
whether last evening's level of contact with Luo Shan would attract the
Celestial Worthy's attention or provoke investigation by hostile forces.

After waiting a day and night, she now tentatively confirmed it
wouldn't, so she could proceed with further contact and investigation.

Jenna didn't leave the dark, illusory area behind the mirror. Through
the hard, cold glass, she surveyed Luo Shan's home.

This apartment was also a one-bedroom, with the same layout as the one
she rented. She was currently positioned at the living room window
immersed in the night.

Above the window, Jenna's face faintly and indistinctly appeared, her
gaze sweeping over the coffee table, TV, refrigerator, and other items.

She quickly noticed easels, canvases, paper, palettes, paint tubes,
various brushes, and small palette knives scattered in different places.
Paintings hung on the walls---vibrant oil paintings, pencil sketches,
and black and white freehand landscapes.

Jenna's gaze suddenly stopped on one of the oil paintings.

It depicted a strange half-human, half-snake creature---the upper body a
voluptuous woman, the lower body a giant snake with lifelike scales.

*The monster I saw last night...* Jenna's heart tightened as she
successively recognized other paintings depicting bizarre creatures she
had seen invading the "spirit residential district" woven from psychic
energy during her astral projection last night.

Almost simultaneously, she noticed a common element in these paintings:
All the strange creatures were confined in iron-barred cages.

*What does this represent? Does it symbolize these monsters being kept
out of the world? This is close to the scene I saw during my astral
projection walk last night... Did Luo Shan paint the iron-barred cages,
while the monsters came from someone else's hand? Or did Luo Shan paint
these monsters but then lock them up?* As Jenna pondered
seriously, her gaze fell on a sketch.

It was Luo Shan's self-portrait, her face smiling, eyes spirited, quite
charming.

For some reason, Jenna felt the Luo Shan in this self-portrait was
intently observing the dark living room.

This made her abandon the idea of leaving the window glass and truly
entering the room.

As Jenna continued observing, the fingerprint lock on the front door
made a sound, and Luo Shan returned home carrying her white handbag.

After placing the handbag on the dining table, Luo Shan walked lightly
to her sketch self-portrait and looked at it for a few seconds.

Then, she picked up a brush, dipped it in some silver paint, and walked
towards the living room window.

Jenna had retreated a bit before the door opened, allowing the glass
window reflecting the night to return completely to normal.

Luo Shan stared at the glass window for a while, then raised her brush
and outlined a simple door on its surface.

In the area behind the mirror, Jenna suddenly saw a silver light shine
on the hard glass surface, forming a very real, strange door connecting
reality and the mirror world.

She immediately left a few Demoness black flames to burn away any
residual traces, then traversed the illusory dark tunnel herself,
returning to her rented place and emerging from the mirror.

Where Jenna had originally been hiding, the not-quite-real silver door
was pushed open, and Luo Shan entered the area behind the mirror.

The girl in a casual long dress looked around with a gloomy expression,
finding nothing unusual in the area.

Luo Shan gazed at the dense spider web-like tunnels in the mirror,
unable to think of what to paint to utilize them.

After two or three minutes, she exited the area behind the mirror and
wiped away the silver door outlined on the glass window's surface with
her palm.

___

23rd floor, Room 3.

Jenna sat on the sofa and silently muttered to herself, *Luo Shan is
indeed a Beyonder of the Painter pathway... Has the deity worshiped by
the Fantasy Association also infused some power?*

*Is He also at Mu Shu Hospital, or does He have His own
stronghold?*

*Did He give Luo Shan Beyonder power to control this colleague of Zhou
Mingrui and contact Mr. Fool's dream image?*

Just as she thought of this, Jenna's phone on the coffee table began to
vibrate.

Jenna picked it up and saw that Luo Shan had sent her a message with an
image.

This girl, whose WeChat nickname was "Always Wanting to Go on Vacation",
said with a smiley face emoji: "This is my work, you can take a look."

The content of that image was precisely the sketch self-portrait Jenna
had seen earlier in Luo Shan's home.

Jenna opened the image and suddenly had the illusion that Luo Shan had
come to life on her phone screen.

She had an idea and just left her phone on the coffee table without
locking the screen.

Then, she stood up, walked to the bathroom, and closed the door.

As soon as Jenna sat on the toilet, she immediately turned her gaze to
the vanity mirror.

Using a Demoness's mirror magic and the mirror on the coffee table, she
peered at her phone's situation.

A few seconds later, Jenna saw the sketch portrait displayed on the
screen seem to make a tiny movement. The Luo Shan outlined in pencil
lines tentatively reached out a hand beyond the screen, then withdrew
it.

*As expected...* Jenna pressed the toilet's flush button, washed
her hands amid the rushing sound, and exited the bathroom.

She picked up her phone again, closed the image, and used voice-to-text
to reply to Luo Shan: "It looks so lifelike!"

She hadn't checked Luo Shan's Moments last night because they were set
to "Chat Only".

"Want me to sketch you too?" Luo Shan quickly replied to Jenna's praise.

*I wouldn't dare let you Painters draw me...* Jenna silently
muttered, using voice input to respond to Luo Shan: "No need, no need."

She quickly changed the subject.

"You might not believe this, but I had a very strange dream yesterday,
and you were in it.

"You seemed to be guarding the neighborhood, fighting a group of
monsters, while we couldn't help at all."

If a man had said something similar to her, Jenna would definitely think
he was trying to flirt, feeling their relationship was too shallow for
such intimate talk, clearly inappropriate. But now, relying on the fact
of both being women, she dared to probe a little.

"Did I leave such a deep impression on you?" Luo Shan sent a "smug"
emoji.

After a few seconds, she sent a second message: "Your dream is very
interesting. I'm also very happy to play such a role in your
dream---really, extremely happy."

Just as Jenna was about to reply, Luo Shan sent a third message:
"Because my father was a true guardian, as were his colleagues."

Jenna suddenly recalled the background introduction of Luo Shan in the
files:

In reality, Luo Shan's father was a Nighthawk of the Church of Evernight
Goddess, who died in an accident brought about by a mystical case. His
father's colleagues included the Nighthawk team captain Dunn
corresponding to Officer Deng, Officer Deng's fiancée Miss Daly, Old
Neil from Interpol, and others. They all died in disasters brought by
Beyonder powers but also protected their corresponding cities.

*One of Mr. Fool's incarnations is Klein Moretti, a member of that
Nighthawk team back then, so when Mr. Fool subconsciously wove his dream
image, did he add a similar background to Luo Shan, making her admire
and aspire to the spirit of protection?*

*Although Luo Shan has now been influenced by that evil god of the
Fantasy Association and received an illusory boon, has the protective
obsession deep in her heart not been completely erased by the
contamination? Is this the reason for her many contradictory behaviors
currently?*

*Painting strange creatures on one hand, wanting to make them real,
while adding cages to these invaders on the other... Constantly creating
monsters on one hand, while guarding at the barrier on the other, not
letting those monsters in...*

*Could this be considered Mr. Fool's subconscious projection onto Luo
Shan fighting against the corruption of that evil god of the Fantasy
Association?*

*If this is really the case, in a sense, this is a confrontation between
a small part of Mr. Fool's subconscious and that evil god of the Fantasy
Association...* Jenna pondered with some understanding how to
reply to Luo Shan.

After about ten seconds, she used voice input to say: "Have you ever
created any paintings with a protective theme?"

It took Luo Shan twenty to thirty minutes to reply to this message: "Not
yet. Failed."

*If you haven't, then why did you fail? This answer is too
contradictory...* Jenna's pupils suddenly froze.
