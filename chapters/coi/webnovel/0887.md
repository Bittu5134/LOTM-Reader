## Chapter 887: The Function of the Lucky Coins

Lumian roughly understood the meaning of Madam Magician's words.

The water he had previously taken from the Samaritan Woman's Spring and
the soil from the area of the Dream Festival ancient tomb did have a
reward, which was another lucky coin. However, the one giving the reward
needed to wait until all of that water and soil had been used up and the
effects confirmed before actually paying. Using these items needed to be
done in batches, with time intervals between uses, rather than consuming
them all at once---which might actually lead to unfavorable results.

"We still need to wait a few more days?" Lumian cast his gaze towards
the golden-red tinted horizon and nodded gently, "I understand."

He wasn't impatient. Having been arranged for so long already, a few
more days didn't matter.

Lumian probed further, "How many lucky coins need to be gathered in
total to awaken Mr. Fool?"

"The lucky coins are tools, mediums, not the awakening itself. There are
only five such coins in total," Madam Magician answered clearly, no
longer speaking in riddles. "Once you get the last lucky coin, the five
of you will be able to use your respective coins to enter Mr. Fool's
dream and attempt to awaken him. Understand? The lucky coins are mediums
to help you participate in Mr. Fool's dream.

"Of course, given your Sequences, even with the lucky coins, you can't
decide when you can enter that dream or what you can do once inside.
We'll need to assist you to ensure you can all go at the same time and
maintain sufficient clarity and rationality."

Lumian listened quietly, his eyes slightly turning as he pursed his lips
lightly.

"Mr. Fool's dream? We're responsible for awakening Mr. Fool?"

"Yes," Madam Magician answered with just one word.

She surveyed Lumian's profile, which took on a dreamlike beauty in the
twilight glow, and inwardly sighed.

Lumian furrowed his brow slightly. "What do we need to do to awaken Mr.
Fool? Haven't the previous holders of the lucky coins entered Mr. Fool's
dream before? Haven't they made any attempts?"

*Why does it have to be us?*

"I don't know exactly what needs to be done to awaken Mr. Fool," Madam
Magician said very frankly. "That's for you to figure out. We'll give
you some suggestions based on your feedback."

She paused, then said in a teasing tone, "The previous holders of the
lucky coins did indeed enter Mr. Fool's dream and made quite a few
attempts, but they were successively discovered by that Celestial
Worthy's spirit, either kicked out of the dream or had their actions
restricted, unable to do much. One of them, after being kicked out of
the dream the first time, would be kicked out again within a minute of
re-entering the dream, regardless of whether they disguised themselves
or behaved.

"You need to be careful too. The early stages are fine, but if you're
later discovered and locked onto by that Celestial Worthy's spirit,
you'll also be kicked out of the dream, or become mute, blind, or
foolish."

After pondering for a moment, Lumian asked, "Are we the destined ones to
awaken Mr. Fool?"

"Perhaps, perhaps not. We can't be sure yet," Madam Magician explained
simply. "We can only say that the previous holders of the lucky coins
would suddenly feel at some moment or in some scenario that they should
trade away the lucky coin to someone else. This might be a hint from
fate."

Lumian didn't ask any more questions. Instead, he mentioned that he now
met all the conditions to come into contact with Omebella's remains, and
finally asked, "Can I apply to the New City of Silver now?"

"I'll help you inform Mr. Sun. You just need to be prepared," Madam
Magician said with a laugh. "Of course, you won't be able to actually
take away Omebella's remains. That belongs to the New City of Silver.
Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts are extremely precious anywhere. No one will
gift it to you without appropriate compensation.

"What you'll be allowed to do is to review the relevant records of the
City of Silver, come into contact with and study the item that the
remains have become within the New City of Silver. If you encounter
difficulties, with the approval of the New City of Silver's six-member
council, you may be able to borrow that Grade 0 Sealed Artifact for a
short time, to be returned within a certain period."

"That's already very good," Lumian said sincerely.

According to 007, an official Beyonder, even to use a Grade 1 Sealed
Artifact, he had to submit a report in advance, obtain approval, and
meet the corresponding conditions. As for Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts, that
was something he couldn't even dream of.

And now, the New City of Silver might actually allow him to borrow
Omebella's remains for a period of time!

Lumian "habitually" smoothed his hair and told Madam Magician about
Termiboros's, that is, Amon's true form's reaction when he first learned
that the name of the Great Mother's Invisible Child of God was Omebella,
along with his own speculations.

"This might indeed hide a very big and important secret, with some
connection to that bird egg deep in the Underworld and the missing
Madame Night Pualis," Madam Magician said, slightly raising both hands
as if feeling the freshness and vigor of the early spring wheat
seedlings.

Lumian stopped in front of a pond used for water storage and after a few
seconds of silence, asked, "Madam, what is the true purpose and final
result of Project Vortex?"

Madam Magician recounted in detail all the transactions and developments
she understood, but because Lumian no longer had a false Angel status
and had lost Mr. Fool's seal, unable to bear certain knowledge, she
uniformly used descriptions like the evil gods outside the barrier, the
one worshiped by the Brokers, and the Great Mother to refer to those
great existences.

Upon hearing that Emperor Roselle had been resurrected as the Black
Emperor, and then chose to die again to severely damage the great
existence preaching in the name of "Truth", Lumian's expression changed
several times, but in the end, he didn't say a word.

"I understand how you feel," Madam Magician comforted her feminized
Minor Arcana card in a self-mocking tone. "I don't like that individual,
and I really dislike His methods, but I have to admit, He is indeed
preparing for our world to face the apocalypse, not just doing things
that only benefit Him under the guise of a banner. So my feelings are
very torn."

Lumian's expression remained cold, maintaining his silence.

Madam Magician didn't continue discussing this matter. She raised her
right hand, letting points of starlight appear and fall towards Lumian's
left chest, forming an illusory symbol composed of layers upon layers of
doors.

This Major Arcana card holder said simply, "Since there's no need to
seal an Angel, my power alone is enough to simply protect Aurore and the
others' soul fragments. We don't need to trouble Mr. Fool, and besides,
if Mr. Fool were to seal it, it might actually affect the gradual
revival of Aurore's soul fragments through your female state.

"Well, if you're unwilling to take the lucky coin into Mr. Fool's dream,
we won't force you. I'll still help reinforce the seal periodically."

Lumian smiled bitterly. "That individual has already made the choice for
me."

He remained silent for a while, his slightly paler lips moving a few
times.

"Can being in the Demoness state really allow Aurore's soul fragments to
gradually revive? Is this truly the only way to resurrect Aurore?"

"It may not be the only way. At least, I can't give you an accurate
judgment. Only Mr. Fool could provide the corresponding answer," Madam
Magician neither denied nor confirmed that individual's statement.

Her current knowledge and abilities were not sufficient to support her
refutation.

The only thing she could be certain of was: "This is indeed a way to
resurrect Aurore, just that the final resurrection won't be completely
whole."

"Why must it be Aurore's soul fragments gradually reviving, and not the
soul fragments of other villagers? There are many soul fragments sealed
within me, why is Aurore the most special one?" This was now Lumian's
greatest concern.

Madam Magician said, "Aurore's soul fragments simultaneously meet three
conditions. First, she was a Beyonder, having undergone the
transformation of Beyonder characteristics on her spirit. Second, she
was corrupted by Inevitability powers. Third, at the end of the ritual,
her soul fragments received protection from that individual or several
ones, so they're in relatively better condition, the kind that can
gradually revive.

"Therefore, her soul fragments are indeed the most special among all the
soul fragments within you. The remaining soul fragments might only be
able to exist in the form of half-human, half-object puppet soldiers
when you become an Angel of the Hunter pathway in the future."

Lumian thought for a while and said, "If I were now a Beyonder of those
three pathways of the Great Mother, I wouldn't doubt that Aurore's soul
fragments could gradually revive within me, but a Demoness doesn't have
the symbol of new life..."

"But the Demoness has the authority of resurrection. Have you forgotten
that one of the descriptions of the Demoness of Unaging is that she's
bizarrely hard to kill, skilled in resurrection and rebirth?" Madam
Magician reminded him.

Lumian quietly exhaled and said, "If I continue to advance to become a
Demoness of Unaging, would the revival effect of Aurore's soul fragments
be better?"

Madam Magician smiled and said, "There's no need to deliberately pursue
that. When you later jump to Sequence 2 of the Demoness pathway, you'll
similarly gain all the abilities and characteristics of the Demoness of
Unaging, unless you find a way to separate out the corresponding Unaging
Beyonder characteristic yourself."

Seeing Lumian nod slightly, Madam Magician smiled and asked, "As a
demigod who has switched pathways, you should have some special, mixed
abilities now, right?"

Lumian offered a curt acknowledgment and said, "The most special ability
is the application of fire.

"On the one hand, I can use a Hunter's blazing-white flames and the
Demoness's inherent black flames separately. On the other hand, I can
fuse them together for an explosive effect. This can both physically
destroy human bodies and objects, and ignite spirituality, burning
spiritual bodies, comprehensively damaging and destroying a target.

"Yes, after the fusion of the Demoness of Despair Beyonder
characteristic and the Hunter pathway Beyonder characteristic, new
mystical knowledge appeared, calling this black flame that suppresses
irritability and madness the 'Fire of Destruction'."
