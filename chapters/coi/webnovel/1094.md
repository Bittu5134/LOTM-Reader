## Chapter 1094: Trap?

In Quartier de la Maison d'Opéra, on Rue du Chapeau Noir, inside an
apartment with drawn curtains.

Niceea, with her curly brown hair pulled up, wearing an off-shoulder
black dress and a thin gauze shawl, placed the makeup mirror given by
her immediate superior on the cabinet in front of her and patiently
waited for feedback.

After about twenty to thirty seconds, she saw a human figure quickly
traced within the mirror, stepping out.

The person had slightly blackened, somewhat flaxen-colored long hair
tied into a spirited ponytail, eyebrows extending dynamically into the
temples, and lake-blue eyes that were slightly deeper than before, with
an added soul-attracting depth amid their bright and crystal-clear
appearance.

"When did Louis Gustav disappear?" Franca's red and pretty lips moved.

Although she had become a Demoness of Pleasure, Niceea was still dazzled
by her superior's beauty, temperament, and charm, her heart
involuntarily stirring.

She unconsciously compared Madame Franca with the Demoness of Black she
had seen before, discovering that she didn't like to change her
temperament much, always trying to find the most attractive side for her
conversation partner, remaining straightforward and natural.

It was precisely this casual and natural state that made Madame Franca
uniquely charming. Combined with her nonchalant expression and
high-ranking status, Niceea occasionally felt she wanted to prostrate
herself at her feet, body and soul.

After spending some time controlling the ripples in her heart, Niceea
reported in detail, "Louis Gustav arranged to meet several core members
of the Emperor Party, including Grouès, in a secret mine in Underground
Trier yesterday to discuss discreetly developing members within the
army. As a result, everyone arrived, but he did not appear.

"From yesterday until now, Grouès and others have tried various methods
to contact him, but have received no response."

Niceea was now not only Grouèss mistress but had also gradually become a
person close to the core of the Emperor Party due to her talent in
instigation, provocation, and seduction.

*It seems Louis Gustav had truly met with an accident, not just being
delayed, but considered missing...* Franca thought and asked,
"Has anything unusual happened within the Emperor Party recently?"

Niceea shook her head. "In recent months, whether it's the Eternal
Blazing Sun Church, the God of Steam and Machinery Church, Bureau 8, or
the military, they have significantly increased the number of official
Beyonders stationed in Trier. Madame, you might find it hard to believe,
but the patrols in Underground Trier are now led by Sequence 5
Beyonders, team after team.

"In the first two months, the Emperor Party was still making small
moves, resulting in many secret members being exposed, suffering
significant losses. Recently, they have been well-behaved, only covertly
developing and expanding.

"Previously, Louis Gustav and Grouès often met, knew each other's
residences, and would occasionally discuss matters at fixed cafes. But
after nearly being caught by official Beyonders from the Bureau 8, Louis
Gustav moved from his original residence and carefully commanded core
members remotely."

*So that's how it is... No wonder it sounds different from before, when
Grouès and others used to know Louis Gustav's daily routine...*
Franca slightly nodded and told Niceea, "This matter is significant. I
will first report to the Demoness of Black.

"Stand by for new orders at any time."

"Yes, Madame Franca!" As soon as Niceea finished speaking, she saw her
superior's figure gradually fade, transforming from solid to virtual,
quickly disappearing as if never having been present.

Only the lingering faint fragrance in the air and a hint of what seemed
like machine oil indicated someone had been there.

___

In the luxurious villa.

Franca ended her mirror projection maintenance and turned to Lumian.

"Ever since you advanced to Weather Warlock, I now see everything as a
trap. Niceea's report could be a trap from the Demoness Sect, and Louis
Gustav's disappearance might be a trap from the Mirror People.

"Never mind. I'll report to the Demoness of Black, saying the matter is
significant and requesting her personal handling.

"If I don't get involved, I won't fall into the trap!"

In the Demoness Sect, Franca was still nominally a Demoness of Despair
and a subordinate of the Demoness of Black, though of course, the truth
couldn't be hidden from the Primordial Demoness.

"Is this what you call upward management?" Lumian chuckled, "If it's a
trap, the Demoness of Black certainly won't let you shirk
responsibility. If it's not a trap, she should still have you conduct a
concurrent investigation."

"Sigh, I know," Franca sighed, "I was just venting my emotions. What if
the Demoness of Black actually goes to investigate herself? People,
after all, must live with hope and anticipation."

Lumian glanced at Franca. "I feel that you'll maintain your humanity
quite well in the future."

"Why suddenly talk about humanity? Are you troubled by godhood?" Franca
keenly countered.

After speaking, she took out a makeup mirror and verbally formed the
information about Louis Gustav's disappearance and Niceea's detailed
report, transmitting it through the mirror world to the mirror
designated by the Demoness of Black---she would avoid meeting the
Demoness of Black whenever possible to prevent stepping into a trap.

After Franca finished this matter, Lumian briefly explained Mr. Fool's
interpretation of godhood and humanity, and his own state of being.

Franca was enlightened. "So that's why you suddenly proposed
hugging---you were somewhat unable to control the aggregation instinct
and destruction desire?"

"No, because I had already hugged Jenna, I felt it should be fair,"
Lumian said in a low laugh.

"..." Franca's mouth twitched slightly.

Lumian casually added another sentence, "What you said also had some
influence."

Franca hummed in response and suddenly burst into laughter.

"What's so funny?" Lumian found it strange.

Franca cleared her throat and replied, "As a fellow hometown native,
I've always supported your sister's creative work and read many of her
novels. Some descriptions are really cringy. There's one line that goes
something like: 'He hugged me tightly, very forcefully, as if afraid of
losing me, wanting to crush me and tuck me into his body.'

"My goodness, this isn't a cringy description, it's clearly a horror
description, so realistic!"

Seeing Franca wasn't too frightened and even joking, Lumian's inner
pressure seemed to diminish. He naturally discussed his sister's works.

"Aurora deliberately intensified the cringe. She says Intisians love
this style.

"By the way, did those works exist in the old era?"

Franca gently shook her head in response. "You could say the story
concepts and ideas are similar, but without being a Savant, how could
one exactly reproduce them? Moreover, your sister integrated current
social trends and folk culture, making it an entirely different work.
It's not like just because someone previously wrote about
transmigration, me writing about transmigration makes it plagiarism?"

"I see..." Lumian was very satisfied with this answer.

At this moment, the Demoness of Black responded to Franca through the
mirror: "Find effective clues as soon as possible."

"Yes, Madame." Franca responded, making a face at Lumian.

After pondering for a few seconds, she sent a new order to Niceea:
"Search for clues, try to find Louis Gustav's current residence.

"Preferably obtain some items closely related to Louis Gustav and bring
them to me."

This way, Franca could perform Magic Mirror Divination and even seek
guidance from Mr. Fool.

After she finished issuing the command, Lumian laughed and asked, "Still
doing that sword-riding thing?"

Franca's spirits lifted. "Of course!"

She then seemed to have a moment of reflection, muttering to herself,
"The apocalypse is near. We must cherish daily happiness and
satisfaction.

"We can't abandon today's life because of some dangerous things we'll
have to do later."

"Hmm..." Lumian slowly nodded.

___

One week later, at midnight.

Niceea silently slid off the bed, stood upright, and merged into the
darkness.

She glanced at the muscular middle-aged man on the bed, naked and only
partially covered by a blanket, for a few seconds before leaving the
bedroom soundlessly and entering the room in the furthest corner of the
second floor.

Then, she took out a special makeup mirror, used the spell given by her
superior, and sent information to the designated mirror.

She knew reporting at this hour would disturb Madame Franca's rest, but
the situation was urgent. If she waited until dawn, Grouès would take
back those two items, so she had no choice.

Shortly after, Franca's figure was projected from the makeup mirror.

She wore a silk nightgown with a thin outer jacket for cover, her
slightly black flaxen-colored long hair cascading down, her expression
unabashedly lazy and drowsy, her lake-colored eyes slightly deeper and
hazy.

Niceea was stunned, only awakening when Franca spoke. "What is it?"

Niceea came to her senses. "Madame, I've obtained two items closely
related to Louis Gustav.

"These were found in one of his previous secret hideouts."

As she spoke, Niceea raised her hands.

In one hand, she held a silver brooch made of two intertwined snakes; in
the other, she held a dark gold coin.

Seeing the latter, Franca suddenly became alert.

She used invisible spider silk to pull the coin before her.

One side of the gold coin was quite simple, with raised patterns forming
a chariot, bearing the number "2". The other side had a considerably
complex pattern.

The main body was a crowned figure with a hanging cloak. To the left of
the crown was a sketched, layered gate; to the right was a clock face
with only one hand, its grid sizes unequal, with light and dark
intertwining.

Parallel to the crown on the layer below were tiny flower pattern
elements: a vertical pupil, five fingers of varying lengths, and a door
split by a vertical long sword.

*A Tudor coin...* Franca's pupils slightly dilated as she
recognized the item.

It was very similar to the Tudor coin they had obtained from the Sick
Church, but with a face value of "2".

The patterns and details were essentially the same between the two
coins, but their expressions differed significantly.
