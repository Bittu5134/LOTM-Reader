## Chapter 633: West Balam

Lumian had heard from Lugano that ships deviating from the safe sea
route might mysteriously disappear. In a few years, they would
occasionally appear at night---with no lights or people.

This seemed to be the case now.

In the past, Lumian might have teleported over out of curiosity, taking
advantage of the three-masted sailboat's reentry into a safe sea route
to assess its internal condition. However, after encountering the Demon
legends on Hanth Island, he felt that less curiosity was better. As long
as the uninhabited ship traveling in the darkness didn't exhibit signs
of attack or an imminent danger, he could treat it as a unique spectacle
of the Berserk Sea and simply observe.

The brown ship gradually distanced itself, leaving only the billowing
sails in its wake.

Abruptly, Lumian, utilizing his exceptional vision, spotted a face
silently staring out of an open hole in the cabin's uppermost window.

The face, shriveled and pale-white, clung tightly to the bones, devoid
of flesh and blood. Flaxen-colored hair cascaded like withered weeds.
The eyeballs were absent, leaving only a void of deep darkness.

It resembled the head of a desiccated corpse, yet its lips were
surprisingly vibrant, as if recently adorned with lipstick.

Lumian instinctively sensed the face belonged to a woman. At least, she
had been a woman when alive.

He refrained from raising his right hand for a warm greeting. Instead,
he quietly observed as the ancient three-masted sailboat sailed beyond
the safe sea route and into the dark night. The desiccated face, with
blood-red lips and pitch-black eyes, blended into the darkness.

Only then did Lumian wave his hand and offer a faint smile.

"Goodbye! You won't be missed!"

He then helped Franca and the others to devise a plan to confront Moran
Avigny. Ultimately, he opted to await further information from 007
before finalizing their strategy.

Conspirer wasn't a visionary, known for conjuring conspiracies out of
thin air; they required substantial information as a foundation.

When Lumian awoke at dawn, the Berries emerged from the dense,
death-carrying fog of the Berserk Sea.

Before him stretched a clear blue sea, bathed in the intense sunlight of
the high sky.

The next day, the Berries bypassed Behrens Harbor at the northernmost
tip of West Balam. Instead, they continued southwest, reaching Port
Pylos by 4 p.m.

Situated in Matani, the port was under the rule of Admiral Querarill.

Originally a colony of the Intis Republic, Port Pylos saw Intis
colonists withdraw after the war a few years ago. Subsequently, various
factions from the Feynapotter Kingdom, maintaining a favorable
relationship with Admiral Querarill, took control.

Lumian's target, Hisoka, was yet to surface in Port Pylos, but Lumian
knew that the two pranks he had engaged in were in Matani. One occurred
in Tizamo Town, at the outskirts of Port Pylos, closest to the forest,
and the other in Devise, the southernmost gold mine city in Matani.

As Lumian unbuttoned the second button on his linen shirt, he remarked
to Lugano in a self-deprecating tone,

"I feel like I'm shunned by winter and have been living in a scorching
environment."

Having arrived in Port Santa during late autumn, which was relatively
hot and sunny, Lumian moved on to Port Colla as Port Santa began to
cool. His journey continued through what his sister called the tropics,
devoid of winter and maintaining a temperature of at least around 20
degrees Celsius.

While Trier was already in midwinter, the Southern Continent was
experiencing the height of summer.

This made Lumian's specially prepared black tweed coat and
Gehrman-styled trench coat impractical.

"Because we've been traveling south all autumn," Lugano declared
authoritatively on matters of weather and seasons.

Lumian donned a golden straw hat and strolled down the gangway to the
port, hand in hand with Ludwig.

He boldly embodied the traits of the adventurer Louis Berry.

Initially, Lumian had contemplated altering his strategy, adopting a new
identity to discreetly investigate the two pranks in Matani and uncover
Hisoka without drawing attention. However, after Franca vividly detailed
Hisoka's usual characteristics to Anthony Reid, the Hypnotist's
profiling revealed an exceptionally aggressive trait, ranking among the
top.

As a result, Lumian reconsidered and returned to his role of casting out
"bait."

Yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that success was a slim possibility.
The sea sacrificial ritual and Loki's survival had likely provided
Hisoka with a comprehensive understanding of the factions backing him.
April Fool's, with its former display of resources and energy, seemed
ill-equipped to challenge the might of the Tarot Club. And Lumian wasn't
solely relying on the Tarot Club for support.

If he were in Hisoka's shoes, Lumian would opt for patience. He'd wait a
month or two, allowing the vengeful enemy to grow restless and make
mistakes. When the formidable forces behind him could no longer
guarantee protection, he'd launch a surprise attack.

*For now, let's not devise a plan. I'll consider it when I find
clues*, Lumian muttered to himself. Leaving the port alongside a
throng of passengers, he reached the public carriage stop.

Numerous rental carriages and pitch-black or vermilion coffins were
parked nearby.

*Coffins?* Despite having read many travelog books on West
Balam's customs, Lumian found it absurd to witness coffins lining the
roadside.

Before the invasion of the Northern Continent, before East and West
Balam's division, the Balam Empire revered Death---the Emperor of the
Underworld from the War of the Four Emperors. Thus, the locals valued
and loved coffins, considering them objects that brought peace,
tranquility, and the blessing of Death. When traveling, they would lie
inside, carried by people or pulled by horses and single-horned goats.

Of course, this form of transportation was reserved for those of a
certain wealth level. Ordinary people couldn't even afford lying in a
coffin.

After a momentary daze, Lumian addressed Lugano and Ludwig with
interest, "Do you want to take the coffin? I plan to give it a try."

"I-I'll pass," Lugano replied, finding the idea of lying in a coffin
unsettling.

Ludwig shifted his attention to the nearby street vendors.

The aroma of corn and potatoes intertwined, enticing every passerby and
prompting increased saliva production.

"How lame," Lumian teased with a smile. Approaching the four locals with
disheveled black hair and dark brown skin, he raised his right hand and
pointed at the pitch-black coffin beneath the shade of a tree.

"How much?" Lugano inquired in fluent Dutanese before Lumian could.

His linguistic talent was evident. Less than a month had passed since
their departure from Port Santa to their arrival at Port Pylos, and he
could already communicate with people in Dutanese. Of course, his
proficiency was limited to basic words and short sentences.

A half-naked local in linen pants replied in Dutanese,

"Nearby, 40 coppet; faraway, 1 verl d'or."

Recognizing the foreigner's inquiry, he refrained from quoting the price
in the local currency, Delexi, the Intisian term for copper coins.

*Quite affordable. This coffin, carried by four people, should be
considerably cheaper than the one carried by eight... *Lumian
mused, appreciating the direct use of verl d'or and coppet. It showcased
the recent Intisian influence in the former colony, lost only a few
years ago. Lumian's grasp of Dutanese surpassed Lugano's, thanks to the
mid-level Language Comprehension charm he had used on the ship.

Learning Dutanese in this manner proved more efficient.

Regarding charm consumption, Lumian harbored no concerns. In his view,
items served a purpose, and there was no concept of waste as long as
they proved useful. He couldn't align with those miserly individuals who
hoarded their wealth throughout life, only for it to benefit others
after their demise. If he urgently needed Language Comprehension charms,
he could acquire them from the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society. If
their gathering didn't align with his schedule, teleporting to various
cities in Lenburg would allow him to purchase them from the Church of
Knowledge.

"Sure," Lumian nodded at Lugano and said, "Let's go to Hotel Orella."

After Lugano paid 1 verl d'or, the local who had quoted the price lifted
the thin coffin lid, revealing the interior covered with thick dark-red
cloth and a stiff neck pillow.

Excitedly, Lumian removed his golden straw hat and lay down, immediately
feeling a cooling sensation enveloping his body.

In the hot season, the coffin effectively dispelled the humidity.

*Is it the coffin's wood or the sun-screening black paint, or perhaps
the shade of the tree? It feels like stepping into a morgue in the
summer---surprisingly comfortable...* Lumian observed the thin
coffin lid closing, witnessing the shadows rapidly expanding until they
dominated his world.

Outside, the voices became muffled in his ears.

The coffin was lifted, swaying slightly as it moved forward.

Within Lumian's view, everything was dark, and his surroundings exuded a
sinister, cold ambiance. For some reason, it felt like he was walking
toward death, touching it.

*Setting aside the psychological discomfort, it isn't bad. The only
downside is the tendency to easily fall asleep...* Lumian
evaluated the mode of transportation in a good mood. *It's unsuitable
for mixed-gender rides, which could be more awkward. Heh heh, I wonder
if the "romantic" Intisians have ever engaged in an affair under such
circumstances?*

Nearly half an hour later, the coffin halted in front of Hotel Orella.

Lumian stepped out, finding himself in front of a small, man-made
valley.

Rows of grayish-black stone rooms encircled the inner wall of the "deep
valley" until reaching the bottom.

This was Port Pylos's most renowned Hotel Orella.

Originally belonging to a Balam royal family descendant, Orella Eggers,
it had been constructed with the intent of approaching death. Later, it
fell into the hands of Intis colonists.

Upon the Feynapotterians' arrival, they perceived it as a symbol of
entering the earth and returning to the land, prompting its
transformation into a sizable hotel.
