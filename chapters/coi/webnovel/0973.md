## Chapter 973: An Unexpected Visitor

When Lumian arrived at the administrative department, several
professionals were already there collecting physical evidence for
analysis, including but not limited to leftover milk tea, liquid from
the water dispenser, discarded takeout containers, vomit, and swabs from
computers, desks, and air conditioning vents...

After they finished, another group of specialists began a full
disinfection process.

During this time, Luo Shan and the other administrative staff who were
still working could only wait in the hallway.

At a glance, Lumian noticed that besides Mr. Ed and Luo Shan, only two
people seemed unaffected by the mystical pathogen. Their complexion and
movements appeared quite normal.

One was a male, relatively tall by Yangdu standards, standing over six
feet. The other was a woman in her thirties, with a round face, slightly
overweight, not particularly attractive but not ugly either.

*They don't seem to be after Mr. Huang... or rather, not after Mr.
Huang's body... Why would Beyonders work diligently in the Intis Group's
administrative department?* Lumian tried to fathom their
intentions based on his own thinking.

Of course, he couldn't be certain that there weren't any Beyonders among
those who went to Crimson Moon Hospital. Perhaps there was a Demoness
waiting for a chance to have a taste of Mr. Huang, but upon sensing the
presence and erosion of the mystical pathogen, she feigned severe
symptoms and went to the hospital to avoid being discovered?

Luo Shan also noticed the reportedly handsome security guard and felt he
lived up to her expectations.

After a while, Mr. Ed received a phone call.

"The problems aren't serious, and the situation has stabilized?" Mr. Ed
asked happily.

Then he heard Zhang Qing on the other end say: "The test results show a
mild viral infection. The doctor said they can go home after finishing
their IV drips, take medication for two more days, rest a bit, and
they'll be fine.

"More than a dozen people have already applied for sick leave, planning
to stay home for a couple of days to recover. They're also asking if
this counts as a work-related injury and if there's any compensation."

Mr. Ed's temple twitched as he suppressed his emotions and said, "They
should rest at home. We can't have them forcing themselves to work and
risking more serious problems. As for whether it counts as a
work-related injury, ask the legal department when you get back."

"Alright," Zhang Qing said, "But there are also more than a dozen people
who say they want to come back to work, however..."

"However what?" Mr. Ed asked.

Zhang Qing replied ambiguously, "They're all the ones who like to dress
up, except for Luo Fu."

Even sick beauties were beauties---Mr. Huang might feel sympathetic when
he saw them.

Mr. Ed was momentarily speechless.

*Is it only the new employees who are eager to work and take their jobs
seriously?*

Meanwhile, Lumian used the incident in the administrative department as
an excuse to keep watch nearby, occasionally offering help.

This was also to guard against Luo Shan being eliminated by the
Celestial Worthy's subordinates in the chaos---as a Painter, she had
some ability to protect herself, but she clearly lacked experience and
could easily let her guard down in crowded situations. Now, with Franca
in the hospital, she couldn't rely on Mirror Substitution to escape a
first strike.

After Franca returned from Crimson Moon Hospital to help Luo Shan and
others deal with the backlog of work, Lumian and Old Xia went back to
the security department on the thirteenth floor.

He continued to ponder how to treat An Xiaotian.

He believed that An Xiaotian becoming a vegetable was symbolic,
representing the decline and disappearance of Antigonus's spiritual
imprint within The Fool's Uniqueness. This couldn't be reversed through
normal methods, so he had to seek a solution from the essence.

*Find a way to strengthen Antigonus's spiritual imprint within The
Fool's Uniqueness? But Antigonus can't enter Mr. Fool's dream now. Even
if He's willing to provide the corresponding items, we'd have to corrupt
Zhou Mingrui, the symbol of The Fool's Uniqueness, to achieve our goal.
This would damage our image in Zhou Mingrui's mind, wasting all our
previous efforts, and it's extremely dangerous.*

*Franca and Jenna's approach isn't wrong. Using the power of the Great
Mother might awaken An Xiaotian, but it's not treatment or having An
Xiaotian have a child. It's new birth, symbolically meaning that
Antigonus's spiritual imprint within The Fool's Uniqueness is reborn.
Whether the reborn An Xiaotian is a friend or foe is hard to say, but he
would inevitably interfere with Mr. Fool's awakening...*

*Sequence 7 Heretic Spellmaster of the Villain pathway can perform
rebirth rituals. Theoretically, Great Mother bestowed like Grimm can
wake An Xiaotian, but it involves reversing symbolism. I estimate only a
rebirth ritual performed by someone with godhood would be effective. In
the dream city, Grimm and others believe only I, the fake Child of God,
have this, while others don't. Well, there should be another place that
has it, the basement of Mushu Hospital, but sending An Xiaotian there
would be purely creating an enemy for ourselves...*

After pondering for a long time, Lumian felt that both current
approaches had significant problems. The hidden dangers and negative
impacts far outweighed the gains, and it wasn't something he and his
companions would choose.

He began to consider this matter from the perspective of finding
loopholes.

Soon, he thought of someone: Li Keji!

*Mr. Fool's subconscious understanding of Li Keji's mushrooms should
come from Gehrman Sparrow's interactions with Frank Lee.*

*From what we've seen, he seems to think Li Keji's mushrooms are quite
dangerous, with various possibilities, producing some incredible
effects.*

*The essence of this city is a dream, and dreams are idealistic. As long
as Mr. Fool truly believes Li Keji's mushrooms can achieve incredible
things, Li Keji could create a mushroom to treat An Xiaotian and wake
him up!*

*It's not the mushroom treating An Xiaotian, but Mr. Fool's subconscious
being guided to reverse the symbolism.*

*Of course, that awakening would inevitably be distorted, abnormal, and
horrifying, but if An Xiaotian could use this to say everything he wants
to warn me, it would be acceptable...* The more Lumian thought
about it, the more he felt that using Li Keji might be useful.

He planned to find an opportunity to talk with Li Keji through the door
of the hospital room.

The original of this biology teacher was really a Doctor!

Jenna, who was observing other incarnations corresponding to Mr. Fool,
received a call from Hall Film Company, asking her to head over to the
talent department tomorrow to sign a manager contract.

*Phew... I have a job now too.* Jenna breathed a sigh of relief.

She even looked forward to filming movies and TV dramas but felt that
the matter of awakening Mr. Fool wouldn't drag on that long, not until
she joined a production.

At the same time, she felt that Hall Film Company was managed quite
well. She had thought some interviewer would call in advance, hinting
that she needed to do something to have a chance at a good contract.

She was prepared to use Charm to make the relevant personnel lose
themselves, but nothing happened.

This was different from some things she had seen and heard at the
Théâtre de l'Ancienne Cage à Pigeons.

*As expected of a film company founded by Madam Justice...*
Jenna felt relieved.

After dark.

Lumian, who knew the target's schedule, took advantage of Zaratulstra's
absence from the hotel to cross over from the mirror world and retrieve
the surveillance content stored in the pinhole cameras and listening
devices.

After midnight, he returned to the rented apartment in Xinhong District
and used his phone to play back Zaratulstra's activities in the hotel
room.

This wasn't to spy on what Zaratulstra was plotting or planning to
accomplish---though that would be a bonus. Lumian's main purpose was to
observe Zaratulstra's behavior when alone, to find out how many
marionettes he could currently maintain, how often he summoned
Historical Void images, how long these images would dissipate on their
own, and other such information.

This was preparation for an upcoming surprise attack and encirclement to
kill Zaratulstra.

Although Zaratulstra was also suppressed to Sequence 7, he still had an
Angel's rank. Many of his abilities' effects and ranges were somewhat
different from a true Sequence 7.

Take the number of marionettes, for example. A normal Marionettist who
had just advanced to Sequence 5 could only control one marionette. If
restricted to Sequence 7 level, theoretically, they wouldn't be able to
control marionettes at all, only using marionettization for killing. But
this ability might qualitatively change at Sequence 4 and Sequence 2,
reducing spirituality consumption and lowering control difficulty. After
that, even if the ability was suppressed to Sequence 7, it would still
essentially exist, just with less pronounced effects.

In other words, Zaratulstra could still control marionettes, but the
number was very limited---perhaps two, perhaps only one. Lumian now
needed to confirm these details.

Without grasping the relevant intelligence, if they directly launched a
surprise attack and tried to encircle and kill Zaratulstra, given their
superior numbers, they might have some hope of defeating or forcing him
to retreat. But achieving their predetermined goal would be almost
impossible. The Seer pathway was known for its strong survival
abilities!

Lumian stared intently at the phone screen, not missing any detail.

For now, he was skipping through, selecting only scenes with human
activity.

When the surveillance video reached 11 pm last night, Lumian saw
Zaratulstra, dressed in a black robe, walk to the door and open it.

Someone entered from outside.

The person wore sunglasses even at night, dressed in a black T-shirt and
dark jeans that wouldn't attract attention, about six feet tall.

*Who could it be?* Lumian's focus intensified.

After entering the room, the person looked left and right, then removed
the sunglasses perched on their nose, revealing a face quite familiar to
Lumian.

He had seen videos of this person being interviewed and participating in
certain activities online.

It was Jia Yu, the actor who played Gehrman Sparrow!

*He doesn't look too much like Zhou Mingrui, which shouldn't be a
problem, so why is he visiting Zaratulstra late at night? What have we
missed?* Lumian's pupils dilated as he watched more intently.

He was grateful for the technology that provided him with assistance,
but also worried that Zaratulstra might have already discovered the
presence of the pinhole cameras and listening devices, deliberately
staging this scene.

Jia Yu sat down in the sofa area and talked with Zaratulstra for nearly
fifteen minutes, then stood up and left.

Lumian quickly stopped playing the surveillance video, deciding to first
listen to whether the listening device had recorded any dialog during
that time period.
