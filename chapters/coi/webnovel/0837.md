## Chapter 837: Each With Their Own Schemes

Lumian did not directly teleport behind Albus Medici, nor did he
approach the fragmented corpse of the monster Guei. Instead, his figure
quickly materialized at the edge of the peak area.

Earlier, while observing the battle from the mountain's base, he had
already stopped the knowledge recitation from the brass talisman made by
Archbishop Heraberg and removed the corresponding earplugs, placing them
in the Traveler's Bag. This was out of concern that the upcoming intense
battle might cause devastating damage to them.

Similarly, he wore the Mirror Cufflink on his cuff, preparing to use it.

As soon as Lumian appeared at the mountain peak, he saw the pus flowing
from Guei's corpse fragments seep into the bodies and bones forming the
ground, igniting nearly invisible and colorless flames.

Those flames instantly engulfed Guei's dismembered body, burning it to
ashes, giving no chance for it to writhe and grow.

At the same time, Lumian noticed that the almost invisible remnant
flames that had existed at the peak had mostly extinguished, with the
remaining ones about to burn out completely.

He had also noticed earlier from the mountain base that the scattered
remnant flames on the wasteland were successively extinguishing.

Of course, this did not affect the illumination of the corpse mountain
and its surrounding areas. Light came from the purple fiery glow seeping
through the massive vortex high in the sky, from the corpses, bones, and
different parts of the wasteland ignited during the battle between Albus
Medici, Celeste, and the monster Guei, and from the charred banner that
was shaking and vibrating with increasing frequency.

*The original remnant flames are extinguishing? Were they not always
present, but rather created by 0-01 in response to the appearance of
Hand Bro, a being with godhood?* As this thought struck Lumian,
he gripped the ordinary straight sword resembling the Sword of Courage
with both hands and ran towards Albus Medici, who was about a dozen
meters away.

With a whoosh, the straight sword burst into blazing-white flames.

Albus, with his brow mark vivid and seemingly about to drip, bent down,
letting his hands touch the corpses and bones forming the mountain.

The flesh of some corpses suddenly melted, becoming viscous, while bones
rapidly gathered.

Albus then straightened up, forcibly pulling from the corpse-and-bone
ground a huge white sword temporarily formed from countless spines and
neck bones, with melted viscous flesh entwined around it, bringing a
bloody and bizarre appearance.

Albus dragged this bizarrely shaped, horrifying giant sword to meet
Lumian.

*Crack!* The giant sword of bones protruding through waxy flesh
split Lumian's blazing white flame sword in two with a single strike.

Lumian's figure vanished, rapidly reappearing behind Albus.

He swiftly drew another iron-black straight sword resembling the Sword
of Courage from the Traveler's Bag and struck heavily at the neck of
this Medici family member before him.

Albus swiftly turned, swinging his monstrous giant sword horizontally,
once again shattering Lumian's weapon.

Lumian teleported once more, again flashing behind his enemy.

But as soon as his figure began to materialize, sharp icy spears
condensed in mid-air, raining down like a storm.

Celeste, who had concealed herself and circled to an unknown location,
launched an area attack targeting both Albus and Lumian.

Lumian then saw dense fog.

It surged out from around Albus, instantly enveloping the area, reducing
visibility to ten meters and preventing Lumian from sensing spirit world
coordinates beyond the fog, making it difficult to directly teleport
out.

Fog of War!

Immediately after, Albus, now out of Lumian and Celeste's sight, pressed
a layered, compressed, yet still massive blue fireball towards the
ground of the corpse mountain.

*Boom!*

A terrifying explosion that temporarily deafened swept across the area,
dispersing the dense Fog of War, vaporizing the falling icy spears,
destroying part of the corpses and bones, and igniting others.

Almost simultaneously, Lumian's figure was reflected in the black
breastplate of a corpse on the wasteland.

Earlier, when his teleportation was restricted, he had immediately taken
out a mirror from the Traveler's Bag and activated the Mirror Cufflink
on his left cuff.

Using this Beyonder item, Lumian had entered the mirror world just
before Albus created the indiscriminate explosion and the dense icy
spears fell, escaping from the peak of the corpse mountain.

This was similar to his choice when escaping from Albus and Gusain's
encirclement in that underground cavern filled with the fog of war.

Lumian jumped out of the smooth black metal breastplate, and the
glass-like ornament on his cuff instantly turned grayish-white,
crumbling into dust that scattered to the ground.

The Mirror Cufflink had been used for the last time.

At the peak of the corpse mountain, Albus had already turned and was
rushing towards the increasingly violently shaking 0-01.

At this point, Julie's pool of filthy blood was only about a meter away
from the surface of the charred banner.

Since Albus's battle with the monster Guei began, the blood no longer
felt as if it was being held up by an invisible hand and continued to
fall, albeit at an increasingly slower pace.

Seeing 0-01 within reach, a mirror of ice and snow, two to three people
tall, suddenly rose in front of Albus.

The mirror instantly reflected Albus's figure.

Similar ice mirrors abruptly appeared to Albus's sides and behind him,
reflecting different angles of this Red Angel descendant.

As these giant ice mirrors formed, thick, snake-like strands of
blackened hair emerged from the edge of the mountain, carrying the quiet
and eerie Demoness's black flames, rapidly extending towards those
mirrors.

Celeste intended to curse Albus with this!

Albus swiftly turned sideways, facing the source of those snake-like
black hairs, and saw Celeste, cloaked in a black robe with an oddly
flushed face.

*Boom!*

Multiple blazing white, blue-tinged fireballs quickly condensed,
shattering those four huge ice mirrors into pieces. However, these
fragments melted slowly, continuing to reflect Albus's image from
different angles, densely awaiting the arrival of the snake-like hairs
carrying the Demoness's flames.

Holding the bizarre giant sword, Albus suddenly transformed into a
blazing white, blue-tinged fire person, expanding to three to four
meters tall.

This brought continuous high temperatures, completely melting those ice
mirror fragments.

Silently, Celeste withdrew those long hairs covered in black flames,
once again concealing her form, moving to an unknown location.

Lumian teleported over.

This time, he drew the iron-black Sword of Courage from the Traveler's
Bag---the true Sword of Courage!

Enduring the continuous burning pain of sulfurous flames, Lumian was
instantly filled with courage.

*What's there to fear from just a Sequence 5 who can borrow some power
from the Red Angel?*

*Why hide?*

Lumian swung the Sword of Courage at Albus Medici, only igniting the
godhood-possessing straight sword with blazing white, blue-tinged flames
just before it was about to clash with Albus's bizarre bone and flesh
sword.

Having courage didn't mean not using schemes and tricks!

Albus's now iron-black eyes showed no surprise; instead, a smile curled
at the corners of his mouth.

His bizarre bone and flesh sword suddenly burst into near-blue flames.

*You've been pretending to be weak all along, only using ordinary
straight swords. How could I not be prepared for you to suddenly use a
godhood-possessing attack?*

Albus's body abruptly metallized, instantly boosting his strength to its
peak.

*Boom!*

The two swords collided, creating a sound like an exploding shell.

The blast of wind failed to shake Albus, whose skin now had an
iron-black tinge, pushing Lumian and his Sword of Courage back.

Suddenly, Lumian melted into a viscous black liquid that seemed to be
formed from the most sinister desires deep within the human heart.

He disintegrated on the ground, rapidly flowing to the bottom of Albus's
feet, covering him like a shadow.

*Crack!* The illusory, viscous, chilling black liquid suddenly
dispersed, and a mirror tinged with silvery-black fell onto the corpses
and bones, shattering into pieces.

*Mirror Substitution?* Lumian was shocked.

*Albus has Mirror Substitution too?*

*No, he hadn't used it in several dangerous situations before!*

Albus's figure emerged from a mirror near the peak of the corpse
mountain, smiling as he transformed into a blazing-white, blue-tinged
flame spear, flying back to the battlefield---that mirror was a remnant
of Celeste's Mirror Maze.

He didn't have Mirror Substitution, but he could still traverse the
mirror world using the crystal necklace coiled around his wrist. During
Lumian's first attack, he had prepared a mirror in advance, hiding it at
his waist under his tattered jacket.

*The indescribable monster appeared so abruptly and strangely, pursuing
you. How could I not be prepared for you in this aspect?*

*As for how to quickly escape combat without Mirror Substitution and
avoid being affected, you've demonstrated it twice already!*

Seeing the flame spear flying towards him, Lumian, still in his viscous
black liquid state, immediately seeped into the gaps between the corpses
and bones, using this to leave the mountain peak.

Filled with courage, he didn't intend to flee. To avoid being trapped by
the Fog of War again without the Mirror Cufflink, he planned to circle
around to the other side, seeking new opportunities to corrupt Albus
Medici.

Fleeing was definitely not an option!

At this moment, Lumian suddenly felt a rather intense weakness.

*Has my spirituality dried up prematurely? No, it's not just a matter of
spirituality...* Lumian thought as he reverted to human form and
released his accumulated spirituality.

*Clang!*

His right hand inexplicably lost strength, making it difficult to hold
onto the Sword of Courage. He could only watch helplessly as the
iron-black straight sword fell to the ground, clanging against a stark
white skeleton.

*Why didn't I teleport to create distance first?*

*I... I seem to be sick...*

Lumian was suddenly alarmed and immediately activated the black mark on
his right shoulder, disappearing from near the peak of the corpse
mountain.

He left the Sword of Courage there, not retrieving it for the moment.

He was hoping the opponent would trigger one of its negative
effects---in about ten minutes, if the Sword of Courage wasn't sealed
away, it would indiscriminately attack nearby people.

And now, the people around the Sword of Courage were Albus Medici and
Celeste.

As soon as Lumian's figure materialized on the wasteland, Albus at the
peak of the corpse mountain slightly furrowed his brow.

This descendant of the Red Angel swayed slightly, noticeably weaker than
before.

He seemed to have fallen ill as well.
