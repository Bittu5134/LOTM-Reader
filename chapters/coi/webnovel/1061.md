## Chapter 1061: Feast

In an apartment with insufficient lighting, the classic clock's hands
ticked away.

Lumian, Franca, Jenna, and Anthony were gathered around a corpse,
watching Ludwig tie a white napkin around his neck.

"He's quite well-mannered..." Lumian quipped.

The corpse in the room belonged to the remaining Sequence 4 demigod from
the Sick Church in the Trier region, named Sathipo Eir. Previously
controlled by Mr. Fool, he had recently completed the task of making his
followers pray to the God of Plague and God of Disease. Then, Lumian
received a revelation from Mr. Fool, instructing them to come to this
apartment at the current time to handle the subsequent matters.

As soon as Lumian and the others knocked on the door, they saw Sathipo
Eir collapse and die in front of everyone.

Fortunately, Lumian had already pulled this apartment and all its
contents into the mirror world, and had Anthony quickly place the Winter
is Coming pistol on the corpse.

Thinking about Sathipo Eir, who had been busily helping himself and
Franca connect with followers and spread new doctrines and was
essentially Mr. Fool's avatar, Lumian felt something was off.

*Isn't it strange that the god he believed in would go to such lengths,
meticulously and diligently running around to recruit followers, preach
doctrines, and spread his honorific name?*

*Would a great existence be so hands-on?*

Recalling the stories about Amon that Madam Magician had told him and
the abilities of high-ranking Beyonders from the Marauder and Seer
pathways, Lumian thought this seemed somewhat normal: A thousand
avatars, all of which are oneself!

"Can I eat now?" Ludwig raised his head, looking eagerly at Lumian.

"Should we first channel the spirit?" Lumian turned his head and asked
Franca.

Although Mr. Fool had certainly grasped all of Sathipo's information
through Parasitism, Lumian felt that they should still channel the
spirit. They couldn't always trouble Mr. Fool with everything.

Franca looked at Sathipo's floating spirit and pondered, "The decay is
slower than expected. Mr. Fool must have done some processing. Let's not
rush to channel his spirit. Do we know what to ask?"

Jenna chimed in, "We might as well search the apartment first and see
what clues we can find. Then we can channel his spirit, which will help
us know exactly what to ask."

"Okay," Lumian said, seeing many green and yellow light points had
settled on Anthony's Winter is Coming revolver. He smiled at Ludwig, "Go
ahead."

He had previously asked Ludwig if returning to Sequence 4, or Sea
Monster, would cause him to transform into a grotesquely sized sea
monster, which would make it impossible for him to stay in Trier unless
he constantly hid in the mirror world.

Ludwig had looked at his hands and body for a few seconds and
unexpectedly became sad, crying, "Not yet."

He was clearly disappointed.

He told Lumian that his appearance shouldn't change much, but he would
need to be taken to the ocean daily to have a proper feast---something
easy for Lumian, who had teleportation abilities.

With the godfather's approval, Ludwig cheered and lunged at the corpse.

Franca and Jenna instinctively turned their backs.

Amid sounds of tearing, chewing, cracking, and crunching, the two
Demonesses began examining every corner of the apartment.

Mechanical music boxes, classic clocks, fabric sofas, red desks, brass
gas meters, and exquisite small statues passed before Franca and Jenna's
eyes.

Suddenly, Franca walked to the desk and opened a drawer.

Inside were various denominations of gold coins, including several 20
Louis d'or coins.

Franca's hand moved through the coins, picking up a coin with a dark
gold, less lustrous color.

It was a gold coin, but not of any current legal tender.

Franca brought the dark gold coin close to her eyes, noticing a male
head profile on the front, with long hair, wearing a crown, with rigid
lips and sharp facial lines.

On either side of the male head were layered doors and a raven with one
eye large and one small, surrounded by changing lines, a vertical sword,
and an extended hand.

*Hmm...* Franca had a vague guess.

She turned the coin over, finding a number "7" on the back.

Around the "7" were images of gathered soldiers, sharp weapons, and
flowing blood.

"Is this a Tudor coin?" Franca spoke aloud.

Her spiritual intuition told her so.

The Tudor dynasty of the Fourth Epoch had issued its own currency, but
perhaps due to the Blood Emperor's mental state or influence from the
original pathway, its value and conversion were perplexing---unlike the
normal 1, 5, 10, 20, but with seemingly random values like 2, 7, and 13.

These coins had long since disappeared over a thousand or two thousand
years, either remelted into new coins or gold items, or buried in
ancient tombs. Currently, one could only see them in museums or some
collectors' vaults.

"How could there be a Tudor coin?" Jenna looked over.

"I'm also puzzled. You can't even use this thing. Were they planning to
sell it as an antique?" Franca pondered for a few seconds. "We'll ask
during the spirit channeling."

While the two Demonesses carefully searched the apartment, Lumian
suddenly said to Anthony, "You can pick up the revolver now."

He intuitively believed that Winter is Coming had reached its limit in
bearing the bestowed power, and continuing might damage it.

Of course, no matter how damaged, it would still be a weapon with
Beyonder power, though the negative effects might change and become
unbearable.

Anthony, who had already quietly cast Placate on himself, squatted down
and picked up the artistic Winter is Coming revolver from the bloody,
mutilated corpse.

"The Certain Death and Sure Hit charges have been enhanced to nine
times...

"Even if this revolver shatters, it can be reassembled...

"No other changes..."

Lumian used Magic Mirror Divination to inform Anthony about the current
state of Winter is Coming.

Anthony, who had received a Traveler's Bag as a bonus from the dream
mission, breathed a sigh of relief and placed the revolver inside.

At that moment, they heard a loud, prolonged "burp".

It came from Ludwig.

Ludwig had only eaten half the corpse and seemed already full.

He sat there, with what felt like a mass of air in his stomach,
occasionally distending his belly and causing crackling sounds in his
chest.

Beneath his facial skin, countless insects writhed, creating multiple
bumps.

At this moment, Lumian and the others distinctly felt that a terrifying
beast was about to tear through Ludwig's skin.

Ludwig's body alternately stretched tall, causing skin cracks, and then
swelled, nearly bursting his clothing.

After ten to twenty seconds, his state finally stabilized, still looking
like the same seven or eight-year-old boy.

*The Church of Knowledge's seal is indeed of high quality...*
Lumian thought to himself.

Ludwig suddenly looked at him, his eyes filled with blood vessels and
desire. "I want to go to the sea, I want to eat!"

Lumian nodded, grabbed Ludwig's shoulder, and disappeared from the room.

Somewhere in the Fog Sea.

Lumian's figure took shape in mid-air, throwing Ludwig toward the blue
sea surface.

Ludwig didn't mind at all, already opening his mouth while still in the
air.

That mouth kept opening wider, until eventually, his entire head and
body seemed to become part of the mouth, with sharp teeth reflecting the
brilliant sunlight.

With a splash, Ludwig fell into the sea.

Then, the seawater descended, and an inexplicable whirlpool appeared.

The whirlpool gradually expanded, and fish nearby involuntarily rushed
over, swimming toward its bottom.

These marine creatures numbered in the thousands, streaming endlessly.

Splash! The massive whirlpool's appearance triggered changes in this sea
area, with water currents becoming turbulent and massive waves rising in
the distance.

A large steam ship was passing near the sea's edge but appeared tiny
beneath the towering waves.

The passengers were frightened and scattered, with the captain ordering
the crew to change course immediately.

*Splash!* A huge wave approached.

But before it could truly arrive, it suddenly froze in mid-air.

It quickly disintegrated, each fragment like a snowflake or ice crystal,
beautiful under the sunlight.

In Sathipo's apartment, Franca performed the Magic Mirror Spirit
Channeling Spell.

Facing Sathipo's mirror image, she directly showed the Tudor coin.
"Where did this come from?"

Since Sathipo had been Parasitized by Mr. Fool and his faith Grafted,
she didn't need to worry about any corruption from divining this Sick
Church demigod.

Sathipo's pale face responded mechanically, "A gift from God."

*A gift from God... Wait, where did your god get a Tudor coin? This is
within the barrier...* Franca pressed, "Through what method was
it given?"

Sathipo responded at a steady pace, "First, the great Malady God gave a
revelation, telling us to wait before a mirror. Then, the coin fell out
from inside the mirror."

*Look at this, does this look like a gift from the Malady God? If you
said it was from the Primordial Demoness, I might believe it... From
what we know, the Malady God doesn't have authority over the mirror
world...* Franca asked again, "Besides you, who else has one?"

"Mocoxidos," Sathipo answered.

*We hadn't found it back then... Well, Mocoxidos had used his rotting
power to decompose himself into pathogens; everything on his body should
have rotted away and disintegrated...* Franca asked several more
questions but couldn't get useful answers.

Sathipo didn't know what the Malady God wanted to do, only that he was
instructed to wait patiently in Trier.

At this moment, Lumian returned with a soaking wet Ludwig.

"Ate about ten to twenty tons of fish and shrimp. Can't afford to feed
him, can't afford to feed him," Lumian said, clicking his tongue.

Having just become a Sea Monster, his appetite had already instantly
changed by orders of magnitude!

Franca echoed the sentiment, then told Lumian the spirit channeling
results, adding, "Since it wasn't directly given by the Malady God, we
can divine where this Tudor coin came from."

Lumian nodded, taking the coin.

Being cautious about matters involving great existences, he specially
sought Mr. Fool's observation and help before performing Magic Mirror
Divination to inquire his own spiritual intuition, "Who was the previous
owner of this coin...

"Who was the previous owner of this coin..."

Soon, the mirror's surface rippled with water, becoming profound.

In the next second, Lumian saw a pair of eyes, eyes so dark they were
without light.

*Wh---* Lumian blurted out, calling a name in a deep voice,
"Zarathushtra!"
