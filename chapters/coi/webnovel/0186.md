## Chapter 186: Strange Footprints

Holding an iron-black carbide lamp, Franca glanced at the path between
stone pillars and asked the smuggler, Fernandez, who was leading the
way, in a state of confusion, "Doesn't this lead to Quartier de
l'Observatoire?"

Though Underground Trier was a complex maze, the tunnels on this level
had street names corresponding to the surface. After pondering for a
moment, Franca realized they were going in the wrong direction.

Smuggling operations certainly entailed entering the city from its
outskirts, and Quartier de l'Observatoire was positioned closer to the
center of Trier compared to Le Marché du Quartier du Gentleman. The
district stood on the other side of the Srenzo River, effectively
separating it from Avenue du Boulevard.

Fernandez, a smuggler associated with "Rat" Christo, turned around with
a smile and explained, "The hidden route we're taking leads to Quartier
de l'Observatoire. We always deliver the goods to the warehouse there."

"Is that so?" Franca slowed down and increased the distance between
herself and Fernandez, who wore a brown felt hat.

Since they hadn't entered the smuggling route yet, she lowered her voice
and conversed with Lumian.

"I remember you traded your Pugilist Beyonder characteristic for 18,000
verl d'or with Gardner. You know it's a Beyonder characteristic, right?
Or rather, do you grasp a Beyonder characteristic's true meaning?"

"My sister mentioned it before." Lumian attributed his knowledge to
Aurore.

Franca was tall and had long legs, making it effortless for her to keep
up with Lumian.

Overwhelmed with emotion, she sighed and commented, "It's fortunate to
have someone to guide you. In the past, we were stumbling around like
blind mice, relying on ourselves to figure things out. Otherwise, I
wouldn't have made the choice..."

Her voice trailed off, ending with a long sigh.

This reminded Lumian of a saying, either spoken by Aurore herself or
relayed from Emperor Roselle's famous words: "Once you make a grave
mistake, it will haunt you for a lifetime."

Franca quickly regained her composure and whispered to Lumian, "You've
just entered the field of mysticism. Apart from knowledge, you're
lacking much more.

"It's best not to be frugal with that sum of money. Use it to purchase a
mystical item or a Beyonder weapon to compensate for a Hunter's
limitations in mysticism. Otherwise, if 'Black Scorpion' Roger truly
seeks revenge against you, he won't need to go through much trouble. He
can simply summon a few undead to hunt you down. If you have such
intentions, I'll keep an eye out for you."

Lumian chuckled.

"I've already made a purchase."

"So quickly?" Franca nearly lost control of her voice, causing smuggler
Fernandez to glance back.

The carbide lamps cast intersecting shadows, obstructing Lumian's view
of Fernandez's expression. He couldn't discern what thoughts they
triggered.

Lumian replied "honestly," "Before joining the Savoie Mob, I discovered
a circle of Beyonders through Psychic's gathering of mysticism
enthusiasts. There, I exchanged the verl d'or that the Boss gave me for
a mystical item."

"No wonder..." Franca revealed a knowing expression and praised Lumian.
"Your mind is even sharper than I imagined. Hmm, is it an item that
enhances your mysticism abilities?"

Lumian spoke frankly, "A pair of Lawyer glasses, but they seem to have
been tainted by some strange power."

As he spoke, he retrieved his brown Mystery Prying Glasses and showcased
them. "They allow me to see things I usually can't..."

Franca's brow furrowed ever so slightly as she interrupted Lumian.
"That's highly dangerous."

"I know," Lumian explained with a smile. "But as long as I choose the
right environment and take precautions, it won't be too risky. Besides,
it offers excellent disguises and mysticism techniques..."

Lumian briefly recounted his urge to paint after donning the Mystery
Prying Glasses.

Franca's ponytail bobbed behind her head.

"It's certainly useful. If I were in your shoes, I'd make the same
choice.

"Only the leaders and thugs of the Poison Spur Mob haven't really
interacted with you. They only know you by your peculiar hair color.
Otherwise, they would have recognized your true identity by now. They
wouldn't have needed to act themselves. They could have sought revenge
by sharing your information and wanted posters with the police
headquarters and the two cathedrals."

Lumian chuckled.

"That's right. I can already set up a coffee meeting with Officer
Everett."

Franca's vibrant lake-like eyes sparkled as she said, "You've shared so
much with me about the mysticism gathering and your trump cards. Jenna
even kept telling me how cunning and deceptive you are. Yet, you're
truly sincere and straightforward! Of course, our relationship is
different from others. I knew it. Muggle's brother isn't that kind of
person!"

For a moment, Lumian felt a twinge of guilt. He spoke sincerely, "Yes,
she completely misunderstood me."

After chatting for a while, they finally reached the outskirts of
Quartier de l'Observatoire's underground area and turned into a
southward tunnel.

Soon, Fernandez halted in front of a secondary well belonging to an
abandoned quarry.

He positioned the carbide lamp at the mouth of the well and gestured
downward.

"Let's go in."

With the aid of the blue light, Lumian peered down into the depths of
the well. It had been neglected for a long time and appeared to be
completely blocked by gravel.

Using the recess in the well wall, ropes concealed in the shadows, and a
basic iron ladder fastened to the moss, the three of them descended and
swiftly reached the well's bottom.

Fernandez moved a few seemingly heavy rocks, revealing a narrow tunnel
at the well's edge, wide enough for one person.

As they traversed the tunnel, which emitted a foul stench, the
passageway ahead widened, as if they had entered another section of the
quarry cave.

The air grew eerily still and darkness enveloped them. The cave ceiling
was damp, with scarce traces of moss.

Lumian and Franca, each holding a carbide lamp, slowed their pace and
meticulously examined the various signs along the smuggling route.

After an indeterminate amount of time, Fernandez pointed to a nearby
tunnel.

"Our boss and Baron Brignais weren't entirely fruitless. They discovered
that the caravan's tracks vanished into thin air over there."

It was a tunnel connecting two sections of the quarry cave. The path was
strewn with rubble and potholes. In the distance, darkness prevailed,
devoid of any light.

Lumian and Franca swiftly located the relatively fresh footprints that
had abruptly vanished. They squatted down, closely examining them.

"Only footprints going in. The ones coming back end right here. Most
people returning carry heavy loads. Their footprints are deeper,
distinctly different from when they came... We can rule out the
possibility of them turning around and retracing their steps..." Lumian
swiftly made a series of deductions.

Franca averted her gaze from her surroundings and stood up.

"No signs of a struggle. It's incredibly peculiar!"

She then motioned for Fernandez to move further away and wait in the
quarry cave.

As Fernandez's carbide lamp glow faded into the distance, Franca
produced a small makeup box and a white handkerchief with a blue
checkered pattern.

The handkerchief belonged to "Rat" Christo's brother, Erkin, who had
also gone missing during the smuggling operation.

Franca placed the carbide lamp down, opened the light-gold box, and ran
her fingers over the mirror inside.

Meanwhile, holding the handkerchief, she repeated in a whisper, "Erkin's
current whereabouts, Erkin's current whereabouts..."

The already dim tunnel grew even more stifling. The light from the two
carbide lamps was pushed back by an invisible force, and the palm-sized
mirror emitted a watery glow, as though revealing the depths of a dark
river.

Before Lumian could count to three, a scene materialized on the mirror's
surface.

Laborers lugging wooden crates and smugglers armed with revolvers and
rifles trudged through the tunnel. As they progressed, the darkness
behind them engulfed the space where the light had receded. Eventually,
the carbide lamp's glow vanished from view, and the mirror's surface
turned pitch-black.

"They did vanish in this area." Franca ended her divination, her thin
red lips pressed together. "But I can't discern anything further."

Lumian didn't suggest trying the Mystery Prying Glasses. From his
perspective, Trier's underground was a treacherous place, concealing all
manner of secrets. There were ruins from the Fourth Epoch, foul-smelling
old bones, catacombs with specific rules to follow, and the lingering
Montsouris ghost that had defied eradication for years. They were all
elements that instilled fear in those seeking the truth. If he were to
use the Mystery Prying Glasses to survey the surroundings, there was a
high chance he would explode on the spot.

In due time, Trier's underground would boast another legend entwined
with the power of an evil god.

Therefore, Lumian would lend a hand out of consideration for the Savoie
Mob's boss, but he wouldn't go all out and take unnecessary risks.

After all, it was "Rat" Christo who suffered the loss. What did it have
to do with him, "Lion" Ciel?

Salle de Bal Brise still had an abundant supply of alcohol!

Franca glanced at him, not intending to make things difficult.

Red Boots stowed away the makeup box and Erkin's handkerchief, picked up
the carbide lamp, and said to Lumian,

"Let's return and find Fernandez. Let him guide us forward. Perhaps
there are other clues left behind."

"Alright." Lumian felt that Franca was merely fulfilling her duty as a
member of the Savoie Mob.

The two turned around, carrying their carbide lamps, and ventured back
toward the original quarry cave, plunging into the ever-deepening
darkness.

After taking a dozen steps, Lumian abruptly halted, his expression
growing grave.

"What's the matter?" Franca asked, perplexed.

Lumian's voice resonated with gravity as he directed her attention to
the scattered rubble and pockmarked ground.

"No more footprints. The smugglers' tracks from their departure and our
own as we crossed have vanished! But there's a trail of footprints
carrying a heavy load leading forward!"

Franca's heart skipped a beat. She peered ahead, coming to the
realization that the ground lay in disarray. The footprints left by her,
Lumian, and Fernandez in the tunnel had vanished, replaced by the sudden
reappearance of the missing caravan's tracks out of thin air!
