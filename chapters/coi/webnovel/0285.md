## Chapter 285: Maxim

*The Blood Emperor's remains, the remains of a deity... Does it hold the
Beyonder characteristic of Sequence 0? No wonder the Iron and Blood
Cross Order dreams of entering Fourth Epoch Trier...*

*But what's this got to do with me? As a Sequence 7, I don't even dare
think about becoming a demigod. Advancing to a Sequence 6 Conspirer is
beyond my consideration for now. All I can focus on is digesting the
Pyromaniac potion. I've got nothing better to do than contemplate
High-Sequences or deity-related items!*

*Besides, Madam Magician warned that such items always come with
negative effects. Tsk, negative effects involving godhood can easily
kill me...*

Lumian, with vast knowledge of high-end mysticism, remained unfazed by
Gardner Martin's provocation. Thoughts raced through his mind, and he
sneered inwardly.

Looking at Gardner Martin, he asked innocently, "If Fourth Epoch Trier
truly contains the remains of The Blood Emperor Tudor, why didn't the
Eternal Blazing Sun and God of Steam and Machinery Church take it away
instead of leaving it for our Iron and Blood Cross Order?

"Even if only Hunters can enter safely, it's just a matter of time
before they nurture a High-Sequence Hunter with the resources they have.
The Fifth Epoch has been around for over 1,300 years."

Gardner Martin fell silent for two seconds before responding, "There are
other factors restraining them, but they won't be a problem for us.

"I'll tell you all the details once we find the entrance to Fourth Epoch
Trier."

*Isn't that just saying, "I don't know why, but we have to give it a
try?" Uh, maybe the Boss knows the reason, but he's afraid of scaring us
if he reveals it. He can't directly tell the present members that there
are many dangers hidden underground that even deities can't
resolve---the kind that requires rebuilding a Trier above the Fourth
Epoch ruins as a seal. That's why the two Churches won't attempt to
enter. Heh heh, who would dare to go underground when they're not
seriously corrupted? *Lumian tried his best to control his gaze
and posture, so as not to show any air of superiority.

Compared to the members of the Iron and Blood Cross Order here, him
having a rough understanding of the underground situation and having
seen the Invisible Sea of Fire, the Tree of Shadow, and the bizarre
catacombs indeed made him qualified to be superior.

Of course, he had no idea how well Commanding Officer Gardner Martin and
Supervisor Olson knew about the underground situation.

Perhaps the latter, suspected to have entered Fourth Epoch Trier, knew
more secrets.

Gardner Martin didn't continue discussing the Blood Emperor and the
Fourth Epoch. Instead, he turned to Lumian and asked, "Is there anything
you need these days?"

*Oh, are you about to hand out the membership perks?* Lumian's
spirits lifted as he replied with sincerity, "I'm in need of a mystical
item with peculiar properties to compensate for my deficiencies in
Beyonder powers.

"And if there are no relevant mystical items available, perhaps you
could provide me with the corresponding Beyonder... ingredients. I'll
try to find an Artisan to craft them."

He had almost mentioned the term "Beyonder characteristics" but quickly
changed it to "Beyonder ingredients" after a pause, feigning
embarrassment.

Though people often spoke of Beyonder characteristics at Trier's
mysticism gathering, they usually referred to the fusion of two main
potion ingredients.

Of course, some people had long discovered that Beyonders were also
Beyonder creatures, capable of producing ingredients for potion
concoction, hinting at the Law of Beyonder Characteristics
Indestructibility.

Typically, Lumian's mention of Beyonder characteristics wouldn't attract
suspicion or attention, but he needed to be cautious not to arouse
suspicion from a Conspirer like Gardner Martin.

"Heh, you really dare to ask?" Albus mocked Lumian, shaking his feet
with crossed legs.

Even Parsifal, Vincent Lorraine, and the others wore strange
expressions.

None of them had dared to make such a bold request when they joined the
Iron and Blood Cross Order.

Undeterred, Lumian sneered back at Albus, "Why not? I'm not like some
piece of trash who can't handle a reward. What the organization gives me
today, I'll repay tenfold in the future!"

With a whoosh, Albus lowered his right leg and glared at Lumian with
fiery intensity, clearly displeased with his response.

The others, except for Faustino who maintained his butler demeanor, also
showed discontent.

Lumian's snide remark had included them as well.

"Enough," Gardner Martin intervened, smiling at Lumian. "As the
Commanding Officer, I must be fair. I can't grant you a mystical item
right now, as others will protest. But don't worry; our Iron and Blood
Cross Order is not stingy. Once you complete a few missions and
accumulate enough merit, I'll provide you with a few mystical items to
choose from.

"Meanwhile, before each mission, suitable mystical items will be
temporarily provided to the participating members, ensuring their safety
and mission completion."

Lumian nodded, accepting the response. He hadn't expected much, but he
still made the request in case Gardner Martin was in a generous mood.

After a brief consideration, Gardner Martin added, "I'll inform René
that the advance you received was my reward to you. You'll still get
your share from Salle de Bal Brise in the future."

"Thank you, Commanding Officer," Lumian expressed his joy openly.

This meant his membership door gift was 12,000 verl d'or, a significant
sum.

Hence, most of the money he spent on advancing to Pyromaniac came from
the Aurora Order and the Iron and Blood Cross Order's "financing." His
gratitude was genuine, as he had only contributed less than a third of
the expenses himself.

Gardner Martin cut into a medium steak, chewing and swallowing before
asking, "Any other questions?"

Deliberately, Lumian inquired, "How can I quickly master the Pyromaniac
potion?"

He wanted to see if the acting method was common knowledge within the
Iron and Blood Cross Order.

Gardner Martin chuckled and replied, "That's an excellent question.

"To master a potion, you need to start with its name. Get close to it,
understand it, and embody it. In addition, I have to tell you a maxim:
flames can both incinerate others and harm yourself."

Lumian listened attentively and got a rough idea of the situation.

The Iron and Blood Cross Order kept the precise interpretation of the
acting method hidden from ordinary members, using vague descriptions,
regulations, warnings, and maxims to guide them without revealing
everything.

This approach allowed ordinary members to avoid certain risks while
gradually gaining insights by sticking close to the potion's name. They
could speed up their progress but couldn't fully grasp a more suitable
acting principle for themselves,

In other words, it was easier for them to "master" the potion than wild
Beyonders and advance in shorter periods. However, other than the
talented, those who stuck close to the acting requirements couldn't
compare to Beyonders who knew the acting method.

Lumian suspected that he would only learn the entire acting method once
he became an NCO and received greater attention from the Iron and Blood
Cross Order.

He believed that such a secretive organization spanning centuries must
possess the acting method.

In contrast, Madam Magician of the Tarot Club had already given him
extensive high-end mysticism knowledge, including the acting method.

As for Mr. K, Lumian was unsure if he had forgotten to teach the method
due to devotion to his prayers and work or if he believed Lumian would
naturally encounter it at the Iron and Blood Cross Order and exposing
him to this knowledge too early would put him at risk of exposure.

"Pyromaniac is all about setting fires! Just go to the National
Convention building and set it ablaze. You'll master the potion in no
time," Albus taunted Lumian, pushing the matter.

Lumian scoffed and replied, "I'm a Pyromaniac, not an Arsonist.
Meaningless acts of arson will only harm myself."

Albus sneered, "How do you know it's meaningless? Burning is the
meaning."

Lumian clicked his tongue.

"Then why don't I burn your hair too?"

After engaging each other for a while in an argumentative manner,
Gardner Martin intervened in the conversation, which was becoming
increasingly meaningless and close to a personal attack.

Lumian shifted the conversation to probe the Iron and Blood Cross
Order's knowledge of the underground.

"I went to the catacombs some time ago and sensed something amiss, but I
couldn't figure out what it was. Commanding Officer, do you know
anything about it?"

Gardner Martin glanced at Supervisor Olson beside him and finally
replied, "That has nothing to do with our actions. You don't need to
know.

"All I can say is that the danger lurking there is as serious as that in
the Fourth Epoch Trier."

Lumian nodded thoughtfully and continued asking questions while enjoying
the delicacies.

During the process, he noticed that Vincent Lorraine remained relatively
quiet, and Parsifal and "Blood Palm" Black were amiable but guarded with
their words, revealing little valuable information. Faustino seemed to
play the role of a butler instead of the secret organization's official
member.

Only the dark-red-haired Albus, despite his malicious and mocking
comments, gave Lumian some useful insights.

By 10 p.m., the initiation concluded, and Lumian was the last to leave
11 Rue des Fontaines, boarding the carriage belonging to Salle de Bal
Brise.

As the carriage moved, Lumian's heart skipped a beat as he looked up at
the seat opposite him. At some point in time, another person had joined
him---Supervisor Olson, who looked like a hungry bear.

The trader who played the underground monster!
