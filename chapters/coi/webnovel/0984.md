## Chapter 984: A Tranquil Night

Jenna's mind instantly tensed up. She decided to placate Lumina and not
give her the opportunity to go to Mushu Hospital, until Lumian returned
around 7 or 8 pm the next evening.

She looked at Lumina and said sincerely, "The investigation into the hot
pot restaurant shooting hasn't ended yet. If you go to Mushu Hospital,
you might be taken to the police station. Even if the police can prove
you're not related to Zaratulstra's death, it will take a considerable
amount of time. You'll be detained for at least a few days, which could
cause you to lose your job."

Hearing the phrase "lose your job", Lumina showed a not-so-obvious
expression of fear.

"Yes, I should hide for a couple of days. After that, going to work
disguised as a man shouldn't be a problem."

She had already been instilled with the setting of working as a security
guard while disguised as a man.

Jenna didn't dare to relax. She glanced at the curtains blocking the
bright moonlight and said to Lumina,

"We can't go to Mushu Hospital, but we can go to the rooftop to feel the
breeze and relax a bit."

"Okay," Lumina said, an uncontrollable smile appearing on her clean and
clear face.

Jenna first fixed the door lock, then took Lumina out of Room 2303 and
to the rooftop via the elevator and stairs.

Throughout the process, she hid a mirror in each hand, using them to
reflect light and create illusions to conceal herself and Lumina from
the surveillance cameras.

Feeling the cool breeze that had lost its scorching heat in the night,
Lumina half-closed her eyes and took two deep breaths.

She then walked to the parapet wall at the edge of the rooftop, pointed
at the top, and asked for Jenna's opinion, "Can I sit up there?"

"Normal people can't since it's very dangerous. But you're fine, your
sense of balance is very good, even better than acrobats," Jenna wasn't
afraid of Lumina falling. She had enough ability to rescue her, so she
wanted to see if the loophole hadn't been patched yet, and if by
constantly suggesting to Lumina that she had abilities beyond ordinary
people, whether Lumina would actually possess Beyonder powers.

Lumina put her hands on top of the parapet wall and lightly jumped up,
preparing to sit down.

Suddenly, her hand slipped, and she lost her balance, about to fall
towards the ground a hundred meters below.

At that moment, she felt several invisible ropes pulling at her, helping
her stabilize.

"Phew, that scared me to death..." She turned her body sideways, looked
at Jenna who was already sitting nearby, and patted her chest.

She thought Jenna had caught her.

Jenna, who had lightly wrapped Lumina with invisible spider silk for
protection, realized she had overlooked something.

This person was still under the negative effects of misfortune brought
by the Circle of Binding. Even if she had gained excellent balance based
on Jenna's suggestions, she would fail due to extreme bad luck.

"Be careful," Jenna specially cautioned.

Lumina responded tersely and nodded lightly.

She looked at the lit internal roads of the residential area below for a
few seconds, then raised her head, casting her gaze towards the bright
moon in the sky.

The moonlight and the city's light pollution had hidden the stars from
view.

Lumina supported herself with both hands on top of the parapet wall,
quietly looking at the moon, completely absorbed.

After an unknown amount of time, she suddenly said, as if talking to
herself, "A poem came to mind."

She didn't turn her head or look at Jenna, still gazing at the bright
moon in the sky.

"What poem?" Jenna was enjoying the current peace and tranquility.

Lumina maintained her contemplative posture and said in a slightly
ethereal voice, "Raising my head, I see the bright shining moon,

Bowing my head, I think of my hometown."

At the Police Department, in a certain meeting room, the lights were
still bright late at night.

Lun Xiande stood in front of the whiteboard, pointing at two photos and
said, "We can make a judgment that this case involves supernatural
powers. The killer, or rather the criminal group, can use mirrors and
the mirror world behind them."

One of the two photos was of the broken mirror in the changing room, and
the other was of the shattered window in the private room where the
victim was.

Officer Deng sat below, nodding lightly, indicating for Lun Xiande to
continue.

"Therefore, those who were not in the hot pot restaurant's main hall and
were not under surveillance during the corresponding time period are all
suspects and need further investigation.

"They likely went to surveillance blind spots, used mirrors they carried
with them to sneak back into the hot pot restaurant's main hall, waiting
for the victim to return from the mirror world. If the victim returned,
they would deliver a fatal blow. If not, it would mean their accomplices
had already succeeded."

Deng raised his hand, pointing out a flaw in Lun Xiande's reasoning.

"It's also possible that they were always lurking behind a mirror or a
glass window, not having appeared in the main hall of Shujin Hot Pot
Restaurant before.

"Judging from how well this group utilizes the mirror world, they didn't
need to send someone to the main hall of the hot pot restaurant in
advance to wait by eating hot pot. They could have waited until the time
was right, or received a signal, then entered the mirror world from
afar, arriving at the predetermined assassination location. Look, the
woman who walked out of the screen with Zaratulstra hadn't appeared in
the main hall before either."

After speaking, Deng raised his palm and sniffed the tobacco pressed in
his pipe.

"Yes," Lun Xiande admitted that the captain's point was valid. "But we
still need to re-investigate those who left the main hall of the hot pot
restaurant during that time period but weren't recorded by surveillance
cameras in the corresponding state at the time of the incident."

"Remove the latter condition," Deng thought for two seconds and said,
"People who can use the mirror world can also deceive surveillance
cameras. You should know that surveillance cameras record based on
optical principles, and those who master mirrors are good at affecting
light and creating optical illusions."

After Lun Xiande nodded, Deng turned to Li En and said, "Tell us about
the preliminary investigation results."

Li En stood up, taking Lun Xiande's place.

"So far, we've used dream interrogation on seventeen people without
letting them notice anything unusual.

"Luo Shan: Very surprised about Zaratulstra's death, couldn't believe
it.

"Zhou Mingrui: Very cautious about Zaratulstra, but also didn't
anticipate Zaratulstra's death.

"Luo Fu: She left the main hall at the time and went to the ladies'
room. There's no surveillance in the bathroom, but she was also very
surprised about Zaratulstra's death, clearly shocked.

"We initially listed these three as key investigation targets because
they're all employees of the Intis Group. They might have been
instructed by some powerful figures within the Intis Group who don't
want a merger and reorganization, to assassinate Zaratulstra at Shujin
Hot Pot Restaurant and disrupt the ongoing business negotiations. But
none of them knew that Huang Tao and Zaratulstra were also in Shujin Hot
Pot Restaurant, and Luo Shan and Zhou Mingrui never left the main
hall...

"The preliminary conclusion is that they don't have any issues."

Deng expressed agreement, and Lun Xiande didn't say anything.

After thoroughly discussing the case, Deng stood up and said to his
subordinates,

"Currently, there are two key points. First, investigate the remaining
suspects, including those mentioned by Lun Xiande and those with
substantial motives. Second, find the woman who walked out of the screen
with Zaratulstra. Although she didn't attack Zaratulstra at the time,
the fact that she came out of the screen itself is worth noting."

"Yes, Captain," Lun Xiande, Li En, and other officers stood up and
responded.

Deng smiled and said seriously, "This involves foreign guests and major
business activities. You've all worked hard. I'm going to report to
Chief Yagates now."

After looking at the moon and feeling the night breeze for half an hour,
Jenna took Lumina back to Room 2303.

"Rest now, your body hasn't fully recovered yet," Jenna said, pointing
to the bedroom.

Lumina, wearing her nightgown, opened the door and entered the bedroom.
She found that the sick Franca had also woken up at some point due to
her absence.

"Do you feel better now?" Franca had already learned from Jenna via
WeChat about what the two had done.

Lumina looked at Franca and nodded with complex emotions. "Much better."

Her emotions were complex because she remembered that Luo Fu and she
were also in a romantic relationship.

Yet this didn't affect her relationship with Jenna.

*I thought I was just an ordinary yuri fan... How did the yuri circle
become so messy? Am I really a player?* Lumina sat on the edge
of the bed and said to Franca,

"Let's sleep, I still have to work tomorrow."

Security guards worked in shifts.

Franca looked at Lumina and said with a smile, "Did you forget? You took
two days off, Friday and Saturday. Your director, Grimm, approved it."

Lumina blinked. "Oh, right... I forgot. No wonder I don't have to work
the middle shift today and can go directly to Shujin Hot Pot Restaurant
in the evening..."

Looking at Lumina like this, Franca suddenly felt she was a bit adorably
silly.

After the two in the bedroom went back to sleep, Jenna also lay down on
the sofa, closed her eyes, and entered deep sleep.

After a while, her Astral Projection arrived in Luo Shan's Shaman world.
She saw the girl still guarding by the translucent barrier, having
repelled a new round of attacks from the monsters.

From the corner of her eye, Jenna saw Franca's Astral Projection
wandering around in a daze like the other people around.

This indicated that Franca, due to her illness, had entered and then
exited her consciousness.

Next, Jenna also found Lumina's Astral Projection, who also lacked clear
consciousness.

"She really isn't a Beyonder..." Just as Jenna had this thought, she
suddenly realized something.

*Luo Shan must know!*

It was hard to hide from her in the Shaman's "domain".

The next second, Jenna saw Luo Shan half turn her body and say to her,
"So Zaratulstra was really killed by you guys."

Luo Shan had seen Lumina's Astral Projection, seen this beautiful woman
who had walked out of the screen with Zaratulstra.

"Yes, we didn't tell you earlier because we were worried the police
might have special methods to confirm whether you were lying," Jenna
explained.

Luo Shan asked in confusion, "Wasn't Luo Fu afraid of being caught
lying?"

"She was hypnotized in advance," Jenna didn't conceal.

Luo Shan fell silent. After several seconds, she asked in a low,
extremely difficult tone, "Is this... is this really a dream?"
