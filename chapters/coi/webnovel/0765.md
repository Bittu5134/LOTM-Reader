## Chapter 765: Howl

Lumian thought for a moment and then specifically reminded, "Don't
forget the Four of Swords."

To be honest, he almost overlooked Anthony's presence, but because he
was constantly thinking about what his teammates were doing and how to
coordinate with them, he didn't forget entirely.

When he invited the two Demonesses to Chaban Street at St. Millom
Restaurant, Lumian didn't think of Anthony right away. It was only when
he reached the street that he remembered their teammate. But he couldn't
find the Hypnotist, who had used Psychological Invisibility. He could
only trust that Anthony, with his rich experience, would realize that
once the rest of the team had gathered together, it was clear the next
actions weren't suited to splitting up, and he would follow.

Anthony's habits as an information broker combined well with
Psychological Invisibility.

After a two-second pause following Lumian's reminder, the Knight of
Swords said, "We won't forget."

*It seems like you already did... but the temperance faction's demigod
shouldn't be affected much by Anthony's Psychological Invisibility, so
when sending Franca and Jenna away, they shouldn't really forget about
Anthony... If that's the case, one major cause of death for a Hypnotist
would definitely be that Psychological Invisibility works too well,
causing teammates to forget or overlook them...* As Lumian mused
to himself, the special Paramita before him suddenly changed.

A deafening crash sounded from Lake Dalsh as gray-white water surged
upward like a tsunami, reaching into the air. The wilderness, already
intertwined with the city of Raklev, began to dominate. In an instant,
it crossed squares and streets, swallowing Lumian, who had not yet
reached Chaban Street, while avoiding Franca and the others.

Oxyto, blessed by the Great Mother, seemed to realize she had been
exposed.

Her choice was to use the nature of Paramita to temporarily separate the
blasphemer of the Child of God from the temperance faction's demigods,
then exploit the brief time difference to achieve her desired goal
regarding Lumian.

Almost simultaneously, Lumian, wearing the Eggers family's golden mask
and transformed into an undead, felt his body grow "heavier," as if cold
masses had taken residence inside him.

In the next second, he saw the indistinct human figures on Chaban Street
vanish, along with Franca, Jenna, Ludwig, Lugano, and possibly Anthony
behind him. It was as if they were in two separate worlds.

The human skulls in various states became increasingly distinct, their
eye sockets burning with pale or dark red flames as they all turned to
face Lumian.

At the end of Chaban Street, at the city's edge where it blended more
deeply with the wilderness, swaying figures crawled out from unknown
places and began walking toward Lumian.

There were rotting long-haired oxen with only a few pieces of pus-oozing
flesh left, giant birds with exposed bones flying low, pythons dragging
half-melted threads of flesh between their decaying tissues, and
monstrous hills made of multiple headless skeletons.

Human skulls from all corners of the city were also swiftly converging
on Chaban Street, floating in the air and covering the sky, blocking out
the pale, dim, and heatless "sunlight."

Lumian appeared stunned, as if he had encountered something terrifying,
or was like an undead creature facing a higher-ranked and more
terrifying kindred spirit. For a brief moment, he stood frozen, unable
to move.

Just then, a wretched howl, filled with pain, echoed from Lake Dalsh.

The terrifying and piercing sound was like a high-speed spinning drill
that bored directly into Lumian's soul. His vision went dark, and he
lost consciousness.

When Lumian regained his thoughts and awareness of his body, he found
himself midway along Chaban Street, accompanied by the Knight of Swords
Maric, who had appeared at some point, dressed in a black vest and white
shirt.

All around him, crystalline cold had frozen human skulls of varying
states in mid-air, on the ground, and on the surfaces of gray-white
stone buildings.

The surreal frozen scene stretched all the way to the wilderness on the
outskirts of the city.

In the staggering army of undead creatures, the rotting monsters shed
flesh onto the ground, leaving only bones---yellowed, brown, or bleached
white. The skeletal remains sank into the soil, and droplets of crimson
blood, not their own, oozed from the surface. Meanwhile, the wraiths and
evil spirits swelled like balloons and burst silently, turning into
strange dust.

Although Lumian didn't fully understand what was happening, two thoughts
sprang to mind:

*Have they all been cursed?*

*Even the fleshless bones were cursed to bleed?*

With that thought, Lumian couldn't help but raise his right hand and
wipe his nose.

He immediately noticed some blackened bloodstains on the back of his
hand.

This came from within his body, blood that had long since stopped
flowing.

In the banshee's wail just now, not only was his soul wounded, but his
undead body seemed to have suffered physical damage too. Some
capillaries had ruptured, causing the blackened blood to seep out.

*Terrifying...* Lumian had roughly figured out what had just
happened.

*Oxyto screamed from a distance, using the Banshee's Howl enhanced by
Paramita, and I instantly lost consciousness.*

*Did the temperance faction's demigods attach themselves to me as
wraiths before Paramita expanded, pulling me into Paramita right away?
Then, they took over my body and used their abilities to deal with the
swarming army of human skulls and undead?*

*The Knight of Swords also attached himself to me, which is why he's now
in Paramita?*

After grasping the recent encounter, Lumian had a clearer and more
accurate understanding of the terror of demigods: *Oxyto isn't even a
full Angel but just a Banshee's Howl knocked me unconscious, robbing me
of my ability to fight. It took me over ten seconds to wake up...
Without the presence of temperance faction demigods, those ten seconds
would have been more than enough for Oxyto to kill me ten times
over...*

*This isn't something a drawn demigod can compare to. Facing a real
demigod, if I don't seize the initiative, I won't even have the chance
to draw the Sword of Courage or use Desire Incarnation!*

*There's no time for the animated shadow to take the damage for me
unless I anticipate it in advance...*

With these thoughts swirling, Lumian regained control of his body.

Then, he heard the Knight of Swords, Maric, mutter softly, "Oxyto has
retreated. She should be near Lake Dalsh.

"We still don't know what kind of help she's seeking."

"Lake Dalsh?" Lumian asked in mild surprise.

*That serene, beautiful, sacred lake?*

*On second thought, it makes sense. All mining operations in the Raklev
region have avoided Lake Dalsh, leaving it entirely
unpolluted...*

The Knight of Swords surveyed the surroundings but didn't immediately
dash off into the wilderness toward Lake Dalsh.

He nodded slightly and said, "Lake Dalsh itself is special, connected to
the fallen Death. The establishment of this small spirit realm in the
Raklev region was made possible due to Lake Dalsh.

"That former Balam Empire official even used an Undying's skull from the
Church of Death and, using his Gatekeeper powers, opened a door to the
Underworld and fixed it onto the Undying's skull. This prevented it from
completely closing too quickly, allowing a bit of the Underworld's aura
to leak out."

"The skull of an Undying? Undying can die too?" Lumian instinctively
asked.

The Knight of Swords started walking towards the edge of the frozen
world.

He glanced at Lumian and said, "An Undying is only Sequence 4 in the
Death pathway. They can still die if killed."

*I see...* Lumian nodded almost imperceptibly.

The Knight of Swords continued, "The aura leaking from the Underworld,
the unique traits of the Undying's skull, and the special nature of Lake
Dalsh all worked together to sustain this spirit realm, drawing the
souls of dead creatures in the region and letting them gradually wither
away."

After listening, Lumian froze for a moment.

"You seem to know a lot about the local spirit realm..."

The Knight of Swords replied, "The Rose School of Thought ruled here for
over a thousand years. Apart from the uniqueness of Lake Dalsh,
everything else was long understood."

"Then why didn't you say so earlier?" Lumian blurted out.

*If you'd told me sooner, I might have guessed Oxyto's intentions
earlier!*

"We didn't initially connect Oxyto to the spirit realm, so that
intelligence wasn't included in the information," explained the Knight
of Swords. "After that, I answered whenever you asked, but didn't
elaborate. Speaking is also a desire that requires temperance."

"..." Lumian suddenly understood how Franca felt every time she heard
him say, "I'll have to start with the events at the Samaritan Women's
Spring, where Madame Hela and I..."

While talking, he and Maric reached the edge of the city, where the
frozen world met the desolate wilderness.

Lumian instinctively glanced at the thick layer of ice encasing the
gray-white buildings. Using the reflective surface, he was astonished to
see a blurry figure in each of his eyes.

One wore a small black bonnet and a court dress of the same color; the
other had no head and was dressed in a dark, intricately patterned,
sinister gown.

Lumian then noticed translucent-ringed insects crawling in and out of
his mouth, yet he felt nothing.

___

At the entrance to Chaban Street, Franca, Jenna, and the others felt a
sudden chill engulf them and saw Lumian vanish before their eyes.

Before they could communicate or react, a voice, slightly magnetic and
ethereal like a dream, echoed in their ears: "I'll send you back to
Trier first."

Franca, Jenna, and Lugano instinctively turned their bodies and
discovered that a young-looking man had appeared next to them at some
point.

He wore a white shirt, draped in a thin black trench coat. With black
hair and green eyes, he had a night-like, handsome quality, and wore a
pair of red gloves on both hands.
