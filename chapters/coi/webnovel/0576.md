## Chapter 576: Palace

Having transformed into Simon through a Seer pathway's Sealed Artifact,
Lato Guiaro observed the illusory starlight surrounding them, akin to
seawater caught in a vortex. It cascaded down, forming a massive funnel.

The origin of this vortex was the humanoid Sealed Artifact they had
"abducted" from the Eternal Blazing Sun Church!

After the exposure of the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society's
internal affairs and the consecutive deaths of Loki and I Know Someone,
one resurrected at the cost of a precious opportunity, while the other
met a permanent end. They adjusted their initial sea sacrifice plan and
activated a backup strategy to counter potential interference from the
Research Society.

According to the revived Loki's warning, Hela, the society's vice
president, had likely ascended to Sequence 4, reaching demigod status,
and switched from the Death pathway to the Evernight pathway. Depending
solely on Ultraman, Bard, and Mad Lady, their intricate plans would
crumble before absolute strength.

Of course, they were confident if it were just Hela alone. Confidence
wavered when considering President Gandalf, an enigma, and the other
vice presidents, alongside the troublesome society members. Dealing with
them now seemed an insurmountable challenge.

Starlight surged, revealing a sorrowful woman in black nun's attire to
everyone on the ship. Her presence felt magnetic, as if attempting to
absorb everything around her.

It was akin to an unusually heavy iron ball falling from the center of a
taut fishing net, dragging objects down and pulling the surrounding net
with it. In these circumstances, previously still items naturally
slipped away.

The most impacted was Juan Oro, with a potent sea bloodline and
formidable sea power. Resisting the sea's fury, he felt a spatial
inversion, as if his front and back had switched to up and down. Like a
lost person above an abyss, he involuntarily "fell" to the bottom at an
accelerated speed, where the woman in black nun's attire awaited.

The deputy hosts, apart from Lumian, felt an unseen force tugging at
them. Struggling, they staggered towards the humanoid Sealed Artifact.
The sea's power within them wavered, propelling them to the surface,
revealing sparkling starry scales that hinted at losing control.

The Maidens of the Sea and the sailors on the ship struggled against the
terrifying suction force, swaying on the spot. Some experienced their
skin smoothing, others felt scales emerging in their flesh, and a few
shifted their feet intermittently.

Lumian, though relatively unscathed, exerted considerable strength to
resist the relentless pull.

As an Ascetic, he vaguely sensed the river of fate for everyone present
surging toward the humanoid Sealed Artifact. Future tributaries narrowed
and converged, leading inevitably to one possibility---death.

In that moment, Lumian grasped why the humanoid Sealed Artifact could
use words to curse someone to death.

Lato Guiaro reached out, gripping the shipboard to resist the invisible
pull from the woman.

His gaze scanned the people on the ship, then returned to the sea's
depths.

The ship descended, surrounded by a translucent wall of azure seawater.
Sea creatures swam within, seemingly oblivious to the anomaly. In the
distance, the spindle-shaped silver-gray object at the sea bottom, its
tip embedded in rocks, came into view.

Lato Guiaro suppressed any sign of a smile.

He was nearing his destination.

The fools from the Fisheries Guild and the oblivious Church of Earth
Mother might never comprehend what lay sealed at the bottom of the sea
here.

It wasn't a so-called "palace" but a spaceship!

A spacecraft that infiltrated during the Fourth Epoch!

It boasted a sci-fi dimension, housing advanced technology entwined with
mystical Beyonder elements, forming the core of the entire spaceship.

A locator, a petri dish, a breeding box, a key component of a
Stargate---a place where a Beyonder object slumbered.

The Ring of the Sea Queen, crafted by the sea spawn, served as the
spacecraft's key. Only when the external seal weakened annually could it
activate the spacecraft's internal power, merging the two to crack the
core seal!

Lato Guiaro's gaze grew greedier as he stared at the faintly discernible
silver-gray behemoth.

His aim extended beyond temporary authority---to become the true
Governor of the Sea and the spaceship's owner.

This would grant him immense power and the ability to accomplish
unimaginable feats using the spaceship.

The azure sea, tinged with a hint of green, encircled the ship as if
respectfully escorting them into the palace of the sea.

Seeing the sea's fury interrupted by the woman's sudden appearance,
making her the most perilous element, Juan Oro wasted no time deepening
his connection with the sea.

At that moment, he temporarily became the Governor of the Sea.

He resisted the terrifying suction force.

Abruptly, the humanoid Sealed Artifact "departed" from the ship,
entering an empty darkness.

Resplendent stars flickered above, below, and to her left. Ahead stood
Juan Oro, covered in starlight scales, deep-eyed, and with completely
white hair.

Juan Oro raised his right hand, swiping his finger.

The "stars" plummeted with fiery tails, stirring up waves.

On the betrothal ship, everyone lost the momentum to rush to the same
place. However, the power they used to resist the pull couldn't be
withdrawn, causing them to fall in the opposite direction.

Lato Guiaro feigned a similar state, crashing into the bow of the ship.

Seeing the silver-gray behemoth approaching, his heart leaped with joy.
He was about to recite a phrase he didn't comprehend but understood its
purpose.

It was a coded order to completely open the spaceship's door and
establish an energy passageway, allowing him to enter under protection!

April Fool's had been established for several years. Lato Guiaro's
decision to target the sea prayer ritual last year was influenced by the
resolution of other voices from the Governor of the Sea, Maidens of the
Sea, and certain sea spawn. This allowed them to understand the
significance of the three crucial passages.

"I espouse thee, O sea..." was one of the passages, its true meaning
being to inject energy into the created key and enter a password. Lato
Guiaro was about to recite the second paragraph, which served as an
order to initiate the spaceship.

Initially, he and Bard planned to deceive the foolish Nolfi, tricking
her into reciting the words to avoid danger. Once the spaceship
activated and left these waters, the sea prayer ritual would naturally
conclude. There wouldn't be any follow-up. Whether it involved
self-destruction or not, it wasn't a concern for her; she had achieved
her essential goal.

However, the situation changed drastically, especially when the
Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society learned about the sea prayer
ritual. Ultraman and Bard modified their plans, roping in external aid
and reducing Nolfi's role. Eventually, she became bait to lead
troublemakers, represented by Lumian Lee and Hidden Blade.

Lato Guiaro opened his mouth and muttered the words.

As he finished speaking, he looked expectantly at the spaceship at the
sea bottom.

But nothing happened!

*How is this possible?* Lato Guiaro's heart tightened, feeling a
sudden sense of danger.

With a jolt, he saw everything disintegrate like a soap bubble,
vanishing.

Lumian, transformed into Brian, had arrived near him at some point.

A dream!

He had been dreaming since Juan Oro pulled the humanoid Sealed Artifact
into the Cosmic Void!

*Hela!* This name flashed through Lato Guiaro's mind.

He had paid attention to whether there were other ships lurking around!

As these thoughts raced through his mind, formless hands appeared around
Lato Guiaro, pushing Lumian away.

Then, he saw a sailboat, clearly abandoned by time, outlined in the
cavity surrounded by seawater beside the betrothal ship. Shadows clung
to its canvas, and corpses stood on the observatory. The deck was
littered with decaying or boneless undead creatures.

At the bow of the ship, a woman dressed as a black widow stood silently.

Hela!

Less than four hours ago, Franca, posing as Charname, signaled Nolfi and
Batna to wait for further arrangements. Returning to the cabin, she
entered the captain's cabin and addressed Hela, standing by the window.

"I've roughly guessed who Ultraman is, but I can't be sure."

"I guessed as much," Hela replied, having overheard Franca and Nolfi's
conversation.

Franca gritted her teeth and said, "If it's really Lato Guiaro, there
will definitely be variables on the ship. I have to quickly summon
Lumian's messenger and inform him of our guess."

"Let's wait a little longer and time it well. We'll send the message
when the deputy hosts leave the Governor of the Sea's residence but
prior to boarding the ship," Hela advised.

Franca confirmed succinctly, "Got it."

She observed Hela, with her light-blond hair naturally cascading over
her shoulders, and her dark eyes seemingly darker as she meticulously
engraved patterns and arranged items on the captain's cabin desk. With
curiosity, she promptly inquired, "What's this for?"

"Setting up a ritual to completely conceal the entire ship, preventing
anyone from discovering it. It's impossible for me to do this on my own.
I can only achieve it through a deity's help. And She should be very
willing to help."

Without hesitation, Hela took off the pure silver ring embedded with a
black diamond from her right hand and placed it in the center of the
altar.

On the betrothal ship, Lumian scrutinized Lato Guiaro, his body
quivering with excitement.

He couldn't comprehend how the other party had thwarted the sea prayer
ritual once again. After all, he had been vigilantly observing this "old
friend" of his and hadn't witnessed any ring-switching.

Nonetheless, it didn't matter. A well-devised plan was not a fragile
creation that crumbled with the slightest mistake. It had to allow for
enough margin for error!

Similarly, Lato Guiaro couldn't fathom how Hela and the ship had
approached without triggering his detection.

But it didn't matter. If they hadn't prepared for the interference of
the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society and Hela, they wouldn't have
taken action this time.

Lato Guiaro's eyes suddenly darkened, and specks of starlight
illuminated.

The surrounding azure seawater froze once more.

Here, he surpassed the old-timer, Juan Oro. He had long amassed the
power to temporarily become the Governor of the Sea!

In the upcoming period, he would ascend to become the god of these
waters!
