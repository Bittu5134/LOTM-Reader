## Chapter 416: Suspect

*You're quite efficient. After receiving the warning, you swiftly
unearthed the problem and found the clues. Instead of confirming it
yourself, you're now informing me directly, intending to leverage this
issue for the final audit? No wonder you didn't respond when I inquired
about the audit completion date...* Franca's mind raced as she
grasped Browns Sauron's true intentions, representing the Demoness Sect.

Admiring the Demoness's appearance and demeanor, she smiled and asked,
"Is it just a suspicion?"

She was prompting the other party to provide more details.

Browns Sauron ran her fingers through her long orange-red hair and spoke
with a somber expression, "After learning from you that the Bliss
Society interacts with the participants in the orgies, I observed my
friends and noticed two members who were behaving unusually.

"One of them fell in love with a man once again and entered into a
romantic relationship. Consequently, she started declining participation
in the female orgies. The other one encountered a new woman and
succumbed to her advances, leading to feelings of guilt for betraying
us."

*Friends? Girlfriends!* Franca couldn't help but criticize.

She smiled and inquired, "Who do you suspect are the members of the
Bliss Society?"

"That woman," Browns Sauron's aura remained dark. "She took the
initiative to ask about the orgies and reassured Adaina that there was
no need to feel guilty. She claimed that everyone has the right to
control their bodies and freely indulge their desires without caring
about others' opinions, societal judgments, moral restrictions, or
religious constraints. She also stated that only deities and churches
that genuinely embrace free will, physical freedom, and desire freedom
are worth following."

*Physical freedom, desire freedom... It's indeed the hallmark of the
Mother Tree of Desire's believers... The key members of the Bliss
Society truly excel as Actors. Their acting skills are remarkable. They
can artfully package indulgence and debauchery, presenting desires as a
manifestation of willpower, subtly diminishing the importance of
rationality, clarity, and thoughtful reflection...* Franca
clicked her tongue and inwardly sighed.

For a Demoness of Pleasure, this approach proved highly effective. If
the surrounding humans believed it, she could swiftly immerse them in
intense and genuine pleasure, causing them to lose themselves in a sea
of indulgence. Long-term consequences and effects were typically
disregarded by most Demonesses, as they would have already digested the
potion by then.

However, Franca could discern that Browns Sauron was possessive and
didn't want her girlfriends to engage with humans outside of the orgies.

"That certainly resembles the Bliss Society," Franca objectively
remarked.

Browns added with a gloomy expression, "As for the other one, the lover
is primarily concerned with money, houses, banquets, vacations, and
various luxury items. It's quite evident that he's a male courtesan.
They understand women very well, are eloquent, and possess considerable
capabilities."

"What do you plan to do?" Franca asked curiously.

She sensed that Browns Sauron wasn't the type to simply give up on one
of her girlfriends, especially when the new lover seemed unreliable.

Browns Sauron hesitated for a few moments before saying, "I've
encountered him before, and I can tell he harbors an unusual desire for
me. I intend to teach him a lesson, immersing him in pleasure without
granting him true gratification. Once his body and mind are completely
under my control, I'll discard him."

*Wow... Did you learn this without a mentor? Do you even remember your
original form?* Franca raised an eyebrow, finding a rare target
for mockery.

Browns glanced at her mockingly and retorted, "Based on what I've
discovered and confirmed, you have two male lovers. One is mature, and
the other is young. You seem to excel at enjoying yourself."

Her implication was clear: "What right do you have to mock me? I'm
merely planning to offer that man some pleasure without engaging in
actual intimacy. As for you, you've long abandoned your gender, ending
up in the beds of different men!"

*Half of my reputation has been tarnished by Ciel!* Franca
didn't lose her composure over the humiliation. She maintained a smile
and said, "I view this as a unique experience.

"I've already become a woman. How can I not explore something entirely
different from my previous existence? If you don't experiment now, you
may never have the chance in the future. Don't you desire to return to
your original form. Do you not know how?"

She subtly hinted at her knowledge of mysticism, paving the way for
revealing her true motives for infiltrating the Savoie Mob in the
future.

Browns was left momentarily speechless, unable to refute Franca Roland's
twisted logic.

Franca continued, "Life is confined to just a few decades. Why confine
yourself to such a limited scope? As long as you avoid indulgence and
obsession and always remain true to yourself, you're merely experiencing
the present moment. Why not venture into various realms and
experiences?"

At this moment, Franca had an epiphany.

Pleasure wasn't just something to offer to others; it was also meant for
oneself!

*Is this my first principle of acting...? No wonder my digestion speed
hasn't been slowing down recently; it's even considered fast... How can
being coy be considered Pleasure?* Franca thought with a sense
of delight.

Browns fell silent for a few seconds before speaking, "Your mindset
surpasses my expectations, but with this mindset, it will be very, very
challenging for you to perform a ritual, advance to Affliction, or
experience pain and inflict it."

"I'm currently focused on Pleasure. I'll deal with Affliction when the
time comes," Franca replied casually.

The digestion process would take months, half a year, or even longer to
complete. What was the point of worrying too much?

Browns glanced at Franca for a moment, feeling a mix of repulsion and
envy.

It wasn't that she desired it, but the Demonesses she had encountered,
whether at higher Sequences or those who had just consumed the Witch
potion, lacked this calmness and radiance. Each of them carried their
own distortions, conflicts, and pain, and some even teetered on the edge
of madness.

Browns decided not to delve further into personal philosophy and steered
the conversation back on track.

"Adaina encountered the suspected Bliss Society member at an art
exhibition. She goes by the name Theresa and comes from a former noble
family. She's now an art dealer.

"I've conducted some investigation. Her identity and name are real, but
they don't belong to her. In other words, there is a real art dealer
named Theresa. She's impersonating her and has altered her appearance to
make herself more appealing.

"This aligns with the characteristics of an Actor, as you mentioned.
When Adaina had intimate contact with her, she also experienced the
abilities of a Sex Addict.

"I attempted to tail her earlier, but I was too cautious and lost her
trail.

"Adaina has a date with her tonight."

Franca listened attentively and then asked thoughtfully, "Can we trust
Adaina now?"

Browns's expression contorted as she replied, "She can be trusted."

Franca didn't press further and reminded her deliberately, "Then, will
she exhibit any unusual behavior during her date with Theresa tonight?
She's dealing with an Actor."

"Perhaps. She needs a Psychiatrist or an even more powerful Beyonder of
the Spectator pathway to plant a cue or hypnotize her. This will help
her maintain her normal state and prevent Theresa from becoming
suspicious.

"If you can't find one in a hurry, I can introduce someone, but it will
come at a cost."

Browns's expression softened as she nodded in agreement.

"You're indeed more experienced than I am."

Following her sigh, she smiled and asked, "Is that Psychiatrist also a
man?"

Franca was taken aback.

"Yes."

*Hey, what kind of image do you have of me!*

The two of them silently refrained from discussing which side would
handle the subsequent questions after identifying the fake Theresa. It
was as if they had already reached an unspoken agreement.

At 7 p.m., in Quartier de la Maison d'Opéra, just outside the Delan
Music Hall, Franca and Lumian, both dressed in light-colored pants,
walked toward the entrance while discreetly holding each other's arms.

They had used Lie to alter their appearances and heights, ensuring that
they wouldn't be recognized by anyone they might know.

Their target for this operation was the woman entering the concert hall,
about seven to eight meters away.

Among them, Adaina, a participant in the Red House female orgies, had
long, light-yellow hair with thin, curly bangs. Her face was powdered,
her eyes light blue, and her nose perky, making her quite attractive. As
for the art dealer, Theresa, she had long, wavy brown hair and a simple
style. When her flaxen-colored eyes scanned the surroundings, they
sparkled with liveliness.

This woman, suspected to be a member of the Bliss Society, had somewhat
stiff facial features. It lacked softness but still exuded a strange
charm.

Inside the small concert hall, Lumian and Franca found their seats and
then swiftly locked onto Theresa and Adaina's location, discreetly
observing them from behind.

Franca watched with interest as Adaina and Theresa leaned against each
other, feigning intimacy.

It was a pity that, despite her claim of loving women, Franca's limited
experience mainly revolved around "teasing" Gardner Martin's other
lovers. She had seldom been able to admire such scenes from a distance.

"Be careful," Lumian warned with a sigh.

Franca responded disapprovingly, "For a Trierien, this attitude is
entirely normal. Look around you. Aren't others openly watching as
well?"

Lumian snorted and didn't push the matter further.

Their immediate objective was observation, not tailing. It was crucial
to assess the target's situation before taking any action.

Turning an ambush and surprise attack into an open confrontation would
be a failure for any Hunter.

Lumian's primary goal was to gather information about Theresa's probable
Sequence. If she happened to be a Sequence 7 Actor or a Sequence 6
Recipient, Lumian was confident in executing a successful surprise
attack. However, if she turned out to be a Fallen Tree Spirit of a
specific tree with a changed lifeform, the effectiveness of the Spell of
Harrumph might be questionable.

Although Franca had suggested using Magic Mirror Divination to gather
this intel, Lumian still wanted to witness it firsthand. The desires of
a corresponding Sequence of the Mother Tree of Desire pathway couldn't
be easily concealed!
