## Chapter 336: Armored Shadow's Origins

Lumian shifted his focus away from thoughts of Roche Louise Sanson, the
Soul Summoning Spell, and April Fool's. He began recounting the tale
from the very beginning, all at the behest of Franca.

"In the wake of the Cordu disaster, I found myself tainted by the
corruption of the evil god, Inevitability. Fortunately, the protection
granted to me by Mr. Fool allowed me to retain my sanity, preventing me
from transforming into a monster.

"This corruption, a curse and yet a blessing, is now being extracted in
stages, as per the instructions of Madam Magician. The aim is to channel
this corruption into my own power, finding equilibrium with the
corresponding Sequence Beyonder characteristic."

Franca was enlightened.

"So, what you were referring to as a 'special contract' is essentially
the power of a Contractee? No wonder you mentioned it's impossible for
me to learn it."

Since Lumian didn't know the powers of a Sequence 6 of the Inevitability
pathway, she deduced his current state as a dual Sequence 7 Pyromaniac
and Contractee.

Lumian nodded.

"That's why Guillaume Bénet doesn't dare to meddle with my fate
recklessly. The degree of corruption within me is rather substantial."

A sudden revelation crossed Franca's mind. "To require Mr. Fool's
safeguard, it means there must be godhood involved. Could there be a
chance for me to receive similar boons?"

Do you want to give everything a shot? Lumian clicked his tongue and
asked, "Are you prepared to seek out the Great Mother, engaging in daily
cycles of pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding? Alternatively, do
you wish to put faith in the Mother Tree of Desire and drag stray dogs
to bed?"

"Hiss..." Franca gasped and said, "I was merely musing. Engaging in the
risky business of following an evil god is out of the question for me.
The immediacy of gaining Mr. Fool's protection by merely brushing
against the power of an evil god, much like you, is a rarity indeed."

"This isn't a mere brush against power." To dispel Franca's unrealistic
thoughts, Lumian divulged a little more. "The power of Inevitability is
sealed within me. In essence, I beseech Mr. Fool and the corruption
within me, for a boon instead of the entity known as Inevitability. This
approach is pivotal for ensuring my very survival. Otherwise, I risk
becoming unrecognizable or just dying abruptly."

Franca instinctively exhaled and said, "Just tell me about the Spell of
Harrumph."

Lumian restructured his narrative, stating, "To prevent any indirect
influences from Inevitability, I gave up the strange creatures that
accompanied the knowledge bestowed by the boon. Instead, I obtained a
wealth of information about creatures from the spirit world through
Madam Magician. You know the rest.

"The Spell of Harrumph originates from a creature of the spirit world
that I summoned. Initially, I aimed to summon the Shadow of Shriek.
However, whether due to my invocation being witnessed by Mr. Fool or my
summoning incantation lacking precision, I can't say for certain, but
the entity I summoned greatly diverged from the description of the
Shadow of Shriek..."

Lumian delineated the relevant summoning incantation, the concept
driving its formulation, the Armored Shadow's visual attributes, and its
array of capabilities, all in meticulous detail. He even used his
barely-passable drawing skills to illustrate a rudimentary schematic.

*Fish Scale Armor... Spell of Harrumph... Night Parade of Ten Thousand
Demons... Soul Devouring Scream...* Franca softly uttered these
names to herself while gazing at the sketch on the coffee table, her
gaze seemingly distant.

Lumian probed, "Is there an issue?"

Were Aurore present, would she also react in a similar fashion?

Franca snapped back to the present, her expression a blend of solemnity
and exhilaration.

"That Armored Shadow might very well be from our world!"

"The world that you guys come from?" Lumian hadn't expected such an
answer.

Yet, it made sense. The armor's design and the ability names bore a
distinctive uniqueness, setting them apart from the present world.

Franca confirmed tersely.

"There are many countries in our world, and the culture and language of
each country are different. The Armored Shadow is very similar to some
entity in the myths and legends of the country your sister and I hail
from."

"Are you from the same country as Aurore?" Lumian was most concerned
about this.

He paused a beat before continuing, "Did Mr. Fool's might, combined with
my imprecise incantation, summon the Armored Shadow from your world? Or
did he transmigrate long ago, much like you, eventually transforming
into a spirit world shadow after his demise?"

Franca said excitedly, "If it's the former, it could signify a bridge
between our two worlds. This implies the potential for our return! If
it's the latter, the question arises: how did he use the capabilities of
our original world? Did he bring these skills along, or did he acquire
them at a later time?"

Resolving these mysteries would inch her closer to the truth of
transmigration, potentially paving the path back home!

Franca rose from her seat, her eyes gleaming with intrigue as she faced
Lumian.

"Can you summon the Armored Shadow? I'm keen to witness it firsthand."

"I have a pact with him. The need to invoke Mr. Fool's intervention is
eliminated for precise summoning," Lumian observed Franca's evident
enthusiasm, as though she was readying to assist in setting up the
altar. Steering the conversation, he added, "Nonetheless, I perceive him
to be immensely dangerous. While under Mr. Fool's aegis, the danger is
mitigated. However, if that protection wanes, we could well find
ourselves killed by the shadow. Yet, should we remain sheltered by Mr.
Fool, direct communication remains an impossibility, precluding spirit
channeling. We can solely execute the summoning rite."

Franca frowned in disappointment.

"What's our course of action then?"

Lumian pondered for a moment and said, "Wait till I gather 100,000 verl
d'or worth of gold and fulfill the contract.

"By doing so, the pact's power shall act as our shield, enabling us to
figure out why the Armored Shadow demands such a substantial sum."

After a thoughtful pause that spanned nearly a minute, Franca finally
exhaled.

"That's all we can do for now."

Initially, her intention had been to promptly corroborate the situation
concerning the Armored Shadow and extract pertinent insights from it.
Subsequently, she planned to inform the Curly-Haired Baboons Research
Society, pooling their collective effort to unearth viable solutions.
However, for the time being, she had no choice but to defer these
actions.

After a period of immersion in the summoning incantation, it became
evident that Franca's success rate in summoning was rather low,
presumably due to an imprecise methodology. While it was possible that a
Shadow of Shriek could be summoned, Lumian surmised that by omitting a
particular descriptive line and using "Lumian Lee's contracted
creature," the target could be pinpointed more precisely.

After a while, Jenna returned with a spread of coffee, treats, and
meatloaf. The ravenous appetites that had ensued from their prior battle
now found their solace in afternoon tea.

As evening approached, Anthony Reid, masquerading as a clerk, made his
return to Apartment 601 at 3 Rue des Blouses Blanches.

"How did it go?" Lumian's concern was evident, unabashedly displayed.

With his weathered top hat set aside, Anthony nodded slightly.

"I trailed the lady, her butler, valet, maid, and carriage driver to 20
Rue de la Terrasse, within the library district.

"It appears to be an alternate residence of sorts, akin to a safe
house."

Franca turned her gaze towards Lumian, inquiring, "Should we maintain
surveillance?"

Lumian ruminated for a beat and then grinned.

"No need. Periodic checks to ensure they haven't left will suffice."

"Why?" Jenna had expected Ciel to rush to deal with them to gather more
information.

Lumian's smile was radiant.

"Behind them stands an organization known as the Sinners. Their point of
contact is likely aware of Guillaume Bénet's demise, prompting them to
disengage and erase any traces, making investigation thorny.

"Yet, if the Sinners find that they had managed to evade our pursuit and
that there's no surveillance, what might come to pass?

"Perhaps a connection will be reestablished!

"Only authentic non-surveillance can convince the Sinners that the issue
has faded. They could then become active anew, crawling out from their
rat's nest!"

*Dammit...* Jenna cursed silently.

*Ciel is so sinister!*

Anthony, having garnered significant intel, claimed two-thirds of the
final 15,000 verl d'or, leaving Jenna with a share of 5,000.

As banknotes were deftly stowed away within assorted pockets, Anthony
Reid turned his attention to Lumian.

"I'm eager to delve into the secrets surrounding Hugues Artois and the
truth behind his treachery. I hope to begin the investigation soon."

This was the primary reason for his involvement in the operation.

"Very well." Lumian had already discussed this matter with Jenna and
Franca.

Jenna was set to glean relevant details from the Purifiers.

As Franca was highly excited about the Armored Shadow matter, she took
the initiative to suggest,

"I have acquaintances from Loen. I'll see if I can obtain a battle
record from the Loen military. It might shed new light on the
situation."

"That's a good idea." Anthony Reid's eyes lit up.

The notion of soliciting the truth directly from the attacker had not
previously crossed his mind.

___

On Rue Anarchie's forever-bustling nights, Lumian, relinquishing the
task of divining the incantations to Franca, walked towards Auberge du
Coq Doré. There, his intent was to summon the messenger of Madam
Magician, intending to relay matters regarding Guillaume Bénet, the
Sinners organization, and the Armored Shadow. Concurrently, he hoped she
could relay to Madam Justice and Madam Susie his readiness for their
final therapy session.

Under the cool embrace of the night breeze, Lumian's thoughts unfurled
languidly.

After learning from Franca about the shared trait among members of the
Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society, Lumian's impression of Aurore
crystallized.

Of course, the vagueness was something he didn't understand at first,
but he deemed it of little consequence. Investigations were unwarranted.

*It's no wonder that Aurore severed her familial ties to reside in
Cordu, a frontier village. It's no wonder that she harbors a
disinclination towards Trier. It's no wonder she always says strange
words and likes to explain to me what they mean. It's no wonder her
novels were different from the contemporary ones. It's no wonder she
likes to say 'a certain philosopher from home once said' only to
substitute it with 'Emperor Roselle once said'...* Lumian
ruminated in a wordless, contemplative cadence, a sensation of calm
washing over him, as if he wasn't strolling on Rue Anarchie but Cordu.

It was a place he could never return to.

Simultaneously, Lumian gained an understanding of the symbolic elements
in the dream.

*Aurore's acquisition of the land previously occupied by a deceased
Warlock---could this embody her possession of Roche Louise Sanson's
body?*

*Consequently, might the legendary Warlock, Roche Louise Sanson,
symbolize the original adherents of Inevitability?*

Mr. Poet failed to interpret the dual symbolic meanings because he
lacked crucial information previously. He had solely indicated to Lumian
that they likely bore their own significance.

As his thoughts raced, Lumian returned to Room 207 and saw a simple
folded letter on the table.

*Letter? This doesn't seem like Madam Magician's...* Lumian
walked over, alarmed and suspicious. He picked up the letter and
unfolded it.

Two lines of elegant Intisian script graced the parchment:

"I have arrived in Trier.

"Hela."
