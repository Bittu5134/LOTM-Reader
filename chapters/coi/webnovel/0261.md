## Chapter 261: Escape

The branches and vines pursuing Lumian swiftly withdrew, as if
responding to an unseen command. A javelin-like tree trunk crashed down,
causing the rest to vanish into thin air.

Gasping for breath, Lumian cast his gaze upward as he sprinted onward.

At that moment, his eyes fell upon the incinerated form of Susanna
Mattise, consumed by the vegetative sphere that had enveloped her. Not
far off, he witnessed an unfamiliar tree trunk snap and succumb to fiery
destruction.

She's dead! Relief flooded Lumian's being. She's dead! The burden of his
struggle lifted, and he crumpled to the ground, no longer able to hold
on.

The crimson flames that had enveloped him abruptly extinguished,
unveiling his charred and disfigured body.

With great effort, Lumian struggled to prop himself up, his back pressed
against the vine- and branch-adorned wall of the Auberge du Coq Doré. He
resembled a forsaken vagabond, abandoned by the world, a hint of
derision in his voice as he observed the Tree of Shadow sinking deeper
and deeper into the earth.

Moreover, he witnessed the vines and branches retracting into the main
trunk, the once-suspended individuals released from their tethers and
descending to the ground from varying heights.

Among the initial group of victims, whose essence had been drained,
three to four individuals remained suspended nearly three meters above
the ground. Already weakened, most of their remaining vitality escaped
as they suffered the harsh impact, causing them to lose consciousness on
the spot. Perhaps there was still hope for their salvation, or perhaps
they were beyond rescue.

The hundreds who had been suspended but had not yet lost a significant
portion of their essence sustained various injuries from the fall.
Though their lives were not immediately endangered, they hurriedly rose
to their feet, driven to escape to the fringes of the wilderness.

Gabriel's complexion turned pale, bruises marring his hands and feet.
Rather than fleeing, his initial instinct led him to stoop and collect
the scattered Lightseeker script from the ground. The eloping couple,
entwined together in their suspension, exchanged curses for being a
hindrance, but they supported one another as they limped forward, their
legs injured from the fall. They joined the fleeing throng, vanishing
into the distance. Pavard Neeson, the proprietor of the clandestine
underground bar, suffered relatively minor injuries. Grasping the
freshly drawn draft, he raced ahead...

Charred and weary, Lumian settled on the street, leaning against the
Auberge du Coq Doré, situated perilously close to the Tree of Shadow.
Tilting his head back against the wall, he wore a faint smile while
observing the energetic exodus of peddlers, passersby, and inhabitants
of modest abodes as they fled towards the outskirts of the wilderness.

Within the confines of the Tree of Shadow, Lady Moon beheld a tumultuous
clash unfolding, with numerous angels and saints joining the fray. Her
faction faced mounting pressure due to reinforcements from the two
Churches and Bureau 8. An overwhelming sense of retreat washed over her.

Should this continue, the two Churches might resort to drastic measures,
beseeching divine intervention! Lady Moon swiftly resolved.

Deprived of several abilities and ensnared by various Prohibitions, she
pressed against the bulge in her abdomen and parted her lips.

An ear-piercing Shriek erupted within this alternate realm, causing the
nearly two-meter-tall Tree of Shadow before her to undergo an
instantaneous metamorphosis.

Upon the branches and mist-shrouded bark, which depicted scenes from the
past, figures born from diverse desires, now lifeless, sprang back to
existence, save for Emperor Roselle.

Many were demigods, emerging from their respective "histories" with
vacant, icy expressions and an aura of chilling darkness.

Resurrection!

Empowered by the Divine Fetus nestled within her womb and the unique
essence of the Tree of Shadow, Lady Moon temporarily revived the
accumulated desires from over a millennium in their original corporeal
forms.

Though the revival would be short-lived, and the resurrected beings
notably weaker than before, the sudden influx of demigods into the
battle within mere seconds could profoundly impact the unfolding chaos.

It was precisely due to the timely aid of the Divine Fetus that Lady
Moon dared to linger behind, partaking in this tumultuous clash. Without
it, having only agreed to provide cover and hindrance to those from the
Bliss Society, she would have already sought refuge elsewhere.

In eerie silence, the resurrected phantoms disintegrated beneath the
scorching sunlight. Lady Moon seized the opportune moment to summon
Paramita, which had not yet fallen into complete disarray, merging with
it and vanishing from sight.

On Avenue du Marché, inside the khaki-colored four-story building that
housed the parliament member's office.

Imre, the mixed-blood individual, refrained from immediately questioning
Jenna, an assassin. Instead, he directed two agents from Bureau 7 to
tend to Jenna's wound, staunching the profuse bleeding and applying
bandages. He conveyed the impression that allowing the culprit to
succumb to her injuries would hinder their ability to gather crucial
clues. Valentine, Antoine, and the other agents observed and
interrogated the remaining participants of the banquet, including
Cassandra and Rhône, who belonged to Hugues Artois's team.

*Rumble!*

Once again, the ground beneath their feet trembled. Those near the
windows caught glimpses of Rue Anarchie, Rue du Rossignol, and Rue des
Blouses Blanches, intermittently flickering with light. Approaching them
were clergymen garbed in white robes embellished with golden threads,
wielding various contraptions.

This development disrupted the interrogation of Imre, Valentine, and the
others. After a while, Angoulême de François strode into the banquet
hall, clad in a coat adorned with golden buttons, accompanied by a
grayish-white humanoid mechanical creation. Several additional team
members and a contingent of police officers followed suit.

Upon hearing Imre's report, Angoulême cast a glance at Jenna and
instructed Travis Everett, "Bring all the attendees of the banquet to
headquarters for separate interrogations.

"Leave the assassin here. We shall handle her questioning. Hmm... also
keep the members of Monsieur Member of Parliament's team. There are
matters we must clarify."

Everett raised no objections. The organization's constables escorted the
anxious onlookers away from the khaki-colored building housing the
member of parliament's office.

As the hall emptied, Angoulême turned to the two Bureau 7 agents
standing beside Jenna and instructed them, "Escort the assassin to the
lounge. We must ensure she does not overhear our conversation and
withhold any truths."

With Jenna escorted to the lounge facing the back alley, Angoulême
approached Cassandra, Rhône, and the others, speaking in a deep voice,
"Hi there, there is information we must acquire."

A faint smile adorned his face.

"Indeed, Monsieur Member of Parliament has met his demise. According to
the law, his position is immediately vacated.

"In other words, you are no longer part of Monsieur Member of
Parliament's team. The immunity you once enjoyed is no more.

"So, before we engage in our discussion, let us proceed with some
notarizations."

Upon hearing Angoulême's words, Cassandra and the others' expressions
underwent a marked change.

Meanwhile, in the lounge, Jenna, who had calmed herself after
assassinating Hugues Artois, heard a tumultuous commotion emanating from
the hall.

One of the armed agents from Bureau 7, tasked with keeping watch,
hastened to the door to investigate.

Seizing the opportunity, Jenna's heart skipped a beat as a plan
materialized in her mind.

Her countenance transformed, and she gazed past her remaining guard with
a mix of surprise and fear.

Though extensively trained, the agent possessed an understanding beyond
that of ordinary individuals. Today, an abnormal occurrence had unfolded
on Rue Anarchie, culminating in the assassination of Monsieur Member of
Parliament. Reports indicated a battle involving supernatural forces
transpiring within the hall. It was only natural for him to worry about
potential repercussions reaching the lounge and an unseen threat lurking
behind him.

Subconsciously, he entertained the notion of turning around, but halfway
through the motion, caution compelled him to remain vigilant.

Yet, this proved to be the only opening Jenna needed.

Already restrained by handcuffs, she balled her fists and struck the
agent's shoulder and neck with force, sending him sprawling to the
ground. His revolver slipped from his grasp.

Before the agent near the door could react, Jenna positioned her hands
on the windowsill, propelling herself upward. She crashed through the
glass and descended into the back alley with the grace of a feather.

Suppressing the pain from her gunshot wound, she sought refuge in the
shadows of a nearby corner and swiftly departed the khaki-colored
building.

Lady Moon weaved through different directions, employing various
abilities until she finally emerged from Paramita.

At that moment, she found herself in Quartier Éraste, northwest of
Trier. Before her stood a magnificent building adorned with golden
steeples.

Lady Moon cautiously surveyed her surroundings and discreetly let out a
sigh of relief.

Had the Tree of Shadow's deeper intrusion into the Fourth Epoch's Trier
served the Great Mother's interests, she wouldn't have joined the Bliss
Society's mission. She had no desire to reveal herself. It was
well-known that those who controlled desires often fell prey to their
own desires. The chances of failure were not insignificant.

Without delay, Lady Moon slipped into the beige building from its side
entrance.

A few hundred meters away, a golden retriever sat silently beside a
woman dressed in green.

They observed Lady Moon's every move and the grand structure with its
numerous steeples, their expressions solemn.

It was the Sacred Heart Cloister of the Eternal Blazing Sun Church.

In the wilderness where Rue Anarchie, Rue du Rossignol, and the
buildings on Rue des Blouses Blanches crumbled, Lumian witnessed the
Tree of Shadow on the brink of sinking into the ground. He couldn't help
but taunt Termiboros.

"Well, I'm not that unlucky after all. I've actually succeeded."

Hardly had the words left his lips when Franca, who had regained her
senses, rushed over and hissed, "Are you trying to play the role of a
charred corpse?"

As she spoke, she retrieved the Healing Agent she had obtained from the
Poison Spur Mob, intending to offer Lumian half a canister.

Lumian's injuries weren't as severe as they seemed. Fatal burns for most
Low-Sequence Beyonders would require no more than a month or two for
Pyromaniacs to recover from. As for fractures, explosions, and impacts,
none of them could claim the life of a Hunter immediately. Enduring
until tomorrow would naturally bring about recovery.

Considering the potential pursuit of official Beyonders after the
wilderness completely vanished, Lumian didn't tempt fate and consumed
half a vial.

Soon, he felt his body rapidly regenerating.

At this moment, the wilderness teetered on the edge of collapse. The
streets had returned to their original positions, and many people had
already rushed in.

Franca surveyed her surroundings and spoke swiftly, "Can you still move?
We must leave this place swiftly."

"Alright." Lumian rose to his feet.

He took a couple of steps to the side, intending to retrieve the charred
tree trunk that had been part of the Tree of Shadow before departing.

Just as Lumian grasped the trunk, something caught his peripheral
vision.

Within the depression left behind by the Tree of Shadow's submersion, a
hazy and translucent creature darted past.

Lumian's pupils dilated, struggling to believe what he had witnessed. He
yearned for a clearer view.

It was a diaphanous, indistinct figure resembling a lizard!

It bore an uncanny resemblance to the elf he had encountered in his
dream!

It was the very creature that had emerged from Aurore's mouth!
