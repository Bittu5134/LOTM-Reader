## Chapter 1064: Headquarters

After Professor communicated with their eyes with her husband, Periodic
Table and others for a while, she finally nodded and said, "Hidden
Blade, we're willing to join."

Making this decision and speaking these words made her suddenly relax,
no longer so tense.

At this current crossroads, whether for good or ill, whichever path they
chose, they had to move forward. They couldn't stop or retreat anymore.

If they didn't seize this opportunity to completely eliminate the Hidden
Sage, they would either be forced to stay in Trier to face the possible
coming apocalypse, or lose control and go mad in another big city,
becoming monsters and even endangering their families.

Franca breathed a sigh of relief, stating, "Would you like to sign a
notarized document to ensure I fulfill all my promises?

"Don't worry, this notarized document was created by another Saint and
is watched over by a true god---it has strong binding power over me as
well."

Professor shook her head and said with a smile, "No need. We trust you
and Madame Hela."

She paused, then hesitantly asked, "How long will this operation last?
We have children at home who need care. Though we have servants, we're
not entirely at ease."

Franca had already prepared for this.

"For those of you who are married couples with children, only one person
needs to go. Those who are single parents or have other relatives
needing special care can opt out of this operation. However, those who
stay behind need to bring their children or other dependents to live
together in one place, under Madame Hela's watch and protection."

This was to prevent secrets from leaking---the relevant personnel had to
be placed under secrecy or sworn to secrecy.

*Phew...* Professor noticeably relaxed and turned to Associate
Professor, saying, "I'll go."

"I'll go!" Associate Professor rejected her proposal without hesitation.

The two argued until Professor made the final decision.

"My Sequence is higher than yours and my condition is better. It'll be
safer if I go!"

"Fine..." Associate Professor regretted for the first time spending too
much time on unrelated research.

After some discussion, those participating in this operation would be
Professor, Periodic Table, and another male Warlock called "Prototype."

"Let's go." Franca tossed out a mirror.

Under the influence of phantasms, the mirror grew larger and larger,
fixing itself as a crystalline entrance.

Franca led the three Warlocks of different sequences across the solid
mirror surface into the dark void of the mirror realm.

They plummeted through an illusory dark tunnel, with light and shadows
rapidly shifting around them, as if other mirrors were projecting their
reflected images into it.

Thus, after an unknown period---perhaps very short, perhaps very
long---Professor and the others finally saw the exit.

Led by Hidden Blade Franca, they whooshed out of the mirror, stepping
onto a wooden floor that creaked under their feet.

Periodic Table instinctively looked around and found they were aboard an
ancient three-masted sailing ship. The gray-white mainsails billowed in
the fierce wind, and only one or two sailors were on deck, making it
feel quite eerie and quiet.

Outside the ship, dark blue waves rose and fell, with thin fog
permeating the entire sea area.

When Professor, Periodic Table, and Prototype all looked at her, Franca
raised her right hand, pointing in one direction, and said with a smile,
"Our destination---west!"

*Splash!* A low wave crashed over.

___

An ice-blue wave crashed against Future's bow, producing numerous white
sprays.

The Hermit, wearing a purple-patterned robe and thick glasses, stood at
the bow, glanced at the changing weather above and the brewing
snowstorm, then raised her right hand, signaling the ship to slow down
and circle this small area of sea.

The sailors performed their duties, some adjusting the sail direction,
others lowering one of the sails, until Future's condition finally
satisfied the captain, Queen of Stars Cattleya's requirements.

Cattleya removed the thick glasses from her nose bridge, revealing a
pair of deep purple, almost black eyes.

She immediately began speaking numbers with a mysterious aura, "1, 5, 4,
3, 7, 8..."

These numbers materialized one after another, becoming entangled in
mid-air, numbering several hundred.

They were the entry password to the Moses Ascetic Order headquarters!

The Moses Ascetic Order headquarters was created by one of the Ten
Pillars, the respected Chairman Torriope, using Mystical Re-enactment,
and named "Avalon."

Avalon existed neither in reality nor in the spirit realm, but was
completely hidden somewhere in the North Sea. Only those invited or
qualified could enter, and they must also grasp a corresponding string
of numbers numbering 365 digits.

For the Moses Ascetic Order, everything was numbers. Each number had
spirituality, symbolism, and special meaning. When combined, these
numbers naturally possessed mystical power.

As The Hermit Cattleya spoke the correct spiritual numbers, which
materialized and became entangled in mid-air, the numbers suddenly
vanished, as if sinking into somewhere.

Within seconds, it was as if an invisible curtain was drawn aside in
front of Future, and a small boat sailed out unhurriedly, unmanned.

Starlight quickly lit up, extending from Future's bow to fall upon that
small boat. The Hermit Cattleya stepped across the brilliant bridge
formed by starlight and boarded the small boat in just a few steps.

As one of the Ten Pillars of the Moses Ascetic Order, she naturally had
the qualifications to enter Avalon, and currently barely qualified as
part of the core team.

The small boat carrying Cattleya turned around and headed back in the
direction it came from.

The Queen of Stars's silhouette gradually faded until it disappeared
from the view of Future's crew.

After passing through layers of transparent curtains, The Hermit
Cattleya saw an island.

The island was shrouded in mist, lined with trees bearing golden apples,
with music faintly drifting from the distance---peaceful, tranquil, and
abundant.

The small boat stopped at the dock, and the Hermit walked toward the
depths of the apple grove, where there stood a warlock's spire as if
stepped out of a story.

Along the way, she encountered over a dozen humans dressed as warlocks.

These people stopped in succession, greeting the Ten Pillars with nods.

They were all members of the Moses Ascetic Order, raised in Avalon since
childhood, receiving corresponding teachings, most trusted. Currently,
they were all in their period of silence to increase focus, enhance
spirituality, and deeply master various morals and precepts.

Only Warlocks who grew up this way could eventually compete for the
positions of Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Moses Ascetic Order.
"Outsiders" like the Queen of Stars, who joined later, could at most
become one of the "Pillars," and would need to undergo years of testing
and observation before having any hope of entering the core team.

The Hermit likewise responded to these silent Warlocks with nods, and
soon passed through the trees laden with golden apples to reach the tall
black spire.

Inside the spire, the wall protrusions, floor tiles, statues on both
sides, and the elevator pulled by invisible servants were all composed
of numbers. They looked normal at first glance, but upon closer
inspection, one would find that even a small bump was formed by multiple
intertwined numbers.

Hundreds of millions, billions of numbers were densely distributed
throughout the spire, settling into different objects. Walking among
them, The Hermit felt surrounded by countless numbers.

In her eyes, there were no walls, no bricks, no statues, no
elevators---only numbers!

At this time, some Warlocks who had finished their period of silence
were moving about in the spire. They either conversed quietly, went
about their business, or huddled in corners, letting the strange eyes
within the cracks on their faces observe their surroundings.

These latter ones were members approaching loss of control. After the
Hidden Sage's knowledge infusions became increasingly crazy and
frequent, even the Moses Ascetic Order, which had mastered safe
"listening" methods, inevitably had Warlocks moving toward loss of
control, far more than in previous years.

What was once safe was no longer safe.

If not for this problem, with the Moses Ascetic Order's accumulation
plus the initial spiritual decline as the apocalypse approached, they
certainly had more than ten demigods. But unfortunately, they still only
had ten Pillars.

The Hermit's gaze withdrew from these Warlocks' faces as she entered the
elevator. Pulled by invisible servants, she went all the way up to the
spire's top floor.

Here, the Chairman and one of the two Vice Chairmen were always on duty.
Among them, Chairman Torriope and Vice Chairman Retia Austin were
Pillars that the Hermit couldn't quite get a read on.

Before arriving today, The Hermit Cattleya had already confirmed that
Chairman Torriope---an Angel on the Mystery Pryer pathway---was on duty
in Avalon.

As soon as the elevator steadied, Cattleya walked forward.

This was a hall larger than the spire's top floor itself. On the black
walls, floor, and ceiling were eyes, each different, strangely shaped,
and all cold eyes.

They all seemed to be watching the Queen of Stars.

At the end of the room, against the windowless wall, stood three dark
gold statues---one wearing a mask, one resembling a lion, and one like
an eagle.

Chairman Torriope seemed not to be present.

Just then, the masked dark gold statue's mouth moved, issuing a grand
but hollow voice, "I have foreseen your betrayal!"

Hearing these words, Queen of Stars Cattleya wasn't surprised, only
somewhat sighing.

Indeed, it was impossible to truly hide from a high-sequence
Clairvoyant.

Once there was action, They would prophesy certain scenes or fragments.
One could only try to delay when such perceptions appeared, or make the
corresponding prophecies difficult to interpret!

A card suddenly appeared in Cattleya's hand. On its face was depicted a
lonely old man with a cane, carrying a glass lamp.

The Hermit card!
