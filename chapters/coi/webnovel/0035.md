## Chapter 35: Differences

*It's about as strong as the 'last time'... *Lumian muttered to
himself as he looked at the corpse of the skinless monster.

Before the time reversal, he had been evenly matched with the monster,
relying on his intelligence to defeat it. Now, as a Beyonder, he only
needed one swing of his axe to finish it off.

Of course, he had the advantage of already experiencing the same
sequence of events and knowing the monster's attack strategy. This
allowed him to anticipate its moves.

The contrast between before and after made Lumian feel that he had
undergone a significant improvement after becoming a Beyonder.

After pondering for a moment, he moved the monster's corpse and head to
a corner but did not hide it under rocks, wood, and mud, leaving it
exposed along with the blood on the ground.

Lumian then quickly searched the half-collapsed building and found the
remaining 197 verl d'or and 25 coppet, categorizing them into different
pockets.

He flipped through the *livre bleu* again but found nothing out
of the ordinary.

Once he had completed his search, he snuck deeper into the ruins.
However, after only 20 to 30 meters, he changed course and returned to
his starting point. Following the path the skinless monster had taken
while alive, he nimbly climbed onto the half-collapsed roof.

After making the necessary preparations, he hid himself.

Minute by minute, Lumian waited patiently like an experienced hunter.

After an unknown period of time, a figure emerged from the ruins.

It was the same monster that had previously given Lumian a Hunter
Beyonder characteristic, with its half-human, half-beast appearance,
bent knees, greasy black hair, and shotgun on its back.

The shotgun monster approached cautiously, as if on a daily patrol.

Suddenly it sniffed the air and detected the blood in the distance.

It quickly changed direction and headed towards the half-collapsed,
burnt building.

Following the trail of blood, the monster found the skinless monster's
corpse and head.

It squatted down to examine it carefully.

On the half-collapsed roof, Lumian shook his head and muttered to
himself, *You can't even smell me from such a distance? Even with the
smell of blood, you shouldn't have missed me!*

As he muttered, he raised his axe and struck hard at the crevice in the
stone beside him that he had prepared earlier.

*Crash!*

The half-collapsed roof shook, and heavy rocks crashed down.

The shotgun monster reacted quickly, twisting its waist, kicking its
feet, and lunging towards an uncollapsed area.

Lumian smiled and swooped down from the intact roof like an eagle
grabbing its prey in midair.

In the midst of the howling wind, Lumian and the shotgun monster clashed
in the air. Lumian raised his axe with one hand while the monster
desperately tried to turn around and block.

Lumian clenched his left hand into a fist and punched down. As the
monster extended its arm to block, Lumian opened his palm and reduced
his strength, grabbing the monster's arm.

As Lumian pulled back with his left hand, he suddenly cleaved down with
his axe in his right hand.

The blade struck the monster, and they both fell to the ground in a pool
of blood.

Lumian, who had a buffer pad, was not affected by the impact. He raised
his hand and cleaved the monster's head from its body with his axe once
again.

Despite its unwillingness, the head rolled twice and separated from the
body.

Standing up, Lumian looked at the monster and sneered, "You've weakened!

"All you have is a terrifying shell, nothing more than a stuffed
scarecrow inside!"

As a Hunter, he was confident in dealing with the shotgun monster again,
but he hadn't expected it to be so easy.

Looking at the corpse on the ground, Lumian patiently waited for the
Beyonder characteristic to appear.

However, after waiting for a long time, he saw no sign of the dark-red
light.

"Nothing?" Lumian muttered to himself in puzzlement.

He wasn't surprised, though.

Last time, he had obtained the shotgun monster's Beyonder characteristic
and turned it into a potion that he had already consumed.

*Since the time reversal didn't turn me back into an ordinary person,
and the Beyonder characteristic in my body hasn't disappeared, it means
that there's one less Hunter Beyonder characteristic here. The shotgun
monster is only back in its living state, but it essentially lacks
what's important. The question now is, why am I still the same before
the time reversal? *He couldn't come up with an answer, so he
decided to loot the copper coins from the shotgun monster and leave the
ruins.

*†*

The next morning, Lumian didn't feign a headache in front of his sister
like he had on March 30th. Instead, he got up early and prepared
breakfast, including toast, fried poached eggs, sliced bacon, and more.

Aurore was surprised to see Lumian's diligence. "Oh, you're so diligent?
I thought you wouldn't be able to get up this morning after drinking so
much yesterday."

Lumian casually replied, "Just a glass of Apple Whiskey Sour and a glass
of absinthe. How is that too much?"

Aurore shook her head and smiled. "What's there to be proud of? Other
than wine, other alcoholic beverages are unhealthy and affect our
brains. No wonder you're becoming more and more stupid, my drunkard
brother."

Lumian, who couldn't argue with his sister, muttered to himself, "Why is
wine an exception?"

"Because I like it," Aurore replied, challenging Lumian to retort.

Lumian had no response.

After breakfast, he stayed home and kneaded dough instead of going out.

Aurore clicked her tongue in wonder.

"Did you cause any trouble? You're so obedient...

"Tell me, I won't beat you up. At most, I'll give you an additional
combat class."

"Nothing." Lumian deflected the question and said, "I find things in the
village getting weirder and weirder. Some people are acting more and
more abnormally. Aurore, do you feel that way?"

Lumian had observed that his sister didn't have any memories related to
the time reversal, but the abnormality in the village had to have
started before March 29th. As a Mystery Pryer, Aurore might have sensed
it but didn't pay enough attention to it.

Aurore's expression turned serious.

"Even you can sense that something is amiss?

"Tell me, who were the ones who made you feel this way?"

*As expected, Aurore knew that there was something wrong with some
people, but she didn't expect the problem to be so serious...*
Lumian washed his hands and thought before responding, "Madame Pualis,
the padre, Pons Bénet, and the shepherd, Pierre Berry, who returned to
the village early."

"There is indeed something wrong with Madame Pualis. I knew something
was off about her when she came to Cordu with the administrator, but she
was very restrained. Apart from constantly having extramarital
relationships, there was nothing evil about her. I saw something on
her..."

Aurore stopped herself, not wanting to drag Lumian into the supernatural
world.

*Constantly having extramarital affairs?* Before Lumian found
out that Madame Pualis was having an affair with the padre, he found
Madame Pualis a decent lady. He was surprised to learn that Madame
Pualis had affairs with men other than the padre.

Of course, this was in line with Lumian's stereotypical view of Madame
Pualis.

"As for the padre, he has the same strong desire for superpowers as you,
but he has never received the blessings of the Eternal Blazing Sun
Church," Aurore continued. "A guy like Pons Bénet, whose brain is
nothing but muscle, can't do anything strange. As for the shepherd,
Pierre Berry, rushing back a few sheep seems a little off, but I can't
tell what's wrong, and I don't dare to look deeper..."

*As one would expect from a Sequence 7 of the Mystery Pryer pathway...
Before the time reversal, I hadn't conversed much with Grande Soeur
about such topics. In fact, I overlooked the crucial hint that there
could be an issue with Pierre Berry's sheep... Yes, I didn't suspect
Pierre Berry much back then. I just thought it was a bit odd for him to
hurry back early to take part in Lent...* Just as Lumian was
about to speak, there was a tinkling sound at the door.

The doorbell rang.

Lumian walked over to the door and asked, "Who is it?"

"A telegram for Aurore!" the person outside replied loudly.

"A telegram?" Aurore was confused. "Who would send me a telegram?
There's nothing urgent recently..."

Lumian was also puzzled.

They hadn't received any telegrams before the time reversal on March
30th.

Wait, Lumian thought. I went to the village square early on March 30th
to wait for Reimund. Perhaps Grande Soeur received a telegram but didn't
tell me. Lumian quickly opened the door.

Outside stood Bertrand, the administrator's subordinate in charge of
telegrams. He handed a piece of paper to Lumian and said, "1 verl d'or."

The brown-haired, brown-eyed Bertrand was not from Cordu and had come
here with the administrator from Dariège. He looked warm on the outside
but was actually quite greedy.

Lumian tossed a silver coin worth one verl d'or to Bertrand and looked
at the telegram.

The contents were simple. Lumian quickly browsed through it.

"The author salon mentioned before is in June. If you're willing, Miss
Aurore, you can set off for Trier now. Leave enough time for a tour. We
guarantee that this will be a very beautiful journey."

It was signed by the editorial department of Novel Weekly.

*Wh...* Lumian's eyes widened.

Was this a reply from Novel Weekly?

"When did I say I wanted to attend the author's salon?" Aurore leaned
over and read the telegram. "What's wrong with the editorial department
of Novel Weekly? It's annoying having to meet so many people at once!"

Bertrand was well away from the door by now. Lumian was stunned and
suddenly had a bold guess. The telegram in his hand was indeed a reply
from Novel Weekly, but it was a reply to the telegram he would send in a
few days!

To be more precise, the telegram he had sent before going back in time
had received a reply after the time reversal, and in his current
experience, that telegram had yet to be sent out!
