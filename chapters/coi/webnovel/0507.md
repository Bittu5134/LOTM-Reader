## Chapter 507: Dead End

Pierre and the bar waiter locked eyes with Lumian and the others, their
bloodshot gaze shifting from vacant to sheer terror.

In hushed tones, they uttered frantically, "You folks are aware... You
folks are aware that there's Derangement here..."

Abruptly, Pierre's face contorted, and he bellowed in hysteria, "None of
you can leave!

"Once the outsiders catch wind of this, we're all done for!"

He swiftly maneuvered through the steam locomotive's open window,
attempting to climb in and forcefully pull Lumian and the others out.

In response, Lugano rose to his feet, delivering a powerful blow with
his right fist.

With a resounding thud, Pierre slumped, unconscious, hanging awkwardly
from the window. The bar waiter, seemingly unhinged, trampled over the
fallen man, attempting to leap into the carriage.

Lugano struck again, his punch rendering the bloodshot-eyed bar waiter
unconscious. He slumped over Pierre, creating an unusual tableau.

*They didn't abnormally transform into monsters...* Lumian had
previously speculated that the two town folks had succumbed suddenly to
Derangement.

Turning to Lumian, Lugano inquired in a low voice, "What do we do?"

"What do we do?" Lumian echoed the Doctor's inquiry.

The unfolding events not only displayed an abnormality but also left him
with a sense of inner conflict and displacement.

The peculiar Derangement, causing people to lose their sanity and
transform into canine-like creatures, coupled with the consecutive onset
of various illnesses, unmistakably hinted at supernatural forces at
play. However, the mystery deepened as Pierre and the other townsfolk,
who were evidently concerned about keeping Derangement a secret, freely
disclosed the information to Lumian.

This apparent contradiction could be attributed to Pierre's overwhelming
mental stress, pushed to the brink. Lumian's mention of future sickness
served as the tipping point, prompting Pierre to instinctively guard the
secret from leaking when reminded.

Yet, the lingering question persisted: Why not escape?

Faced with an infectious and unstoppable Derangement, wouldn't it be
prudent for ordinary humans to flee Dardel and return once the plague
had subsided?

Even if they feared attracting attention from the authorities by
fleeing, a temporary escape into the nearby mountains after addressing
those potentially afflicted could provide a solution.

Unless there was some force preventing the citizens of Dardel from
escaping!

Lumian deduced this from various details.

The townsfolk were cognizant of similar Derangement cases elsewhere,
resulting in entire villages being wiped out by the authorities.
Normally, such incidents would be reported as a tragic disaster with
everyone buried.

After the initial infection, key figures like the cathedral's clergyman,
the police, and health department officials succumbed to madness,
severing Dardel's connection with regional authorities from the start.

It appeared as if an intelligent and dangerous individual deliberately
spread Derangement, employing tactics to hinder the townsfolk from
escaping.

Why would this mastermind allow Pierre and others to divulge the
situation to the Doctor on the steam locomotive?

If the steam train were to stay in Dardel, unable to reach Port Gati by
the next morning, it would undoubtedly attract official Beyonder
investigation.

Lumian, thinking from the mastermind's perspective, considered it
illogical to choose a transportation hub regularly frequented by steam
locomotives. Even without Lumian's inquiries, those choosing to enter
Dardel to sleep under a warm blanket and sample beautiful frogs would
eventually notice the abnormality, raising suspicions. They couldn't all
be made to stay behind, could they? This would lead to an investigation!

*There are many contradictions, inconsistencies, and inexplicable
aspects... He's smart yet foolish, cautious yet careless...*
Lumian, contemplating the intricacies, turned to Lugano and said, "What
else can we do? Of course, we have to find a way to inform the
authorities about this. Don't tell me you want to investigate the source
of the Derangement and save the residents here, do you? I didn't expect
you to be so noble."

Lugano smiled awkwardly. The latter possibility had never crossed his
mind.

"How should we inform the authorities?" he asked sincerely, admitting
his lack of experience in such matters.

"The simplest solution is to get the train police here and tell them
what Pierre said. Have them use the train's radio to contact the
relevant departments in the Faust area or the Upper Coastal Province,"
Lumian suggested casually.

However, Lugano hesitated, expressing concern, "B-but as witnesses,
we'll be invited to assist in the investigation. O-our identities are
fake, and even if we use your mystical item to change our appearances,
it's easy to expose that we're Beyonders under the influence of some
mysticism abilities."

Lumian pondered for a moment and offered an alternative with a smile,
"Then find an empty room on the platform, pile dozens of bundles of
explosives, and detonate them. The explosion will send the roof flying,
destroying the house. This way, the conductor and the train police will
report it quickly, and the officials in the Faust area will take notice.
When they investigate further, they'll discover the hidden problem in
Dardel. How about that? We won't need to personally show our faces in
this plan, right?"

Lugano considered the proposal but raised another concern, "When the
authorities investigate further, they'll discover that we've interacted
with Dardel's residents. They'll worry that we might also be in danger
of contracting Derangement. When the time comes, we won't be able to
pass the scrutiny."

Lumian felt a twinge of frustration, recalling how he and his sister had
been trapped in Cordu after the abnormality. Everything they did had its
cons.

He chuckled and said, "Then investigate the source of the Derangement
personally and blast it into pieces!

"This will completely resolve the problem without attracting the
officials' attention!"

Ludwig, who had consumed countless suppers, swallowed the deep-fried
potato pie in his mouth and calmly said, "After informing the
authorities about Derangement, why stay here and wait for them to
investigate?

"Can't we just leave, change our identities, and take another steam
locomotive to another port?"

*Uh...* Lumian was taken aback.

*Why hadn't I thought of such a simple idea?*

*Just now, the more Lugano and I discussed, the deeper we delved into a
dead end. We were entirely focused on finding a reason and excuse for
entering Dardel to investigate the source of the Derangement...*

A realization hit Lumian, and his heart skipped a beat.

Nonchalantly, he gazed at Lugano, assessing the Doctor's luck.

The other party's luck in the future would also be tainted with a
ghastly green!

With a smile, Lumian said to Lugano, "You also have the possibility of
contracting Derangement."

Lugano was taken aback for a moment before asking with a pale face,
"Really?"

"Think of it as a joke," Lumian turned his head, seemingly relaxed, and
said to Ludwig, "See, there are many benefits to studying more. In the
past, you wouldn't have thought of such a solution and only knew nothing
but eating."

Ignoring the Hunter, Ludwig forked a piece of mutton into his mouth.

"What should I do? What should I do..." Lugano muttered to himself,
attempting to use his Doctor powers on himself to see if he could be
saved.

Lumian interrupted him.

"No rush. There's just a risk of contracting the illness. You just need
to leave this place before you get truly infected."

As he spoke, he stood up and walked out of the private room.

"W-where are you going?" Lugano blurted out.

Lumian slipped his hands into his pockets and responded with a smile.
"Inform the authorities about Derangement."

Lugano was momentarily at a loss for words and expressions. All he could
do was watch in a daze as Lumian strolled out of the private room.

Reaching the train's washroom, Lumian locked the door and activated the
black mark representing Spirit World Traversal.

His figure swiftly vanished, reappearing in Apartment 702 at 9 Rue
Orosai, Quartier de la Cathédrale Commémorative in Trier.

Neither Franca nor Jenna was asleep at this hour. One was engrossed in a
novel, while the other contemplated what knowledge to impart to Rabbit
Chasel.

"W-why are you back?" Franca jumped in fright.

She had the illusion that she had just dropped him off at school in the
morning and found him at home, legs up, eating snacks, and watching
television in the afternoon.

Lumian glanced at Franca and smiled. "We encountered a Beyonder incident
and wish to inform the authorities through your channels to have them
resolve it."

Franca exclaimed in surprise and amusement, "Y-you encountered another
Beyonder incident? What a mysticism catastrophe detector!?"

Jenna looked at Lumian and suddenly felt that it was a good thing for
him to leave Trier.

"I didn't want to either." Lumian spread his hands sincerely.

Franca exhaled and said, "Where is it? What kind of incident?"

"In Dardel in Upper Coastal Province's Faust region..." Lumian briefly
recounted the situation.

Franca and Jenna were both surprised and terrified by the contagious
Derangement.

Simultaneously, Franca muttered inwardly, *I wonder how 007 will react
to this "surprise"...*

*He's always telling me to get out of the market district. If I really
do, he'll realize that not only will Beyonder cases in Trier's other
districts pile up on him, the mystical catastrophes of Intis's other
provinces will also descend upon him...*

*Ah, that's right. What does it have to do with me? It's all Lumian's
fault!*

*Thankfully, this fellow is heading to the Feynapotter Kingdom in the
future. No matter what Beyonder incidents he encounters, it's no longer
007's problem. He can't possibly collaborate across borders...*

After explaining the situation in Dardel, Lumian didn't linger. He
teleported back to the washroom of the steam locomotive's business
carriage.

He turned on the tap and washed his hands without hesitation. Then, he
left the washroom and returned to the small private room. He said to
Lugano, "The authorities will react soon. Let's prepare to leave."

Lugano sprang to his feet.

At that moment, the unconscious Pierre slowly regained consciousness,
shaking the bar waiter off his body and landing on the platform.

Lumian looked at him and smiled.

"We'll stay and investigate the source of Derangement. Can you tell me
who patient zero was?"

"Who was it..." Pierre didn't lose his mind and attack Lumian and the
others like before. Instead, he fell into deep thought.
