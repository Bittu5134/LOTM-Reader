## Chapter 997: Different Regions

Seeing that bizarrely shaped giant mushroom person, even Franca, a
veteran gamer, felt a sense of morbid curiosity and horror.

My goodness, what kind of monstrosity is this?

As expected of something evolved from a great existence's psychological
trauma, who knows if it's from Mr. Fool or the Celestial Worthy...

As similar thoughts flashed through her mind, Franca and Jenna tacitly
split to the sides, one hiding in the shadows, the other concealing her
form.

Luo Shan had never cooperated with them in Beyonder combat before, and
this was her first time encountering a monster without barriers
separating them. Moreover, this wasn't the domain of her Shaman
abilities, so she was momentarily at a loss.

She instinctively turned around, wanting to run back to the previous
hall, moving so fast she left an afterimage in place.

However, although she chose the double doors behind her, she was shocked
to find herself rapidly approaching the blood-red giant mushroom person
with white patterns.

At the same time, Franca emerged from the shadows.

She felt the shadows she was hiding in strangely come alive, as if
trying to control and erode her.

The next second, she and Luo Shan saw the giant mushroom person suddenly
swell and grow larger, a giant lava sword burning with pale blue flames
coalescing in its hand.

The giant mushroom person took a step closer, swinging down the great
sword that seemed formed of red-hot lava.

Franca didn't dodge backward, but instead shot forward, lowering her
body. Before the lava sword could strike, she darted past the scorching
heat waves to the mushroom person's side.

Jenna's body quickly outlined against the ceiling position, holding a
brass-colored revolver aimed at the giant mushroom's head.

Bang!

The giant mushroom person's sword strike hit the inexperienced Luo Shan,
shattering this Painter like a mirror.

The Mirror Substitution that Jenna and Franca had previously made for
Luo Shan finally came in handy.

The lava sword didn't stop after shattering Luo Shan, heavily striking
the corridor floor and sending out pale blue sulfur fireballs.

Rumble!

Jenna had just pulled the trigger, firing a bright yellow bullet at the
giant mushroom person's head, when she was engulfed by the chain
reaction of explosions.

Most of the corridor, including Franca and the giant mushroom person
itself, was affected by the explosion created by over a dozen sulfur
fireballs.

Franca and Jenna's Mirror Substitutions were passively triggered, their
bodies first thinning, then developing cracks, and finally shattering
into pieces.

When the explosive wind in the narrow environment subsided, the figures
of Franca, Jenna, and Luo Shan outlined at the giant mushroom person's
original position, at the end of this corridor, next to the other set of
double doors.

They saw that half of the giant mushroom person's head had collapsed,
oozing dark red blood, white mycelium, and tiny spores. They saw its
body similarly torn open by the explosion, revealing large wounds filled
with both mycelium and flesh.

As the flesh writhed and the mycelium grew, the giant mushroom person's
wounds rapidly healed.

Seeing this, Franca's scalp tingled. She turned around, pushed open the
door, and rushed out of this corridor.

She felt that fighting in this narrow environment wasn't advantageous
for them, while the terrifying mushroom person with its exaggerated
self-healing ability and explosive methods was clearly more in its
element!

So, she had to escape from here, firstly to try to shake off the giant
mushroom person, and secondly to find a scene more suitable for
Demonesses and a Painter to fight.

Jenna didn't hesitate, closely following Franca.

Luo Shan, who thought she would die, was surprised that the Mirror
Substitution actually worked, and having gained experience, chose to
imitate Franca and Jenna's actions.

The trio quickly passed through the open door, entering a new dimly lit
corridor.

Behind them, the two halves of the wooden door swayed several times
before finally closing completely.

Franca moved forward while vigilantly observing whether the giant
mushroom person was pursuing them, but found that behind the door was
dead silence, with no further movement.

"Uh... does each type of psychological trauma only operate in a fixed
area?" Franca slowed her pace, making a guess based on her experience
and imagination.

Jenna nodded, looking around and said, "Now we need to be alert to the
psychological trauma in this area?"

"What psychological trauma?" Luo Shan looked confused.

"Monsters similar to that mushroom person just now," Franca explained
simply.

Luo Shan's eyes turned slightly, and she blurted out, "Monsters
transformed from Zhou Mingrui's psychological trauma?"

Very smart... Franca pondered for a moment and said, "It also includes
the psychological trauma of evil forces."

Luo Shan was silent for two seconds, about to say something more when
she suddenly started coughing.

"Cough cough cough..." She paused and said, "Why do I feel like I've
suddenly fallen ill?"

Disease? Can that mushroom person also create mystical pathogens? Jenna
and I are both Demoness of Affliction with some resistance to Disease
abilities. Brief contact won't infect us, but Luo Shan can't resist,
showing symptoms? The symptoms appeared very quickly, this isn't at the
level of Sequence 7... After Zhou Mingrui was stimulated, did the power
level of the dream city change, starting from the underground part of
Mushu Hospital, with no corresponding manifestation in the outside world
yet? Jenna vaguely understood the reason and took out a bottle of
healing agent from her Traveler's Bag.

She didn't rush to provide treatment for Luo Shan, but pondered and
asked, "Can you draw efficacious medicine for yourself?"

Even if the drawn medicine had a limited duration, it could truly cure
diseases---as long as all the mystical pathogens were eliminated before
the effect wore off, it would work!

At this time, Franca had also figured out the reason and muttered, "That
mushroom person is too terrifying!

"What kind of monster is this exactly!"

Luo Shan already felt her forehead burning up. She shook her head and
said,

"I don't know exactly what this disease is, nor do I know what medicine
to draw to cure it."

"Then drink this." Jenna handed the healing agent to Luo Shan.

She and Franca always maintained a state of having two bottles of
healing agent on them, with previously consumed ones either coming from
Lumian or being replenished by him.

After experiencing the substitute's death, Luo Shan now fully trusted
Franca and Jenna. She took the healing agent, immediately unscrewed the
cap, and gulped it down.

In just about ten seconds, she blinked and said, "I think I'm fine now,
the illness is gone...

"It's really amazing!"

"Your ability to draw is also amazing," Franca said humbly, pointing to
the end of the current corridor, "Let's continue forward, we need to
find the elevator lobby quickly, otherwise who knows what we'll
encounter..."

She was still shaken by that giant mushroom person.

Jenna and Luo Shan felt the same, quickening their pace to follow behind
Franca.

They had just taken two or three steps when the double doors at the end
of the corridor suddenly swung open.

Franca and Jenna reflexively used Invisibility, then considered how to
help Luo Shan hide.

Luo Shan had somewhat adapted to the current situation. Using a pencil,
she quickly drew a simple, inconspicuous, childlike doodle of a door on
the side wall in just two seconds.

This door had no markings and wouldn't lead anywhere. Luo Shan placed
her palm on the handle and yanked it backward sharply.

The door, just drawn on the wall, miraculously opened, revealing a dark
area about the size of Room 2303's bathroom.

Luo Shan hid inside, then carefully closed the paper-thin door.

The wall surface was left with only a few faint, barely noticeable
pencil marks resembling a door outline.

By this time, the double doors at the end of the corridor had fully
opened, and an orderly wearing light blue clothing and a white mask
slowly entered the current area, pushing a transfer bed.

Franca held her breath and turned her gaze towards the orderly and the
transfer bed.

She saw that the orderly's eyes were both empty and wooden, yet seemed
to hide deep malice. She saw that the surface of the transfer bed was
covered with a thin blanket, but there was no patient or corpse sleeping
on it.

What made the back of Franca's neck go cold was that the thin blanket
appeared to be in a bulging state, yet there was clearly nothing
underneath it.

Covering an invisible object? Franca and Jenna pressed their backs
tightly against the side wall, trying hard to increase the distance
between themselves and the orderly and the transfer bed.

Amidst the sound of wheels rolling over floor cracks, the orderly
maintained a slow, stiff posture, pushing the transfer bed past Franca
and Jenna, towards the double doors leading to the corridor with the
giant mushroom person.

Only when this transfer bed had pushed open the doors, slowly left the
current area, and disappeared from their sight did Franca and Jenna end
their Invisibility and return to the middle of the corridor.

Luo Shan also opened the door on the wall and nimbly leaped out.

She didn't forget to casually "close the door".

"How did you know it was safe to come out?" Jenna, who was about to
knock on the door, asked.

Luo Shan raised the pencil in her hand and said with a smile, "I drew a
peephole inside."

"Mm, let's continue looking for the elevator lobby." Franca took the
lead without hesitation.

Just as they reached the exit at the end of the corridor, that set of
double doors suddenly swung open.

It had opened again, when Franca, Jenna, and Luo Shan were less than
three meters away from it.

Mushu Hospital, Emergency Center.

Based on his experience from the last hospital visit, Zhou Mingrui
described the symptoms of acute gastroenteritis and successfully
obtained a lab test order from the doctor.

He took this order and turned into the right passageway, heading towards
the emergency blood drawing area.

While waiting for his number to be called at the blood drawing area, he
clutched his stomach, pretending he could no longer hold on, and quickly
left the area, entering the first-floor lobby and walking towards the
nearest public restroom.

During this process, he naturally looked around, seeing if he could find
any odd details.

He hadn't discovered anything in the emergency center before.

The nearest public restroom was adjacent to elevators 6 to 10. In the
dim light, Zhou Mingrui quickly circled to the elevator lobby.

He pressed both "Up" and "Down" simultaneously, observing the elevators'
operation.

Soon, two elevators arrived on the first floor, their doors opening
almost simultaneously.

Zhou Mingrui glanced left and right, finding nothing unusual about the
upward elevator, but the downward one gave him a feeling of leading to
hell, to the source of fear.

Is Mushu Hospital's problem underground? Zhou Mingrui silently mused to
himself.
