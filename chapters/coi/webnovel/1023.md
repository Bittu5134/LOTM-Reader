## Chapter 1023: Three Sentences

When she heard Huang Tao's emotional and gratified remarks, Queen Mystic
Bernadette's lips moved almost imperceptibly a few times, but in the end
she didn't speak.

She pressed her lips tightly together.

Huang Tao's gaze looked out towards the open door and the corridor
outside. He smiled slightly and said, "Before I leave, I'll give you all
a gift."

As soon as he finished speaking, all the mirrors in the study lit up
with a clear radiance.

Huang Tao's figure instantly disappeared from where he had been
standing.

*Trying to run?* Franca, who was hidden in the shadows of the
corridor in an Invisible state, instinctively rushed out.

She suspected that the mirrored Roselle had deliberately appealed to
emotions just now, preventing Queen Mystic from reacting immediately,
allowing Him to escape using the mirror world.

The next second, Franca, still in her Invisible state, saw Bernadette
transform into ethereal and complex information, rushing like a torrent
into the mirror in front of her.

Queen Mystic closely pursued the mirrored Emperor Roselle.

Franca didn't hesitate. She reached out her right palm and pressed
towards that mirror from a distance.

Her body suddenly leaned forward, quickly becoming ethereal, and passed
through the glass mirror surface.

Anthony, who had snuck in using Psychological Invisibility, quickly ran
into the study. Then Lumian, who had directly teleported over while
holding Ludwig's hand, grabbed his shoulder and brought him into the
mirror world.

They followed the traces left behind by the mirrored Emperor Roselle,
constantly moving forward through deep tunnels spread like spider webs
in the ethereal darkness.

They pursued like this for several dozen seconds. The tunnels around
them gradually became sparser, the darkness growing ever deeper.

Finally, the mirrored Emperor Roselle in Huang Tao's form stopped and
turned around.

He was positioned at the edge of an area of void and deep darkness, but
behind Him there were no more tunnels, only pure, profound darkness
remaining.

In the depths of that darkness, faint gray fog could vaguely be seen
spreading, with an endless city hidden in the mist, like a mirage, yet
indistinct.

*Thump, thump!*

Bernadette, Lumian, Franca and the others heard the sound of heartbeats.
It seemed to be both their own and also coming from the very bottom of
that deep darkness.

"There are some things that can be said now," said the mirrored Emperor
Roselle in Huang Tao's form, smiling again.

One more step back and He would retreat into that pure, deep darkness.

"What things?" Bernadette's voice was a bit lower and hoarser than
before.

Huang Tao smiled and said, "The gift is three sentences.

"First, I have preliminarily achieved my purpose for entering this real
dream, in every aspect."

As He said this, the mirrored Roselle was gazing at Queen Mystic
Bernadette. The subtext seemed to be saying: my greatest purpose was to
find an opportunity to truly spend a few days with my princess as father
and daughter.

Bernadette fell silent.

But Lumian was thinking.

*The purposes in every aspect have been achieved?*

*The task given by the one worshiped by the Aurora Order has been
completed, and the one given by the Celestial Worthy has also been
completed?*

*What could that be?*

The mirrored Emperor Roselle seemed to guess what Lumian, Franca and
Anthony were thinking, and laughed, saying, "It's the same as what
you're thinking."

Before Lumian and the others could ask further, Huang Tao, with a
somewhat complex expression, said to Queen Mystic Bernadette, "The
second sentence: It is possible for people inside and outside the mirror
to merge."

Hearing this, Lumian and Franca both suddenly remembered something
Krismona had said to Jenna: Reconcile with your mirror self!

*Is this a different expression of the same idea? It doesn't seem
so---reconciliation isn't the same as merging...* When Lumian
looked towards Franca in front of him, he found she was also looking at
him.

Bernadette remained silent, not responding to the mirrored Roselle's
words.

Huang Tao sighed with a smile, "The last sentence: The apocalypse may
come earlier than prophesied. Be prepared."

After saying this, He looked at Bernadette and said in a joking tone,
"There are five Four Heavenly Kings, and four sentences in three
sentences. It's very reasonable.

"There's one more sentence..."

The mirrored Emperor Roselle paused for a moment, then smiled tenderly
at Queen Mystic.

"These past few days, dad has been very happy, truly.

"Remember, I will never put you in a difficult position..."

Bernadette opened her mouth, but still didn't speak.

As Huang Tao spoke, He retreated into the pure darkness outside the
current area.

His body rapidly changed, transforming from a fashionable middle-aged
man into an alluring woman with long chestnut hair, blue eyes, a high
nose bridge, thin lips, a voluptuous figure, and a mature aura.

The dream's repulsive force suddenly descended upon Her, seemingly
triggered by Her entry into the deep darkness of this part of the mirror
world.

The mirrored Emperor Roselle maintained a gentle smile and continued
speaking to Bernadette, "I hate him very much, dislike him, but my
feelings in other aspects are the same as his, even more extreme, more
irrational.

"I've already left a lawyer-witnessed letter saying I'm going to travel
freely for a while, indulge for a while, and that you'll handle various
matters of the Intis Group on my behalf."

Without waiting for Bernadette to respond, She specially reminded, "You
should all retreat further; otherwise, you'll also be affected and
rejected by the dream."

Saying this, the mirrored Emperor Roselle looked at Lumian and smiled,
saying, "We'll meet again. I've also left a gift for you in the desk
drawer."

*A gift?* Feeling the dream's repulsive force spreading over,
Lumian, Franca and the others quickly retreated into one of the mirror
tunnels.

The mirrored Emperor Roselle's figure gradually faded, seeming both to
dissolve into that deep darkness and to be pushed out of the dream by
some force.

She smiled at Bernadette, who was still standing in place. "Quickly
leave this area."

Bernadette instinctively stepped back, her eyes already misty.

Suddenly, she hummed a melody, a melody very familiar to the mirrored
Emperor Roselle.

The mirrored Roselle was stunned for a moment, becoming somewhat dazed.

Then, She began humming along, singing the lyrics corresponding to that
melody.

"The stars in the sky don't speak, the babies on earth miss their
mothers..."

Expressions of reminiscence, gratification, and emotion appeared on the
mirrored Roselle's face. She persisted until Bernadette's figure
disappeared into one of the mirror tunnels, only then giving up the
resistance.

Her figure rapidly vanished, dissolving into the darkness.

The dream's repulsive force completely enveloped this area, only fully
receding after several dozen seconds.

After a while, Bernadette, Lumian and the others returned here.

"She has indeed been permanently kicked out of the dream," said Queen
Mystic in a low voice after looking around.

*Smoother than I imagined...* Lumian didn't say this out loud.

He felt it would upset Queen Mystic.

And for those in High-Sequence Beyonders, an emotional outburst had a
potential hidden danger---the possibility of losing control.

Bernadette was silent for a moment, then took the initiative to say,
"Any thoughts on those three sentences just now?"

Lumian had already analyzed. "The second sentence, about the possibility
of merging between the original body and the Mirror Person, likely has
exaggerated and false components.

"The third sentence aligns with some of my thoughts and guesses. It
might not be false---the apocalypse may really come early.

"For the first sentence, I'm inclined to believe it's true."

"So She also completed the task given by the Celestial Worthy?" Franca
asked with considerable worry.

She immediately guessed, "These past few days, when we weren't paying
attention, did She do something to Zhou Mingrui, laying the groundwork?"

"No," Bernadette slowly shook her head, "These past few days, I've been
watching her openly and secretly. She shouldn't have had the chance to
directly contact Zhou Mingrui."

Lumian, looking at the pure darkness outside the area and the faintly
visible gray fog and city in the depths of the darkness, said
thoughtfully,

"Perhaps Her existence itself has some symbolism, enabling Her to
complete the task given by the Celestial Worthy."

Before Franca and the others could ask, he pointed to the depths of the
darkness and said,

"Doesn't that look like the sealed Fourth Epoch Trier?"

Franca vaguely grasped Lumian's idea and blurted out. "A special mirror
world?"

Lumian nodded slightly and said to Queen Mystic,

"Mr. Fool's dream originally shouldn't have contained the sealed Fourth
Epoch Trier and the special mirror world that's produced from attaching
to the Fourth Epoch Trier."

This was deduced from Mr. Fool's experiences.

Lumian continued, "But after the mirrored Emperor Roselle entered, Her
essence and special nature gave Her corresponding symbolic meaning. So,
in the depths of the dream city's mirror world, that special mirror
world and the sealed Fourth Epoch Trier gradually took shape.

"And we previously speculated that one of Zarathushtra's main goals was
to have Zhou Mingrui drink the Witch potion, producing a stable,
long-term, corresponding Mirror Person. Then, the Celestial Worthy could
use that Mirror Person to accomplish some things, achieving a phased
victory."

Queen Mystic nodded slightly. "Apart from consuming the 'Witch' potion,
another way to make a person produce a stable, long-term Mirror Person
is to come into contact with that special mirror world."

"Zarathushtra was both looking for opportunities to induce Zhou
Mingrui's advancement himself and introducing the mirrored Emperor
Roselle so as to bring the special mirror world? A two-pronged
approach!" Franca drew in a sharp breath.

Queen Mystic said in a somewhat low voice, "Zhou Mingrui probably hasn't
come into contact with the special mirror world yet, hasn't produced a
corresponding Mirror Person, but afterwards, the Celestial Worthy's side
will certainly have corresponding arrangements."

For example, achieving it through Zhou Sasa? Franca suddenly looked at
Lumian.

Lumian nodded and continued, "So, we can't delay our actions.

"We are on the precipice; there's no backing down."

"Yes," Franca agreed.

Returning to Huang Tao's study, Bernadette walked around behind the desk
and, guided by spirituality, pulled open a drawer.

There was a "gift" left for Lumian by the mirrored Emperor Roselle.

Lumian, coming around from the other side, suddenly saw a card.

The card lay quietly on top of a stack of documents, its surface
depicting the image of the mirrored Emperor Roselle from earlier.

Voluptuous figure, wearing a black dress, adorned with a golden crown
inlaid with jewels, alluring features, mature aura, outstanding charm.

In the upper left corner of this card, a line of text was condensed from
brilliant starlight: "Sequence 0: Primordial Demoness"

At this moment, Bernadette's voice rang out, echoing in the ears of
Lumian and the others, "A Card of Blasphemy, the Demoness card."
