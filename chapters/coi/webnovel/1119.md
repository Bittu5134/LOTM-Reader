## Chapter 1119: Returning Home

After leaving the luxurious villa that used to be her own but now housed
Lumian and his companions, Madam Justice paused for two seconds and said
to Susie, who was beside her, "Let's go home."

"Home?" Susie's tone suddenly became a little dreamy.

"Yes, back to Backlund." Madam Justice smiled. Her green eyes sparkled
brightly, filled with anticipation and hope, as if she had returned to
her girlhood.

Susie fully understood Audrey's meaning, and a nostalgic expression
appeared on her canine face. "Okay."

Over the years, she and Audrey had returned to Backlund on occasion.
After the crimson moon's descent, they even stayed there for long
periods, secretly protecting the Hall family. But this time, Audrey
wanted to truly return home---to be with her parents and other loved
ones.

Justice Audrey's figure quickly became ethereal, carrying Susie, who was
now a Manipulator, as they traversed the sea of collective
subconsciousness.

Her voice, tinged with obvious emotion, lingered at the spot before
gradually fading into the wind, "The prelude to the final battle is
about to begin. If I don't go home now, there won't be another chance. I
don't want to face the true apocalypse with regrets..."

Loen Kingdom, Backlund.

Justice Audrey and Susie emerged from the sea of collective
subconsciousness onto a street close to Empress Borough.

They didn't rush home but instead strolled along the street, savoring
the mundane pleasures of daily life.

No one noticed them, nor did anyone realize that the daughter of Earl
Hall was wandering through the crowd without a maid or bodyguard,
looking around curiously.

At this time, well-dressed gentlemen in silk top hats and ladies with
parasols were moving in and out of department stores, upscale cafés, and
opera houses. Two- or four-seater carriages hurried by, while a small
circus performed by the fountain, surrounded by children. In the
distance, a steam-powered four-wheeled vehicle chugged away, its
vibrations gradually fading into the road.

Justice Audrey observed the scene with focused attention, making no
effort to hide her nostalgia.

Suddenly, she sensed something unusual and turned her gaze toward a man
and a woman about to board a four-seater carriage.

The man was dressed in a black suit, and the woman wore a yellow,
flowing gown of sheer fabric with a fresh touch of makeup.

The moment Justice Audrey looked their way, the pair froze abruptly.

Plants---some brownish, others greenish---burst wildly from their tear
ducts, nostrils, mouths, ear canals, and even pores. There were branches
and vines.

Their bloodshot eyes, now tainted with a crimson hue, radiated intense
malice as they turned to glare at the coachman and the surrounding
pedestrians.

However, they seemed to "decide" to hold back, waiting until they were
in a better state before launching an attack.

But their transformations did not go unnoticed. Screams of terror
pierced the peaceful and lively street, echoing far and wide.

The pedestrians fled desperately. In just seconds, the area around the
man and woman became desolate.

Their madness erupted. With a loud bang, chunks of flesh mixed with
green plants and crimson moonlight splattered outward.

Soon, a team of Nighthawks bearing the Dark Sacred Emblem arrived.

They swiftly dealt with the nauseating flesh and remnants.

The fleeing pedestrians suddenly slowed, some returning to their
conversations with companions, others stepping into nearby cafés to
order coffee with desserts, appearing relaxed and at ease.

The coachman returned to his carriage, gazing into the distance, waiting
for passengers.

None of them paid any attention to the Nighthawks' cleanup or even
glanced in their direction.

It was as if they had completely forgotten what had just happened,
returning to their daily lives.

Justice Audrey stood watching for a while, sighed, and continued walking
toward Empress Borough.

Before long, she and Susie entered the sea of collective
subconsciousness again, emerging in a corner of her long-unvisited
bedroom.

Inside, another Audrey, dressed in a green-and-white gown, sat at the
dressing table, fastening a pair of petite pearl earrings.

She turned her body and looked at Justice Audrey, her expression
lighting up with joy. "You're finally back!"

She then asked in a verifying tone, "You've become an Angel?"

Justice Audrey smiled and nodded. "Yes. It took a long time to prepare
for the ritual, but I completed it three months ago."

The advancement ritual for a Sequence 2 Discerner in the Spectator
pathway required delving into the subconscious of at least ten thousand
humans, uncovering their deepest fears, most primal desires, and the
root of all their psychological issues, then leaving a mark of oneself.

This was not only tedious but also dangerous. Every human carried
godhood and was subject to the erosion and influence of the sea of
collective subconsciousness, inheriting the most profound cognition and
impressions of ancient humanity. Chaos, madness, and primal instincts
lurked deep within their subconscious. Exploring these depths risked
corruption, mental instability, or even derangement.

In this ritual, the quantitative requirement could be reduced by
targeting higher-ranked Beyonders, but this entailed greater risks. For
example, delving into the subconscious of Madam Magician could mean
encountering the mental imprints or past shadows of The Celestial Worthy
of Heaven and Earth for Blessings. Choosing Lumian as a target would
suffice for the ritual but would involve facing the most primal and
frenzied mind, even glimpses of the Original Creator or the Primordial
God Almighty.

"Wasn't that dangerous?" Audrey, now wearing her pearl earrings, asked
with curiosity.

Though over twenty years old, with mature demeanor and temperament, a
trace of girlish innocence lingered in her tone.

Justice Audrey smiled. "It was indeed dangerous. During the preparation,
I witnessed the worst of human nature, the wildest desires, the most
chaotic perceptions, and also the noblest virtues, the most beautiful
emotions, and the highest ideals. Sometimes, these contradictory
elements existed simultaneously in a single person's subconscious."

"Human nature is complex," Audrey agreed with a nod.

After observing Justice Audrey for a few seconds, she sighed and asked
nostalgically, "You've been to many places over the years, haven't you?"

Justice Audrey smiled gently. "I lived in East Borough for a year, then
south of Trier's Quartier du Jardin Botanique for another year. I spent
a year in the Southern Continent and nearly two years along the coastal
cities of Midseashire. Those are lands of steel and steam. Their
architecture resembles towering iron trees standing close together,
their 'branches' interconnected. Each 'bark' and 'leaf' is a room
housing a family of workers. Only a few 'leaves' and 'bark' receive
sunlight..."

Audrey listened intently, as if she too had traveled to those places and
witnessed those sights.

After a long pause, she asked with anticipation, "Do you have an answer
now?"

"There isn't one answer to all questions." Justice Audrey gave a
self-deprecating smile. "I only understand one thing now: Humanity must
unite and show collective strength to the deities to gain a higher
status, just as workers, farmers, herders, and clerks must overcome fear
and band together to demand better treatment and greater security from
those in power.

"That's why we cannot side with beings born as gods. They don't need
anchors; humanity is meaningless to Them. If They achieve ultimate
victory, our existence, joys, and sorrows will depend solely on Their
whims and chaotic intentions, leaving us utterly powerless."

Audrey caught the melancholy and worry in Justice's tone and playfully
comforted her, "We may not need those born as gods, but we were born
noble."

"No." Justice Audrey shook her head and said with a faint smile,
"Nobility isn't about lineage, status, or position; it's about one's
heart and character."

She extended her right hand toward Audrey, who was dressed in the
green-and-white gown.

"Welcome home\~" Audrey said with a smile, lightly clapping her hand
against Justice Audrey's.

With a crisp clap, the two figures suddenly merged into one, inseparable
ever again.

Audrey now donned the green-and-white gown, fastened the pearl earrings,
and applied simple makeup. Leaving the bedroom, she descended the
stairs, passed through the hall, and arrived on the second floor of the
ballroom, accompanied by a lady's maid and Susie.

Crystal chandeliers hung overhead, an orchestra played, and men and
women in formal attire mingled elegantly, chatting in small groups with
drinks in hand or dancing gracefully in pairs on the ballroom floor.

Audrey took a glass of pale-golden champagne from a passing tray and
stood by the railing, gazing down with a gentle smile. She watched her
father, Earl Hall, her mother, Lady Caitlyn, and the familiar nobles
chatting, as well as her elder brothers waltzing with their partners.

She didn't join them, content to watch with a smile.

Late that night, the entire population of Backlund shared the same
dream.

In the dream, a voice seemed to say: *"Mr. Medici, Lumian Lee wants to
meet you. You may choose the time and place."*

Normally, this voice would only echo in the dreams or minds of
Backlund's residents, slowly spreading to other cities and nations
through the sea of collective subconsciousness. This time, however, it
reached beings outside Backlund almost instantly, with hardly any delay.

†

*"Mr. Medici, Lumian Lee wants to meet you. You may choose the time and
place."*

Red Angel Medici, with His feet propped up on a table, scratched His ear
and sneered.

"Only now did he muster the courage to make this decision?

"I've been waiting nearly a year."
