## Chapter 940: Repaying the Loan

Lumian and Jenna could deeply relate to Franca's concerns.

They had encountered a Pixie in reality before, a higher Sequence
Beyonder of the Painter pathway, but they had never imagined that
something as simple as a photo sent through the information network
could carry such terrifying supernatural power.

"Yes." Jenna nodded. "We need to think more about what different
pathways of Beyonders can achieve in the dream city that they couldn't
in reality and prepare accordingly."

Though the dream city suppressed all Beyonder powers to the level of
Sequence 7, its unique characteristics and the details of its social
functioning had brought about possibilities that exceeded their previous
expectations.

Of course, Lumian and the others had already begun to discuss how
certain Beyonder powers from the Demoness and Hunter pathways could
interact with the dream city in unexpected ways. However, they had yet
to thoroughly explore the potential changes other pathways might undergo
as a result.

Their current conclusions were:

The Hunter and Demoness pathways, which symbolized calamity, could
exploit the unique features of the dream city positively, like using the
abundance of mirrors to set up Mirror Mazes and cast different mirror
spells at any time and place, or utilizing screens as a medium to access
previously unreachable or nonexistent surveillance worlds and other
dimensional spaces.

On the negative side, there were many more uses, which, as Franca put
it, involved actions that would violate criminal laws, and not just any
violations, but those that would warrant severe penalties. Examples
included using the Internet to seduce others and spread pleasure,
amplifying the destructive power of a Pyromaniac by triggering natural
gas explosions, or leveraging the dense buildings and population to
better and faster spread diseases, among others.

There were countless other more detailed and everyday uses as well.

After discussing this for a while, Lumian said to Jenna, "For now,
Franca will stay here for a while. She can observe Luo Shan during the
day and approach her as a colleague."

Jenna had already had a hunch, and she looked at Franca with a delighted
expression, asking, "Have you joined the Intis Group?"

Franca smiled nonchalantly. "Of course."

She then recounted how she had prepared for the interview and how she
had adjusted her plan upon seeing Miss Huang also participating.

"When do you both start officially?" Jenna asked with concern.

Franca replied with a hint of pride, "I have three days to sort out my
affairs. Lumian has to report tomorrow."

The identity that Madam Justice had created for Franca was that of a
25-year-old white-collar worker with three years of experience, someone
who had changed fields right after graduation and no longer worked in
her original profession.

Franca had been worried that the work experience on her resume might be
an issue since it was fabricated. However, when she pretended to be a
background checker from a certain company and made a phone call, she was
surprised to find that there really was someone named "Luo Fu" who
matched her profile closely.

This led her to suspect that the company might be secretly connected to
Madam Justice or other Major Arcana card holders in the dream city.
Alternatively, before Madam Justice was expelled, she might have used
her ability to weave the dream and pre-embedded some identities that
could be utilized. After identifying the bearer of the five lucky coins,
she might have painstakingly and time-consumingly altered the names,
appearances, and other information.

"Anything you need to prepare?" Jenna asked, intending to find out if
she could help in any way.

Franca's expression suddenly fell. "I need to buy a skirt, stockings,
and high heels..."

It had been a long time since she had consumed the Witch potion, and the
most she had worn was a skirt-pants combination. She had never actually
worn a skirt, let alone the other items!

"It's part of the dress code," Lumian explained on her behalf.

Jenna understood Franca's reluctance and, with a flicker of her eyes,
said, "Have you forgotten the acting method? Forgotten the roles you've
played before?

"This is just another form of acting. It's not about digesting the
potion this time but about getting close to Mr. Fool's dream
manifestation and secretly dealing with the lurking subordinates of the
Celestial Worthy and the evil gods' followers, thwarting their schemes.

"Remember, you're just acting."

Franca had already made up her mind, and now she was just finding more
reasons to justify it. So, Jenna's Instigation easily worked, and
Franca's expression softened.

Jenna looked at her and smiled slightly. "I'll wear the same kind of
outfit as you. If we're all dressed the same, there won't be any
awkwardness or shame."

Franca's eyes lit up. "Sure!"

Since she had decided to make this sacrifice, getting some perks was a
welcome bonus!

Lumian stayed silent, letting Franca and Jenna continue their
conversation, wary of being roped into making a similar promise.

He checked the time on his phone and reminded the two Demonesses, "Even
though we didn't confront Luo Shan's sketch directly, the fact that we
managed to delete that kind of photo itself is suspicious. If Luo Shan
notices it's gone, she'll likely test us again or even take more drastic
action. You two need to stay vigilant."

"Mm, I was thinking the same thing just now," Franca and Jenna responded
almost in unison.

Lumian waved them off and left.

Once he was gone, Franca plopped down on the couch, relaxing as she
smiled at Jenna.

"Let's go shopping for clothes tomorrow. We have money now; the lottery
winnings are in!"

Jenna visibly breathed a sigh of relief at this news.

She cautiously suggested, "Should we pay off those micro loans first?"

She had seen many people in Quartier du Jardin Botanique and Le Marché
du Quartier du Gentleman who borrowed from loan sharks, only to
eventually destroy themselves and their families, dragging down the ones
they loved most. So, even after entering the dream city, she was always
extremely cautious when it came to taking out micro loans.

"I was hoping to save up some money to rent those good items from Star
Dream Provisions Store..." Franca hesitated for two seconds before
saying, "Fine, let's pay off the loans first. This might even increase
the credit limit, which could come in handy at critical moments when we
need to go all in."

Before transmigrating, she had seen many cases of people borrowing micro
loans and having their lives ruined as a result.

Now, as a fairly experienced Beyonder, she knew that money could be used
to rent the magic mirror Arrodes, and she understood that in the dream
city, money was likely a symbol representing valuable resources. The
"offense-defense battle" that occurred during the prize redemption
process further solidified this theory.

From this perspective, carrying outstanding micro loans indeed seemed
risky. While it could serve as an emergency solution in the short term,
dragging it out over a long period or relying on them to sustain daily
life was not a wise choice.

Jenna also sat down on the couch and urged Franca to repay the online
loan on the spot. She then transferred some money to her teammates to
help them repay their loans as well.

"Only 120,000 left..." Franca sighed.

Jenna changed the subject, and the two of them chatted about their
recent experiences, sharing their thoughts on daily life.

In the end, Jenna couldn't help but ask again, "How exactly can we
awaken Mr. Fool?"

They had discussed this question many times before, but still had no
concrete ideas. They could only observe and make contact, hoping to find
clues and inspiration.

Franca shook her head and sighed.

"I don't know. The Major Arcana have tried everything they could think
of, from directly reminding him of the existence of Beyonder powers to
filming a movie that fully depicted his experiences in the hope of
triggering his memory. None of it worked, and they were quickly expelled
from the dream as a result..."

She hadn't known before, but now she understood that the movie they shot
was The Great Pirate 3.

"It seems like no one has tried directly telling Zhou Mingrui the
truth..." Jenna recalled.

"We're not sure if that would work, but it would certainly lead to being
expelled from the dream quickly," Franca replied with a self-deprecating
smile. "Still, if we have enough attempts left, we could isolate someone
and let them give it a shot."

Late at night, the two Demonesses washed up and went to bed, each
occupying a pillow.

They had already discussed how to deal with any probes Luo Shan might
carry out next. Now, without saying much, they exchanged a glance and
tacitly pulled up their blankets, closing their eyes in the cool air
brought by the air conditioner.

Using ice to cool the room would be too easily detected by any potential
watchers as an indication of Beyonder powers.

Once again, Jenna's Astral Projection ventured out and saw many spirits
wandering around, along with the blurry, illusory buildings, the frozen
storm, and the semi-transparent barrier.

She didn't immediately check on Luo Shan's situation. Instead, she kept
her eyes unfocused and her gaze blank, floating and moving back and
forth naturally under the guidance of her spirituality.

During this process, she saw Franca, who was also in a similar state.

Finally, Jenna's body turned toward the semi-transparent barrier
adjacent to the deep darkness.

There was no one there.

Luo Shan wasn't there fighting off the monsters trying to invade!

Jenna's heart tightened, but she maintained her previous state,
continuing to wander in her Astral Projection.

After a while, her gaze naturally rose, and she saw Luo Shan.

Luo Shan, dressed in a pale yellow skirt-pants combination, was floating
high up, quietly watching her and Franca with deep eyes. It was
impossible to tell how long she had been watching.

Jenna's nerves instantly tightened, but thanks to her acting skills, she
showed no signs of abnormality. Franca remained just as natural.

After a long, intense stare, Luo Shan flew toward the area where strange
creatures were attempting to invade. From behind the semi-transparent
barrier, she blocked their attacks and drove them back repeatedly.

Neither Franca nor Jenna let their guard down. Like background
characters, they dutifully repeated simple actions and irregular
movements.

Suddenly, both felt a sense of danger and woke up instantly from their
sleep.

They smelled a sickening, foul odor and saw a pair of brown-yellow eyes
staring at them from the night clinging to the ceiling.

In the darkness, a pair of wings covered in brown feathers, like those
of a giant owl, spread out.
