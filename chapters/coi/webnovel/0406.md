## Chapter 406: Inevitability-like Ending

Staring at the unconscious enemy in the corridor, Lumian refrained from
an immediate attack. He squatted down in silence.

He retrieved a bottle of sedative obtained from the Bliss Society's
Rentas, unscrewed the cap, and brought it to the patient's nose.

Franca glanced over and advised, "Remove the broken arrow from his chest
first. Otherwise, I think his body can handle most of the sedative's
effects."

The grayish-white stone-like scales on the Beyonder suspected to be I
Know Someone slowly dissipated due to the unconsciousness in
spirituality brought about by the Spell of Harrumph.

Lumian nodded and used the hand holding the bottle cap to carefully
remove the obsidian arrow.

Franca breathed a sigh of relief and continued, "The question now is how
do we confirm if this guy is the real I Know Someone.

"A powerful Hypnotist can manipulate a Beyonder of the same pathway and
Sequence, altering their self-awareness and making them believe they are
'I Know Someone.' They can substitute the real deal to appear in all
sorts of occasions, completing different pranks and fight any
adversaries.

"Fuck, why does it seem more troublesome than dealing with a
Marionettist!?"

What Franca meant was that the enemy in front of her might also be a
victim, someone whose perceptions had been altered to make them believe
they were "I Know Someone."

This possibility couldn't be ruled out, so she wasn't capable of
steeling herself to kill him before channeling his spirit.

Furthermore, Lumian's remaining truth serum wouldn't work in this case.
The hypnotized person would only tell what they believed to be true.

Lumian screwed the cap back onto the sedative bottle and thought for a
moment before suggesting, "Let's set up a ritual and seek confirmation
from Mr. Fool. Since Loki can use Celestial Worthy's help to locate
members of the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society within a certain
range, we can employ a similar method to activate the special aura on I
Know Someone. If it's there, he's real. If not, he's fake."

"What if he's a member of the Research Society who was captured by Loki
and I Know Someone? In the past, several people went missing without
their deaths being confirmed, including some Psychiatrists." Franca
began to suspect the source of I Know Someone's Beyonder characteristics
that allowed him to advance to Sequence 7.

*Research Society members they had hunted?*

Lumian pondered for a moment and replied, "In that case, let Jenna in.
She might still have some lingering good luck in this aspect. If she
doesn't encounter anyone else, it proves that the unconscious one is I
Know Someone.

"You're responsible for protecting Jenna..."

Before Lumian could finish, Madam Magician's voice echoed in his ears,
*"There's no need to go through so much trouble."*

Crouching in front of the unconscious person, Lumian sensed the space
around him come alive, contracting inward and swallowing the Beyonder
suspected to be I Know Someone.

"Wow," Franca exclaimed, and Lumian slowly stood up.

The two of them waited patiently. In just 20 to 30 seconds, the Beyonder
in the blue-and-white-striped hospital gown was ejected from the void.

Immediately after, they heard Madam Magician's response: *"It's 'I Know
Someone.'"*

___

Beneath the crimson moon in the sky, the Delta Asylum loomed, its
darkness even denser and curved into an eerie arc compared to the
surrounding night.

On the rooftop of the three-story grayish-blue building, the shadowy
Magician turned to her companion and said, "Apart from the lunatic,
there are no hidden dangers or traps.

"Did I overreact and overestimate the situation?"

Justice, resembling a dream, replied calmly, "There's nothing wrong with
your choice. It's never wrong no matter how much importance you attach
to matters related to that Celestial Worthy.

"Only by paying enough attention each time can we avoid being suddenly
deceived and falling into a true trap."

Magician nodded slightly, closed the notebook in her hand, and cast her
gaze towards the third-floor corridor which wasn't in her line of sight.

___

Upon hearing Madam Magician's conclusion, Lumian let out a chuckle.

He put away the remaining half of the sedative and turned to Franca,
saying, "We can let Jenna in now."

Franca nodded and disappeared into the shadows along the corridor.

Lumian looked down at the seemingly ordinary I Know Someone, his eyes
deep and a sly smile on his lips.

The effects of the Spell of Harrumph should have worn off long ago, but
the Bliss Society's sedative was still doing its job.

Considering I Know Someone's physique, this sedative wouldn't last much
longer. However, Lumian was prepared for this moment.

At that very instant, the Delta Asylum was in chaos due to the fire and
shouting. Particularly on the first floor, the commotion was intense.
The duty doctor and a few burly guards patrolled the area to ensure that
no tinder remnants remained.

Meanwhile, Jenna and Franca skillfully navigated through the shadows and
ascended to the third floor.

Lumian took a sheepskin from Guillaume Bénet, the padre, and spread it
on the ground.

He carefully wrapped I Know Someone in it.

After a brief contemplation, Lumian raised the obsidian arrow in his
hand and plunged it into I Know Someone's left eye.

The excruciating pain jolted I Know Someone awake, and his left eye
turned bloodshot.

Almost simultaneously, he heard a sinister chuckle.

"Sheep!"

Amidst the echoing Hermes words, I Know Someone, cocooned in the ritual
sheepskin, was instantly engulfed by dark light, rendering him
powerless.

When the dark light finally subsided, he had transformed into a
grayish-white sheep.

Lumian withdrew the obsidian arrow from the crushed eyeball and swiftly
plunged it into I Know Someone's right eye.

A blood-curdling scream echoed through the room as Lumian pulled out the
arrow. He pressed down on the struggling "sheep" with one hand and
stroked its head with the other, a sinister smile playing on his lips.

"Now, we can finally have a good chat."

While Lumian engaged in this whispering conversation, he tossed the
obsidian arrow to Jenna.

Next, Lumian produced an ordinary bottle of wound medicine and
meticulously applied it to I Know Someone's blood-colored eye socket. He
wrapped the other party's eyes in layers of white bandages he had
prepared.

Only then did I Know Someone, who had awakened from his coma and was
enduring intense pain, regained some composure. He attempted to use his
abilities, but to no avail.

Franca and Jenna watched Lumian intently as he continued to tend to the
transformed sheep, I Know Someone, feeling a mix of curiosity and
unease. Initially, Jenna had wanted to assist Lumian in extracting
information or exacting revenge, but now, she felt that this scenario
was enough.

She shifted her attention to the obsidian broken arrow in her hand but
noticed no negative effects. She wondered if it was one of the mystical
items Franca had mentioned before.

As Lumian retrieved a brownish-yellow twine he had prepared in advance
and began to wrap it around the sheep's neck, the duty doctor, alerted
by the sheep's bleating, arrived on the third floor with several burly
guards.

Franca and Jenna swiftly concealed themselves in the shadows, while
Lumian, disguised as Aurore, calmly turned and led the sheep to the end
of the corridor.

Crimson flames erupted from Lumian's body, which had regained some of
its spirituality, and blazed fiercely in the corridor.

The duty doctor and the guards dared not approach, witnessing a figure
walking through the flames, heading to the end of the annex corridor.

The figure was also guiding a sheep. It resisted, unwilling to leave,
but the rope around its neck forced it to move forward.

After being dragged on the ground for a while, the sheep, its neck
tightening and its breathing becoming labored, finally stood up and
followed.

By the time the flames in the corridor abruptly extinguished, sparing
any damage to the adjacent rooms, the doctor on duty and the guards had
lost all trace of the man and the sheep.

*Am I hallucinating...* The situation was so odd and
unbelievable that these individuals shared the same thoughts.

Meanwhile, the charred corridor stood as evidence that a fire had indeed
occurred, miraculously without harming anyone.

Leaving a guard to report the incident to the nearest police
headquarters, the duty doctor returned to his office on the first floor
in a bewildered state.

As he sank into his chair, he couldn't help but wonder, *Could it be
that the infernal being associated with fire has emerged from the abyss?
Is its signature to lead a sheep? Is this the embodiment of
flames?*

His thoughts grew more fantastical with each passing moment, and he
couldn't shake the feeling that he should have gone straight to the
cathedral to consult the bishops and padres rather than involve the
police.

*Knock, knock, knock!*

He heard a knock on the door.

The doctor on duty jolted in his chair. He straightened up and responded
with a deep voice, "Come in, please."

As the door creaked open, the doctor's eyes froze.

It was the blond devil, accompanied by the sheep with its eyes wrapped
in white bandages, and its grayish-white face stained with blood.

"I need to trouble you with something," Lumian said calmly as he led I
Know Someone into the doctor's office. "My sheep exhibits severe
anti-human tendencies and extreme violence. I want to treat its mental
illness."

*How...* Before he could formulate a response, the handsome
blond devil inquired, "Do you know how to perform a lobotomy?"

"Yes, a little," the doctor on duty replied subconsciously. "But it's a
sheep..."

*Could the brain structure be the same?*

As he contemplated this, he watched the sheep struggle frantically in
its bindings, unable to escape.

Lumian chuckled.

"It doesn't matter. We can give it a try. It's just a sheep. If it dies,
so be it. We can still roast it."

With that, he dragged the unruly sheep toward a nearby treatment table,
using his hands and feet to pin it down.

If the patient had been human, the doctor, lacking experience and
prohibited from performing a lobotomy, would never have dared to attempt
it. However, because it was a sheep, he had no reservations.

In an effort to avoid antagonizing the arsonist devil and cooperate
while awaiting the arrival of the police, the doctor on duty cautiously
approached the treatment table.

He said hesitantly, "I need an ice pick."

His intention was to create an excuse to go to the ice warehouse and
distance himself from the arsonist devil. However, just as he finished
speaking, a hand emerged from the shadows, offering him a sharp icicle.

*W-what's going on...* In his shock, the doctor vaguely heard
the words, "No need to thank me."

Numbly, he accepted the thin icicle and unwrapped the white bandage
covering the sheep's head.

The sheep's struggle intensified.

Assessing the damage to its eye sockets, the doctor on duty inserted the
thin, sharp icicle through the crack and carefully manipulated it,
stirring its brain's frontal lobe.

After a few moments of struggle, the grayish-white sheep abruptly fell
silent.
