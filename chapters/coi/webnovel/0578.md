## Chapter 578: Marionettes

Amidst the thunderous explosion, the partition separating the two suites
and the one facing the corridor crumbled simultaneously, wreaking havoc
on nearby furniture, the ceiling above, the floor beneath their feet,
and the rooms opposite, swiftly enveloping them in a surging inferno.

Jenna hadn't utilized all the explosives; otherwise, the entire fifth
and fourth floors of Solow Motel would have collapsed in unison.
Nevertheless, a section of the roof gave way, and the floor was strewn
in chaos. The epicenter of the blast unveiled the room below.

As the walls of the adjacent rooms succumbed to the onslaught, the
bricks and wood propelled by the shockwave slammed into Giorgia, causing
her back to buckle, and her head to split open, unleashing a flow of
vivid red blood. Lugano snapped out of his intermittent thoughts and
bodily stiffness, regaining his composure.

Subsequently, he experienced searing pain as the violent shockwave,
mixed with flames and debris, hurled him through the air.

Had it not been for Giorgia shielding him and with his robust Planter's
physique, he likely would have faced severe injuries, teetering on the
brink of death. Limbs could have been severed, or vital points struck.
Despite this, he ended up a battered mess, with a few bones broken,
nearly succumbing to unconsciousness.

Ludwig had sought refuge under the dining table at some point---along
with his food. With the advantage of distance and the makeshift
"shield," he only bore the impact of the collapsed table.

Simultaneously, Jenna and Anthony burst out of the master bedroom
washroom in their suite, their gazes fixed on the adjacent rooms where
walls had crumbled, filling the air with swirling dust.

They vaguely discerned a figure.

The figure, bearing a striking resemblance to Rubió Paco, stood beside
the upturned recliner.

*Loki!* Jenna wasted no time. She condensed a dark, illusory
flame and sent it hurtling towards her target.

Behind her, Anthony Reid's eyes took on a golden tint, pupils dilating.
He was poised to lock onto Loki, ready to unleash Frenzy---a technique
that would plunge Loki into an emotionally and psychologically triggered
state, rendering him incapable of rational thought and effective
response.

Just as Anthony and Jenna prepared to strike, their vision darkened, and
Loki vanished.

They found themselves in a void, no blue sky or white clouds above, no
solid ground below---just darkness embellished with a myriad of stars.

Cosmic Void!

This semi-real, semi-false illusion was a creation achievable by a Child
of the Sea at a certain level.

In the void, Jenna and Anthony beheld a widowed woman in a black bonnet
with subtle wrinkles in front of them.

Martha!

The Paco family's matriarch, now a marionette under Loki's control, was
hidden in the room where Loki manipulated the Spirit Body Threads.

With sufficient preparation time, how could Loki not perform with his
marionettes? He had two puppets with Beyonder powers, and this was one
of them. Another remained concealed, with the last slot reserved for
specific situations, adaptable at will. It could be switched once an
enemy was under control.

When Loki posed as Rubió Paco, bringing Madam Martha to meet the
Governor of the Sea, the family's matriarch was already a marionette.
Thus, he had to ensure she stayed within his control range.

Lugano discerned Madam Martha's severe injuries primarily because a
marionette was essentially comparable to a lifeless entity. A
Marionettist's manipulation of her Spirit Body Threads allowed her to
execute various actions, mimicking living characteristics. To a Sequence
8 Doctor, this appeared as grave injuries.

Had Lumian not infrequently observed others' luck without forming a
habit, he would have realized that Madam Martha's fate was off. It was
eerily still, resembling death.

Martha, a subtle smile on her face, lifted her right hand, a spectral
green light coalescing at her fingertips.

The radiance morphed into a beam that streaked towards Jenna.

Having heard Lumian explain the sea bloodline's abilities, Jenna, at the
sight of the spectral green light, rolled out of the Cosmic Void.
Anthony followed suit. He refrained from using Frenzy on Martha since a
marionette, essentially dead, wouldn't succumb to frenzy.

In the next moment, they both felt a weightiness, plummeting swiftly
through the empty cosmos. They experienced the weightlessness Franca
occasionally mentioned.

In the blink of an eye, Jenna and Anthony landed on the ground and
steadied themselves, yet Martha was nowhere to be seen. The empty cosmos
was shattering inch by inch.

They were still in Solow Motel, but they had descended from the fifth
floor to the fourth.

This was because the mid- to low-level Cosmic Void resembled more of an
illusion. There would be a barrier akin to a wall of spirituality around
them. After falling into it, their bodies remained in reality. As they
rolled and dodged, Martha nudged them forcefully with her formless
power, causing them to plunge into the floor cavity created by the
explosives.

Jenna didn't hesitate. She sprinted up the wall, seized a crack, and
flipped back to the fifth floor where the explosion had occurred.

She saw Lugano tending to his injuries, and Loki and Madam Martha were
absent from the room diagonally opposite.

Ludwig, who had hidden under the dining table, had vanished as well!

On Aquina Street, amid a lively folk celebration, Loki, having
transformed into an inconspicuous passerby, carried Ludwig, who had
"fallen asleep," through the crowd.

His other marionette, a Soul Assurer of the Evernight pathway, stayed
concealed on the opposite side of Lumian's suite, ready to exert
influence on the target.

Initially, Loki had dispatched his temporary marionette, Giorgia, to
handle Lugano. He had manipulated the Doctor's Spirit Body Threads but
refrained from deploying his more potent marionettes. It wasn't due to
fear of alerting Ludwig, but rather a concern that an unseen adversary
might be lurking in the shadows. After all, several lodgers in the motel
hadn't left for the sea prayer ritual celebrations. A couple had
returned before lunchtime next door, almost synchronizing with the
target.

Moreover, a Marionettist's advancement ritual demanded a grand
performance---a splendid and profound drama. Silent, unnoticed
assassinations lacking a sufficient audience failed to meet the
requirements.

Therefore, Loki intentionally singled out Lugano first. If there were no
other foes lurking, it was akin to switching marionettes. If there were,
he could draw them all to him and clandestinely manipulate the target
with the other marionette nearby.

Aware that it was a sealed demigod, Loki knew its strength might be
limited, but its essence remained unchanged. It was impervious to many
influences. However, he believed the Evernight pathway's forced sleep
would still be effective. Since this sealed demigod could experience
exhaustion, hunger, and the need for rest, food, and sleep like a true
child, it implied that the seal had impacted corresponding
characteristics, making him akin to an ordinary person in those aspects.
At most, he would awaken faster and require less rest time.

A few seconds would be ample time for Loki to relocate and conceal
himself with the target before attempting to manipulate the other
party's Spirit Body Threads.

His two marionettes would act independently, confusing both enemies and
the Church of Earth Mother clergyman rushing over. They would lead them
on a chase spanning about 100 to 200 meters, completing the
corresponding performance.

As the time approached, the enemies would pinpoint his hiding spot
through the marionettes' trajectory, joyfully anticipating an encounter.
However, what awaited them would be a demigod-level marionette, leading
to a terrifying and grim outcome.

Under the watchful eyes of the surrounding citizens, the magnificent
play would conclude. Loki could consume the potion and ascend to
Sequence 4, becoming a Bizarro Sorcerer!

___

On the betrothal ship, within Lato Guiaro's Cosmic Void.

This was fundamentally different from lower-middle-level abilities. It
was both an illusory realm and an alternate space that could cause
people to lose themselves and become abnormally fragile. It was akin to
the Bottle of Fiction augmented with hallucinations.

The sticky blob of flesh Lumian had expelled squirmed rapidly,
stretching and expanding into a discernible figure.

Cloaked in blood-red fabric with a matching hood obscuring its face in
shadows, the figure revealed itself as none other than Mr. K of the
Aurora Order.

To counter April Fool's machinations, Lumian had chosen the strategy of
overwhelming force. He accomplished this with overt and imposing power,
complemented by meticulous arrangements.

This plan allowed for a fair margin of error. Even if Lumian made a
miscalculation, as long as April Fool's didn't have Angel-level helpers
or three or more Saints, he could salvage the situation by retaining at
least one or two key members.

To enhance their odds, Franca extended invitations to Hela and Gandalf.
The Fertility Order also notified the higher-ups, ensuring the presence
of a Saint overseeing Port Santa during the sea prayer ritual. The Tarot
Club had two Major Arcana card holders positioned nearby. When April
Fool's key members felt secure, Madam Magician, the Angel of Stars,
would cross a long distance and descend as they prepared to depart!

For extra precaution, Lumian utilized Mr. K's finger to get him to Port
Santa. Morphing with the Rose Bishop's power, he turned into a fleshy
blob, and was concealed in Lumian's stomach to infiltrate the betrothal
ship.

Mr. K glanced up, his eyes taking on an otherworldly illusion, as if
concealing hidden doors.

Swiftly scanning the Cosmic Void, he identified an escape route.

"Follow me," he said to Lumian in a hoarse voice.

Nodding, Lumian reached into the Traveler's Bag, extracting the Flog
boxing gloves and preparing to don them.

*If you guys still have a backup plan or if a few powerhouses don't
appear in time, I'll draw the attention of the evil gods and create
chaos. We'll all face the danger together. Early exits? Forget about
it!*
