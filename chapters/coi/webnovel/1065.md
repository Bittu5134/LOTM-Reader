## Chapter 1065: Forced Entry

As soon as The Hermit card appeared in Cattleya's hand, it seemed to
emit a glossy light.

At the same time, outside the warlock's tower, in the mist shrouding
Avalon's sky, a star began to shine in broad daylight, growing brighter
and brighter until it was dazzling to the eye.

In an instant, a figure emerged from that star.

It was Madam Magician, wearing a deep black warlock's robe embroidered
with twinkling silver stars.

Using the mystical connection provided by The Hermit, she forcibly
located and tore open a gate to Avalon.

After The Hermit Cattleya gained free access to Avalon, The Magician
could actually have broken in using a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact from the
Abraham family. After all, this place was merely created by Torriope
using Mystical Re-enactment, not granted by the Hidden Sage---how could
it stop a high-sequence Door pathway Beyonder who could enter with or
without doors?

But the Moses Ascetic Order was an ancient organization with at least
two Angels and multiple Grade 0 and Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts. At that
time, even with the combined strength of the Tarot Club, the Church of
The Fool, the New City of Silver, and New Moon City, they could at best
fight them to a draw. Moreover, the enemy had the Hidden Sage's
protection while The Fool was not yet awake, so the Major Arcana card
holders didn't act rashly but waited patiently.

Today, the opportunity had come.

Mr. Fool and the other deities were responsible for dealing with the
Hidden Sage---the most difficult part was how to find and lock onto the
target without letting Him escape. Meanwhile, the Tarot Club and
friendly forces were tasked with attacking the Moses Ascetic Order
headquarters to eliminate all the Beyonders who had been deeply
influenced or even corrupted by the Hidden Sage.

Of course, the Tarot Club and the Church of The Fool hadn't deployed all
their High-Sequence Beyonders---they needed to guard against enemy
forces and evil god cults taking advantage of Mr. Fool's personal hunt
to launch surprise attacks on places like the New City of Silver. For
Angels like Suah of the Rose School of Thought, winning wasn't
important; what mattered was whether They could cause damage, which
would shake The Fool's anchors.

*Miss Messenger and Mr. Pallez must remain in the Rorsted
Archipelago...*

*Will and Mr. Azik won't participate in this kind of thing...*

*Only I can take action, but fortunately, allies will provide
help...*

In a flash, numerous thoughts crossed The Magician's mind, finally
converging into one: *But I still have manuscripts to submit...*

Her sigh didn't affect her actions as she stepped to The Hermit's side
in one motion.

The fact that only she had appeared so far didn't mean she was the only
Angel arriving---she was just faster, the first to reach here.

In Madam Magician's eyes, starlight suddenly gathered, seeming to
condense into a book.

Immediately after, a giant sword composed of orange-red twilight light
materialized out of thin air, piercing through the void to strike the
masked dark gold statue.

The Twilight Sword then shattered, transforming into countless
orange-red shards of light that tore apart everything around them,
cutting all objects to pieces, causing them to decay until they
collapsed.

The three dark gold statues were the first to be affected. In the storm
of twilight light, they quickly broke into tiny fragments, each piece
dim and rusty, as if washed by the passage of endless time or having
reached its twilight years.

In the hall, the walls, floor, and ceiling covered in strange cold eyes
dissolved in the orange-red storm, sliding down inch by inch before
shattering.

This void also collapsed.

But Madam Magician had already switched positions, flashing multiple
images of herself, surrounding herself and Ma'am Hermit with layer after
layer of protection.

There were cages bearing a sense of holiness and glory, and darkness
curved into spheres. By the time they shattered, the orange-red
Hurricane of Light had completely subsided.

As the hall atop the warlock's tower collapsed in ruins, another scene
entered The Hermit Cattleya's eyes.

This was a long, deep tunnel leading to an unknown destination. The
tunnel was wide, seemingly composed of connected rooms. In the current
room, more than a dozen High-Sequence Warlocks were busy with their own
tasks.

This space seemed to be a reflection of the warlock's tower, another
side of Avalon, a secret area The Hermit had no way to enter.

It had been forcibly opened by The Magician using the Hurricane of Light
created by the Twilight Sword and the positioning ability of the Grade 0
Sealed Artifact.

Madam Magician didn't delay, dropping a mirror before disappearing from
the spot with Ma'am Hermit, flashing toward the depths of this dark
tunnel.

Before the thrown mirror could hit the ground, Lumian and Jenna, wearing
black warlock robes but with their hoods down, emerged from it.

The warlocks in this room had just awakened from their previous
concentration, all turning their gazes toward them.

Lumian and Jenna also saw what they were doing:

Some were consuming dead infants, some were using infants to make
potions, some were extracting infant fat to apply to objects---various
such activities, all utilizing newborns to complete witchcraft, potions,
or mystical items.

*Wh---* Lumian raised an eyebrow.

Although in folktales, warlocks were often associated with killing
infants and children, and some strange, inhumanly cruel witchcraft
preparations, Lumian knew this wasn't actually mainstream for the
Warlock pathway.

Were there warlocks who did such things, were there similar witchcraft
practices? Of course there were, but definitely not many.

Who would have thought that within the Moses Ascetic Order, which
emphasized morals and precepts, emphasizing the maxim "do as you wish,
but do no harm," there would be so many warlocks doing such things in
Avalon's dark side.

Of course, what surprised Lumian wasn't the Moses Ascetic Order's fall
from grace---that had been confirmed long ago. Otherwise, the Moses
Ascetic Order wouldn't have transformed from a respected society with
good relations with various Churches into an evil, shadowy secret
organization.

What astonished him was how deeply ingrained the practice of utilizing
infant corpses had become in the Moses Ascetic Order---this couldn't
have developed in just a year or two.

And infants inevitably made him think of birth---of mothers.

*Was the Hidden Sage's mutation really related to the Great Mother? Had
this practice started when She brought evil and corruption to the Moses
Ascetic Order? Utilizing birth and death? *Lumian tilted his
head, looking at Jenna, whose expression changed from shock to anger,
and quickly said, "This place is yours."

He then flashed toward the depths of the wide, dark tunnel.

His mission wasn't here.

The reason Jenna participated in this operation was because Lumian
believed the role of a Demoness of Despair could also be fulfilled
through combat, through killing, through destruction.

A Demoness who brought despair!

Jenna wouldn't participate in the battles deep within Avalon, mainly
focusing on clearing out the corrupt low and mid-sequence warlocks,
bringing them despair. In this process, if she encountered a Saint, or
even two or three Saints, with a Demoness of Despair's survival
abilities, she might not win, but death was unlikely.

The warlocks in the current room had already realized enemies had
invaded, some preparing to cast spells, some taking advantage of their
materials, some trying to bring out their mystical items---none
retreated.

*What excellent materials!*

*What excellent materials!*

Their eyes burned with madness and greed as they looked at Jenna.

The angry Jenna suddenly smiled, as if light had entered this somewhat
dark world.

All those warlocks of different sequences were stunned for a moment,
unable to carry out their intended actions in time.

Almost simultaneously, they felt the cold.

A layer of frost formed on the surface of their bodies, their hair, and
the tables themselves where infant corpses and various materials were
laid out.

They began to shiver, their joints stiffening, their movements becoming
obviously labored and difficult.

Then, one crystalline ice spear after another shot out from in front of
Jenna, accurately piercing each wrlock's body, pinning them to the walls
or floor, their blood seeping out and freezing.

The warlocks tried to resist, but not only were their bodies frozen,
they were also bound and affected by invisible spider silk, making it
difficult to take effective action.

Jenna didn't kill them immediately, letting the mystical plague spread
simultaneously with her Charm freely erode these fallen ones, making
them clearly feel their lungs tightening, their heads burning, and their
life slipping away.

They began to despair.

The Magician pursued in a wandering manner, leaving even The Hermit
behind.

Finally, ignoring other enemies along the way, she reached a desolate,
boundless plain.

Torriope, wearing a black hood and warlock's robe, seemed to be in the
depths of the wilderness.

He gazed into the distance at Madam Magician and raised His right palm.

An illusory figure was quickly sketched in the endless wilderness.

This was a spell derived from Mystical Re-enactment.

As an Angel who advanced in the middle to late Fourth Epoch, although
Torriope wasn't a founding member who established the Moses Ascetic
Order, he had lived for over a thousand years, witnessed many mystical
events, mastered much mystical knowledge, and through this created
several powerful spells.

With the core ability of Mystical Re-enactment, Beyonders of the Mystery
Pryer pathway could indeed potentially live longer and grow stronger.

However, because too many people knew about major events like the War of
the Four Emperors and the Pale Disaster, Torriope couldn't draw power
from them to create spells that would be considered terrifying even at
the Angel level, and could only choose second-rate ones.

As soon as that illusory figure in the wilderness solidified, bloody
chunks of flesh began falling continuously from its body.

Each piece of bloody flesh turned into a cold, emotionless eye, and they
quickly looked toward Madam Magician, emanating an aura of chaos,
madness, and evil.

This was a spell Torriope created from the strange death of one of the
Moses Ascetic Order's founders: "Loss of Control Gaze"!
