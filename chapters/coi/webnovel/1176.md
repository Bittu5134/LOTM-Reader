## Chapter 1176: A Temporary Retreat

Lumian did not pursue Primordial Hunger, just as he had refrained
earlier from borrowing the other three powers from Eternal Darkness
Amanises to try to kill Primordial Hunger in one strike. Such an action
would have triggered the opponent's survival instincts, helping Him
overcome His fear of "Father" and mount a strong resistance, thus
exposing the deception.

Reaching this point was sufficient. By the time Primordial Hunger, a
Great Old Dominator that relied primarily on instincts, figured out what
had just happened and realized the falsity of "Father," hours or even
days would have passed before He returned---still bearing severe
injuries.

Lumian's decision was to immediately rendezvous with Eternal Darkness
Amanises. Together, they would confront the already gravely injured
Inextinguishable Ravings, aiming to either eliminate Him within ten
seconds or inflict wounds so severe that He would no longer dare to
return.

At that moment, the Lord of Mysteries Klein imposed the symbolism of
Foolishness on the newly materialized body of the Mother Goddess of
Depravity.

However, every part of the Mother Goddess of Depravity was in a state of
constant New Life, including Her soul, consciousness, spirit, and
intellect.

This caused Her to recover Her intellect as soon as She became Foolish,
rendering Her immune to the core symbolism of the Lord of Mysteries.

For now, Lumian had no intention of joining the battle between the
Pillars. He quickly arrived at the battlefield where Eternal Darkness
Amanises and Inextinguishable Ravings were engaged.

The formless Inextinguishable Ravings abruptly vanished, no longer
resonating within their minds or affecting their consciousness and
spirits.

He had fled the battle to observe from another star dominion, awaiting
an opportunity to return. Gravely injured, He chose to follow His
survival instincts, avoiding the battlefield where two Great Old
Dominators capable of combining into the Fourth Pillar's power were
present.

With the distraction of Inextinguishable Ravings gone, the
High-Dimensional Overseer did not linger either. He ascended to the
highest dimension, taking advantage of the Celestial Master and
Celestial Thearch's projection having a minimal influence on this
domain, and quickly fled the battlefield to hide.

He covertly observed the area, waiting to see if another opportunity
might arise.

At this point, Origins of Disaster Lumian and Eternal Darkness Amanises
were without opponents.

Their gazes simultaneously turned toward the Mother Goddess of
Depravity, whose form was adorned with clouds of swirling crimson
moonlight and drifting ash, serving as Her celestial attire.

They prepared to join the battle between the Pillars.

However, they were acutely aware that if the two of them engaged in a
fierce fight with the Mother Goddess of Depravity, Inextinguishable
Ravings and the High-Dimensional Overseer would inevitably return to
this star dominion. Moreover, the Mother Goddess of Depravity would
swiftly heal Inextinguishable Ravings, allowing Him to fully unleash His
symbolism, which countered collective consciousness and spirits. This
could delay them until the Goddess of Fate emerged from the labyrinth,
escaped the spirit world, and broke free of Foolishness.

Although the situation had improved compared to before, the crisis was
far from over. Additionally, Lumian and Eternal Darkness Amanises needed
to remain vigilant over the slumbering Grisha Adam. If anything went
awry there, they would have to join forces immediately to kill the
Primordial God Almighty before His revival could be completed.

At this moment, they saw Lord of Mysteries Klein take a deliberate step
back. His thoughts reverberated through the spirit world, spreading
across the star dominion. "Does your contract with the Primordial God
Almighty have a deadline for fulfillment?"

Origins of Disaster Lumian and Eternal Darkness Amanises exchanged
glances and chose to trust Mr. Fool's judgment. They did not return to
that battlefield but maintained their vigilance.

Despite their precarious advantage, Mr. Fool's sudden decision to
negotiate with the Mother Goddess of Depravity indicated that something
problematic was happening in the background!

The Mother Goddess of Depravity stared at Klein for a second before
manifesting the various concepts, authorities, and symbolisms comprising
the contract in the astral world.

Lord of Mysteries Klein glanced at it, finding the contract drafted by
the Primordial God Almighty to be exceptionally tight, leaving no
exploitable loopholes.

Smiling, he raised his star-encrusted cane and Replicated the Distortion
power originating from the Black Emperor pathway.

A clause in the contract immediately twisted, though it did not yet form
a usable loophole.

Almost simultaneously, Klein extended his left hand, gloved in black.

Deceit symbolism!

Under the dual effects, the clause in the contract finally changed: "The
time limit is until the conclusion of this event."

Klein immediately smiled and addressed the Mother Goddess of Depravity,
"Why not wait until your period of weakness ends---until you can wield
the unique symbolism of the Chaos Primogenitor---before fulfilling the
agreement?

"After all, you haven't yet reclaimed the Uniqueness of the Mother and
Moon pathways, nor achieved all your objectives. This means that the
current event isn't over; it's merely reached halftime.

"There's no rule stating that a single event can't last two or three
millennia."

These words, exchanged via telepathic communication, were delivered in
an instant.

The Mother Goddess of Depravity's flawlessly beautiful head turned
toward the High-Dimensional Overseer and the Goddess of Fate, who was
still ten seconds away from leaving the spirit world. She casually
healed Inextinguishable Ravings.

These were the Great Old Dominators who could rejoin the battle within
two minutes.

Next, the Mother Goddess of Depravity shifted Her gaze to Origins of
Disaster Lumian, Eternal Darkness Amanises, Celestial Master and
Celestial Thearch's projection, and the newly awakened golden Buddha.

Finally, Her eyes landed on the face of Lord of Mysteries Klein,
scrutinizing him for a moment.

"Three more seconds before we continue fighting." Klein's consciousness
transmitted.

After assessing the situation and determining that the chances of
victory were slim, the Mother Goddess of Depravity finally made Her
decision. Nodding lightly to Lord of Mysteries Klein, She said, "Okay."

The weakened Pillar wasted no further time. She once again transformed
into a crimson moon and vanished into the astral world.

Seeing their Mother leave, the High-Dimensional Overseer and
Inextinguishable Ravings also abandoned the fight, retreating rapidly
from the star dominion.

On the planet at the edge of the universe, Franca and the others were
astonished to see the Outer Deities' followers retreat like a receding
tide, hurriedly leaving behind numerous corpses.

"Is it over?" Unburdened by the sudden loss of pressure, They felt
momentarily bewildered.

Red Angel Medici sensed the information filtering through the spirit
world. Turning around, He smiled and confirmed, "It's over."

Hearing these words, The Star Leonard and the others visibly relaxed. It
was as if the sun shone down on Them, and a breeze carrying the scent of
grass gently caressed Their faces.

Within the battlefield of the Great Old Ones.

Seeing Lord of Mysteries Klein return, Eternal Darkness Amanises tacitly
shrouded the star dominion in deeper darkness, concealing all
information to prevent any leaks.

Klein gazed at the shrinking figure of the Celestial Master, the
increasingly shadowy projections behind the Celestial Thearch, and the
golden Buddha slowly reverting to the Buddhist Kingdom of Light, He
sighed and said, "They could only temporarily exhibit power approaching
that of the Great Old Ones. I tried to make 'temporary' last longer, but
it's still close to ending.

"More importantly, once the fighting becomes intense, the Mother Goddess
of Depravity will realize that I'm as weak as She is."

This was the cost of forcing both the Supernova Dominator and the
Goddess of Fate out of the battle in the shortest time possible.

Lumian immediately understood why Mr. Fool had opted to negotiate with
the Mother Goddess of Depravity despite having the upper hand. He had
helped Her avoid the constraints of the contract.

Given the current situation, if the battle continued, Mr. Fool would be
tied up holding off the Mother Goddess of Depravity and unable to
intervene elsewhere. The Celestial Master, Celestial Thearch's
projection, and the Key of Light would soon exit the battle. Lumian and
Eternal Darkness Amanises would then have to face both the
High-Dimensional Overseer and the healed Inextinguishable Ravings. Even
as a team, they wouldn't be able to force either out of the fight within
seconds. By then, the Goddess of Fate would return.

"So, you Deceived the Mother Goddess of Depravity to make Her overlook
your and the Celestial Master and company's states?" Eternal Darkness
Amanises understood Klein's choice but didn't grasp why the Mother
Goddess of Depravity had agreed.

Lord of Mysteries Klein shook his head. "She only overlooked my state
and was fully aware of the Celestial Master and company's condition.

"She agreed mainly because She's in a weakened state and fears suffering
another loss against me. Meanwhile, the Celestial Master and company's
problems wouldn't directly translate into Her ultimate victory. From Her
perspective, She knows we still have other measures."

Hearing this, Eternal Darkness Amanises and Origins of Disaster Lumian
both turned to the increasingly unstable projection of the Celestial
Thearch.

Indeed, there was still another way.

That was to abandon the Nation of Disorder, letting the High-Dimensional
Overseer take and accommodate it. Then, they would unseal Genie from the
Magic Wishing Lamp, releasing Him to return to the Nation of Disorder
and engage the High-Dimensional Overseer in a battle of consciousness.

In doing so, the High-Dimensional Overseer---no true ally of the other
Great Old Ones---would certainly withdraw from the battle and hide in
the most secretive location, quietly contending with Genie. Lumian and
Amanises would only need to deal with the Goddess of Fate and
Inextinguishable Ravings, with a good chance of forcing one of Them out
within two minutes.

At that point, even if Supernova Dominator broke free from His seal, the
situation would only return to a balanced state.

The problem with this approach was the loss of the Nation of Disorder.
They would later have to find the victorious High-Dimensional Overseer
or Genie to negotiate terms, ensuring They wouldn't hinder Roselle's
resurrection.

For Klein, Lumian, and the others, this was a last-resort strategy, but
the Mother Goddess of Depravity, a born Great Old Dominator, would see
it as an inevitable move.

Given the lack of hope for victory and the chance to avoid the
contract's constraints, the weakened Mother Goddess naturally agreed to
a "temporary" truce.

Amanises cast Her gaze toward the still-slumbering Grisha Adam. "There's
still one problem.

"Even in His slumber, it's no longer possible to stop the Primordial God
Almighty's consciousness from gaining dominance."

Klein and Grisha Adam had tacitly agreed on how to handle such a
situation. With a solemn expression, he signaled Eternal Darkness
Amanises to lift the slumber imposed on Grisha Adam.

"I'll do it," Lumian volunteered.

Klein glanced at him, then nodded, saying, "Wait a moment."

He then teleported all the participants back to the original star
dominion.

Standing amidst the vast emptiness of the infinite darkness, Klein's
thoughts naturally drifted to the days he had wandered the continent as
Merlin, restoring houses and cities one by one.

He removed his silk half top hat, placed it over his chest, and bowed
slightly as he said,

"My wish is:

"For this star dominion to be restored to its state at the end of the
previous epoch."

Accompanied by his words, the materials left behind by the Supernova
Dominator converged rapidly with the scenes from the fog of history.

Boom!

Dense matter ignited, becoming a blazing star---becoming a sun.

Planets took shape one after another, and beneath Lumian and Amanises
lay a green-and-blue orb of exceptional beauty.

Next, Klein made another wish, "My wish is:

"For Earth to be restored to its state before the descent of the Mother
Goddess of Depravity."

One by one, buildings rose swiftly from the ground of the beautiful blue
planet. Cities like Backlund, Trier, and Shanghai were rapidly rebuilt.
Farmland was reclaimed, and the oceans brimmed with life once more.

Having completed this task, Lord of Mysteries Klein teleported the
protection zones and Angels from the planet at the edge of the universe
back to their original locations, lifting the barrier and restoring all
beings to their rightful places.

Across the land, the sounds of human voices erupted in joyous
celebration.
