## Chapter 1167: Inextinguishable Ravings

As the pitch-black fiend fully materialized, a terrifying raving echoed
from deep within, as if originating from the very source of existence.

This awakened madness within the sefirah itself caused all negative
emotions and rampant desires to explode uncontrollably. Whether it was
the Master of the Shadow Cottage's head or Farbauti's, both instantly
lost Their ability to think, Their vision filled with twisted crimson
and flickering black shadows.

Simultaneously, this terrifying raving resonated equally from the
sefirah, Uniqueness, and Beyonder characteristics of every living being
within the star dominion.

The Celestial Master froze in the void, while the decayed figures
gathered within the Knowledge Moor simultaneously raised their heads and
let out pained howls.

Behind the Celestial Thearch's projection, similar figures with veiled
faces emerged one after another, their hair and beards bristling in
agitation.

The illusory golden Buddha trembled as if on the verge of shattering.

The Philosophical Essence, the Inextinguishable Ravings, the Symbolism
of Life's Spirit, and the Eternal Consciousness!

The raving primarily awakened the spiritual imprint of the Original
Creator, which resided within all sefirot, Uniqueness, and Beyonder
characteristics. No one could escape it; no one could remain unaffected!

However, compared to those sefirot, Uniqueness, and Beyonder
characteristics directly derived from the Original Creator, the
Tenebrous World was much less affected in this regard. This was because
it had been torn from the Mother Tree of Desire, rather than a product
split from the Original Creator.

Even so, the Abyss and the Chained pathways---heavily laden with desires
and malice---were highly volatile. The Master of the Shadow Cottage and
Farbauti, lacking the critical Uniquenesses, were already the weakest
among the four quasi-Old Ones. As a result, the pitch-black fiend nearly
disintegrated and lost control, becoming utterly powerless for a moment.

Compared to the Tenebrous World, Great Old Dominators like the
High-Dimensional Overseer and the Monarch of Decay were less impacted by
the terrifying raving, barely able to endure it.

This was because They were not direct descendants of the Original
Creator's three children but offspring of the union between the Original
Creator and the Mother Goddess of Depravity. With an intermediary layer,
the spiritual imprint of the Original Creator within the sefirot,
Uniqueness, and Beyonder characteristics was relatively weak.

For Them, this was an opportunity!

Fortunately, after a brief moment of chaos, the Celestial Master and the
Celestial Thearch's projection began to unleash Their powers wildly and
irrationally upon the outside world. One flooded the region with an
ocean of knowledge, while the other distorted all surrounding concepts,
authorities, and symbolisms.

When the effects of the Inextinguishable Ravings subsided, the Master of
the Shadow Cottage and Farbauti were astonished to find Themselves still
alive, with Their other allies similarly unscathed.

Neither the High-Dimensional Overseer nor Inextinguishable Ravings had
managed to seize the opportunity or achieve Their objectives.

As long as the Key of Light existed and retained a measure of
consciousness without succumbing to madness, He would naturally bring
good fortune to Himself and His companions.

He was the symbolism of fate!

†

The influence of Inextinguishable Ravings extended across this star
dominion. Even Eternal Darkness Amanises was not spared, feeling a
madness from the source that seemed to want to seize Her consciousness
and claim Her body.

Amanises immediately put Herself into a state of slumber, letting Her
thoughts, spirit, and even the madness within Her sefirot fall into
stillness to escape the influence.

The Monarch of Decay, understanding what was happening, seized the
opportunity to release a vast and overwhelming suction force from His
golden-plated body.

This was the power of Beyonder characteristic convergence from His
sefirot!

The force could pull every being within the star dominion toward Him!

The Monarch of Decay indiscriminately activated this convergence,
unwilling to waste time allowing the Fog of War to decay and die
naturally. Both Eternal Darkness and Origins of Disaster were closer to
Him than other Great Old Dominators or sefirot and would reach Him
first.

The still-slumbering Amanises passed through the Fog of War and was
instantly drawn to the front of the Monarch of Decay.

The Monarch of Decay immediately stopped the convergence, preventing
other Great Old Dominators or sefirot from interfering with His upcoming
attempt.

He extended His massive, rotting left hand, yellow-green and veined with
blue, pressing it toward Eternal Darkness Amanises from a distance.

Sure hit, certain death!

But as the Monarch of Decay reached out His hand, Eternal Darkness
Amanises transformed into Origins of Disaster Lumian.

The moment Lumian sensed the effects of the convergence, he realized the
Monarch of Decay's intent. Using the authority subordinate to the
essence of war, he swapped positions with Amanises.

They were a team, and their positions could be exchanged at any time!

Now, it was Lumian who faced the rotting left hand.

Like the Outer Deities, Lumian was barely affected by the
Inextinguishable Ravings. This wasn't because the spiritual imprint of
the Original Creator within his sefirot, Uniqueness, and Beyonder
characteristics hadn't been awakened. On the contrary, as one of the
Calamity pathways prepared for the Original Creator's resurrection, the
madness within him was the most intense. However, the incomplete
mirrored Original Creator symbolism within him had corresponding
masculine and feminine consciousnesses that were actually strengthened
under the influence of the ravings.

This enhanced consciousness and symbolism of the mirrored Original
Creator controlled the awakened spiritual imprint, allowing Lumian to
retain his ability to think and fight, though it significantly shortened
the fragile balance within him.

Facing the inevitable strike imbued with certain death, Lumian's main
head and the face of Aurore both turned to look at the Monarch of Decay.

His other head rotated as well, alternating between the faces of Alista
Tudor and Cheek. Their gazes reflected the Monarch of Decay's form into
a deep mirror world, where celestial bodies rapidly began to form around
Him.

Under the lingering effects of the terrifying ravings, the sefirot,
Uniqueness, and Beyonder characteristics of the Monarch of Decay
suddenly erupted into an indescribably horrifying spiritual storm.

This came from the spiritual imprint of the Original Creator.

Normally, the Monarch of Decay could endure the resulting tremors and
influence, as His spiritual imprint of the Original Creator was not
strong due to being a child of the Original Creator and the Mother
Goddess of Depravity.

But this was not a normal situation. Lumian forcibly activated the
incomplete mirrored Original Creator symbolism, further amplifying the
spiritual imprint within the Monarch of Decay. And then, disaster
struck.

Origins of Disaster!

Lumian simultaneously utilized this symbolism!

The Monarch of Decay, swept up entirely by the spiritual storm, fell
into chaos. His outstretched left hand froze, torn between continuing
the attack and retreating to end His own life, aiding the triumph of the
madness within.

Seeing this, Lumian smiled and shared the powers of the now-awakened
Eternal Darkness Amanises, striking the Monarch of Decay with a
dusk-orange greatsword of bound destruction, a vortex of chaos, a
decelerating blade of twilight, and a deathly blackness of pallor and
tranquility.

These forces both repelled each other and exhibited strange fusion.

As the horrifying transformation was about to occur, all of Lumian and
Amanises' abnormalities vanished, and the dense white mist before them
dissipated.

This region reverted to the moment before Lumian created the Fog of War,
before the Monarch of Decay fell into madness and chaos.

Circle Inhabitant!

†

A shadowy vortex, rimmed with sharp teeth, did not linger near Lumian
but instead raced toward the enormous luminous figure upheld by the
Chaos Sea.

He was heading to devour Grisha Adam!

This was a Deceit from the Lord of Mysteries Klein.

Against Primordial Hunger, the symbolism of Foolishness had little
effect, but Deceit did. Klein exploited Primordial Hunger's instinct for
convergence and desired target, forcibly guiding Him to seek the Chaos
Sea He could merely control rather than the City of Calamity He could
accommodate.

This gave Grisha Adam, who had achieved temporary balance, time to hold
off Primordial Hunger, while other Great Old Dominators would likely
target weaker sefirot, avoiding the truly great existences. This, paired
with the birth of Eternal Darkness, allowed the Knowledge Moor and the
other three sefirot to hold off three Great Old Dominators, giving
Origins of Disaster Lumian a chance to face the Monarch of Decay
one-on-one.

This was the intended plan, though inevitable developments and
unexpected variables arose. Now, however, something had changed: The
Circle of Inevitability had begun aiding the Monarch of Decay, forcing
Amanises to remain and join Lumian, leaving the four sefirot to fend off
two Great Old Dominators on Their own.

Crack, crack. Primordial Hunger continued devouring the luminous figure
and chaos before Him, only to grow hungrier the more He ate.

It was all fake, all mere envisioned illusions!

Suddenly, the Chaos Sea quaked, and Grisha Adam's enormous luminous
figure wavered, sinking halfway into the depths.

Inextinguishable Ravings!

The attack, which awakened the spiritual imprint of the Original
Creator, had an extraordinary effect on Grisha Adam, inheritor of the
Primordial God Almighty's titles of Creator and the Omniscient and
Omnipotent One.

The madness that erupted within the luminous figure rivaled that of
Lumian, who accommodated the City of Calamity, but without the relevant
Original Creator symbolisms to suppress it, Grisha Adam fell into chaos.

Primordial Hunger did not seize the opportunity to devour Him but
instead paused and began consuming the voices echoing within His own
mind.

They tasted rather good.

Amid the undulating Chaos Sea, Amon, donning a pointed soft hat and
classical black robe, leaned against a massive cross, tossing a crimson
sphere seemingly composed of the concept of beauty, filled with
countless shadows of people, and catching it again.

Glancing at the battle outside the Chaos Sea, Amon clicked His tongue
and chuckled to Himself.

"Why am I here?

"I should be causing mischief outside the protected zones.

"Unexpectedly, I can still participate in battles of this caliber."
