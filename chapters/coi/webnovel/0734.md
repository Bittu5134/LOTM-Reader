## Chapter 734: My Weapon

Lumian stood at the quarry cave's exit, wanting to work with Mr. K to
take on Perle, but unsure of how to proceed.

Past experience had shown him that without godhood, any action against
an Overseer would only come back to haunt him, without affecting the
demigod at all.

With his golden mask removed, Lumian could only remain in place,
considering what items he possessed that might be useful and effective.
He was left with no option but to watch the fight between Mr. K and
Perle unfold as a mere spectator.

At the same time, he scanned the area, looking for a way to utterly
destroy the existing mirror world.

Anthony kept his posture and continued drawing on the blank painting
album, which was missing a page.

His current subject was to be Madam Magician.

As he observed Mr. K's movements and listened to each slash, Lumian
sensed a slight corruption creeping into his mind.

It surprised him that Mr. K could hold the Overseer at bay to some
degree, unafraid of her accusations and armed with a means to harm her.

Lumian silently hoped that even if Mr. K couldn't defeat Perle, he would
at least be able to drive her off.

Mustering strength from his waist and core, Mr. K swung his upper body
as he descended, bringing the dark broadsword down on Overseer Perle's
head for the third time.

Perle remained motionless, not using any Mirror Traversal-like ability
to evade, nor rolling to the side. She stood firm beside the jutting
rock, her body turning pitch-black and dissolving into a constantly
dissipating shadow.

The dark, enigmatic broadsword plunged down abruptly, silently cleaving
the shadows in two.

The shadows rapidly encircled the protruding rock, perpetually moving
and merging once again. They writhed, striving to reassemble Overseer
Perle's form.

Where the Sword of Darkness had cut through, the shadows struggled to
form proper connections, barely managing to stack together into a
humanoid shape riddled with cracks and misaligned parts.

Mr. K sprang up, ready to swing the dark broadsword gripped in the
gaping crack of his mouth.

Suddenly, his body shrank rapidly, the cold black armor encasing him
vanishing.

He reverted to his original form, dressed in a black hood and matching
robe.

The precariously assembled shadow gradually shed its black color,
revealing human skin and a vivid red dress inch by inch.

In the shadowy cathedral at an undisclosed location, the mercury giant
serpent phantom hanging in midair slowly faded away.

The Reboot was finished.

Perched on a black wooden armchair, Loki abruptly thinned and shrank,
transforming into a paper figurine.

The paper figurine and chair then crumbled, disintegrating into dust.

Loki materialized in a far corner of the cathedral. Magician, appearing
to still be airborne, quickly conjured an alternate self behind him.

As Loki reached into the void to pull out an assistant, his jet-black
eyes suddenly shifted to blue.

The blue rapidly stained black, then reverted to blue, the two colors
continually alternating.

Loki was paralyzed, unable to summon an aide, allowing Magician to
stretch out her right hand and grasp with all her might.

The dark void warped, swallowing Loki. Then, the two shattered into
fragments, ultimately buried in a bottomless abyss.

Throughout this, Loki's body instantly became ethereal, unreal, as if he
were a projection or puppet that had been swapped at some moment.

Hermit, Judgment, and Magician simultaneously heard a regretful sigh and
witnessed the shadowy cathedral itself turn ethereal and slowly
disintegrate.

It, too, seemed to be a projection.

An aged, ethereal voice then echoed from the distance.

"My wish is for all the demigods present to be lost for three minutes."

The shadowy cathedral fully collapsed, and darkness engulfed the
surroundings, devoid of starlight or boundaries.

In the special mirror world, realizing Mr. K could no longer maintain
his godhood-enhanced half-giant state and Overseer Perle was close to
returning to her human form, Lumian's first instinct was to shape-shift
into a shadow being and flee through the growing rift in the mirror
world to find other allies.

However, he was unsure if Mr. K had employed any mystical items upon
entry, and whether Shadow Transformation alone would allow passage
through the mirror world's fissure.

As Lumian watched Overseer Perle's face gradually come into view, her
eyes and nostrils both vertically misaligned, a sudden realization
struck him.

*I, too, can wound an Overseer...*

*If Mr. K can do it, so can I!*

*My fate is intertwined with Termiboros. To a degree, we can be
considered one. I've long known I possess a fake angelic level!*

*The powers and items I wield won't hold godhood and can't touch an
Overseer, but I should be able to do it myself.*

*I will become my own weapon!*

These thoughts raced through Lumian's mind as a slightly manic grin
spread across his face. His blood seemed to boil, as if set aflame.

In a flash, he disappeared and reappeared before Overseer Perle.

His eyes had already taken on an iron-black tint, revealing a few pale
spots that marked Perle's vulnerabilities.

One such spot was just below the left side of her face!

Before Perle's shadows could fully reconstruct the Overseer, a multitude
of incandescent white flames burst forth from Lumian's body.

Like a rushing current, they poured out from Lumian's eyes, ears,
nostrils, mouth, skin, and pores, completely enveloping him,
transforming him into a raging inferno.

*Let's do this!*

*Let us burn as one!*

*Let us explode together!*

Lumian, now one with the blazing white flames, swung his right fist at
Perle's left cheek.

Perle's vertically-misaligned eyes betrayed a flicker of confusion
before understanding dawned.

But it was too late for her to protest or react. She had not even fully
returned.

*Bang!*

Lumian's right fist collided with Perle's left cheek, caving it in.

As he struck, a ghastly wound appeared on his own chest and abdomen, but
it was quickly consumed by the blazing white flames.

Perle felt the pain, but it was not a mortal blow.

At that instant, Lumian's face, wreathed in blazing white flames,
displayed a sinister and frenzied smile.

*It actually works!*

*I can truly use myself as a weapon to strike an Overseer!*

*Boom!*

He detonated his right arm, using the incandescent white flames he had
pre-injected to make it explode.

His right fist, propelled by a fierce, blazing white wave of flames,
pierced Perle's left cheek and penetrated her skull.

Cull!

*Crack!* The special mirror world, with its dark barrier and
numerous cracks, let out a shattering sound. It rapidly disintegrated
and fell apart.

Lumian's head took an invisible blow, his skull caving in and teeth
falling out.

Deprived of his right arm, he was hurled through the air, his entire
body wreathed in blazing white flames.

His face twisted in agony, yet his eyes shone with elation.

*Success!*

He beheld a horrific, blood-red wound on the left side of Overseer
Perle's face. Within the wound, a pale-white fog intermingled with the
grayish-white brain. The shattered fist had ripped it asunder and set it
ablaze.

As the blazing white flames faded, Overseer Perle's remaining right eye
dulled, and her body slowly crumpled.

The cage imprisoning Franca and Jenna quickly disintegrated.

Mr. K, observing this, nodded approvingly.

*Lumian is like me!*

*The fighting style is quite alike!*

*The only shortcoming is that he did not loudly praise the Lord during
the final blow.*

At the same time, Lumian's head buzzed, and he nearly blacked out. He
collapsed to the ground, on the verge of losing consciousness.

He managed to stay awake only because he had undergone significant
digestion of the Reaper potion. It felt as if he had completed another
massive cull by the ancient tomb during the Dream Festival.

*Wh---* Lumian was initially thrilled, but then he forced
himself to stand, shocked and suspicious.

He knew the digestion must have resulted from his Culling of Overseer
Perle, but shouldn't a demigod suffice for him to fully digest the
Reaper potion?

Lumian extinguished the incandescent white flames burning within and
without. With his left hand, he retrieved the healing agent and Lie
earring obtained from Jebus from his Traveler's Bag, all while examining
Overseer Perle's corpse.

Just then, the special mirror world completely collapsed, and they found
themselves back in reality, inside the quarry cave with a fixed mirror
world entrance.

Next to the protruding rock where Perle had stood, there was no corpse
or white fog to be seen.

Lumian spotted an oil painting hanging on the corresponding rock wall.

The painting looked torn and ruined, but one could faintly discern that
it had once portrayed a woman in a red dress.

*Perle?*

*We weren't facing the true Overseer, but a painted figure she created
using a Pixie pathway item?*

*This oil painting grants the depicted demigod a short lifespan, but no
freedom of movement?*

*Is that why Perle never budged and always took the attacks
head-on?*

Amid his bewilderment, Lumian drank the healing agent Jebus had procured
from the Great Mother's followers to ensure he would survive past 6 a.m.

At that moment, Perle's smiling voice resonated from the depths of the
shattered oil painting.

"I didn't anticipate my painting person failing.

"But no matter. What's important is that the vortex is about to
manifest. It won't be long before you're officially consumed.

"Everyone will be caught up in it..."

Perle's voice gradually faded into the depths of the oil painting,
thwarting Mr. K's attempt to track her through teleportation.
