## Chapter 821: Infatuation

Above the dark and low void of the mirror world, numerous brilliant
stars shed beams of clear light.

These beams converged into a column of light, illuminating the mirror
world and engulfing Franca, the Demoness webs, and Nikila himself.

Franca and Nikila both shattered into countless mirror fragments. These
shards, along with the invisible webs, quickly dissolved into nothing
under the starlight.

The starlight quickly faded, and Nikila and Franca's figures reappeared
in different corners of the mirror world.

Seeing the entrance to the tunnel of webs now unobstructed, Nikila felt
a surge of joy. He pulled out a dark gray scroll from the inner pocket
of his black wool coat.

Suppressing the urge to cough, he whispered a Hermes word, "Wind!"

The dark gray scroll instantly ignited with cyan flames, a roaring wind
gathering around Nikila, pushing his feverish and muddled thoughts
forward at the speed of the wind toward one of the dark tunnels.

Nikila, seizing the moment before Franca could intervene, followed the
wind into the tunnel entrance.

However, he didn't feel the familiar pull from other mirrors.

He was back where he started.

The dark, illusory tunnel wasn't open to him!

Mirror Maze!

After becoming a Demoness of Affliction, Franca's mirror magic had
evolved, allowing her to create scene illusions with pre-set mirrors.

While waiting for Jenna and Anthony to act, she had woven invisible
webs, spread pathogens, and placed mirrors at multiple tunnel entrances.

These mirrors, influenced by Beyonder powers, reflected each other,
creating a mirror maze that hid the real tunnel entrances, showing only
their reflections.

Nikila had chosen a false target, the reflection of a real tunnel, and
naturally couldn't escape.

Taking advantage of this gap, Franca wove another web, ensnaring Nikila,
wrapping him in layers, either making him blush or laugh uncontrollably.

Having experienced this before, Nikila didn't let himself get completely
entangled. Using his abilities as a Constellations Master, he broke free
once again.

In the following time, amidst increasing fever and violent coughing, he
barely managed to fend off Franca using scrolls and attempted to destroy
the mirrors creating the maze, seeking the real exit.

Under Warlock attacks and interference from spells like wind blades,
lightning, flashes, purification, freezing, and paralysis, Franca kept
changing positions, sometimes using Mirror Substitution to block an
attack, showing great patience and restraint.

Her focus was on maintaining the Demoness webs and spreading pathogens,
using her Demoness of Affliction's Charm to buy time.

Gradually, Nikila felt he shouldn't resist or harm the beautiful lady.

His breath grew hot, his heart racing either from the pathogens or her
every move, pounding as if to leap from his chest.

The immense pressure made him suspect he might suffer a heart attack any
second.

Without hesitation, he pulled out a scroll etched with lightning
patterns from his coat's inner pocket.

It was a powerful item he bought from a Broker.

"Storm!" Just as he finished chanting, Nikila started coughing
violently, and the scroll erupted into a dazzling silver light.

The silver light expanded, filling the mirror world with a thunderstorm,
the accompanying wind pushing lightning into the tunnel entrances,
shattering the mirrors Franca had placed.

With the sound of breaking glass, Franca's figure shattered, the mirror
maze collapsed, revealing the true dark tunnels.

Nikila had no time to celebrate. Aided by the scroll's spell, dragging
his sick body, he dashed toward the nearest tunnel entrance.

He had scrolls with some healing effects but didn't want to miss the
chance to escape.

Seeing the tunnel entrance within reach and the attacking Demoness
reappearing in another corner, Nikila's heart surged with hope.

At that moment, he saw two figures in the tunnel entrance out of the
corner of his eye.

Jenna and Anthony, who had teleported using the last diamond of the
Seven-Stone Bracelet, had arrived and been lying in wait.

During the brief and weakened storm, both had been struck by lightning
but evaded the worst damage using Mirror Substitution---one from her own
ability, the other from the Mirror Substitution created by the two
Demonesses.

Seizing this chance, Anthony's eyes turned gold, radiating a dragon-like
aura.

Awe!

Fear and panic surged in Nikila's heart, leaving him disoriented, as if
facing an unbeatable predator.

Seeing the target pause and turn in circles, Jenna threw a handful of
black powder and chanted a few Hermes words.

It was one of a Witch's black magic spells.

Due to their need for materials and incantations, Jenna rarely used
these in combat, opting for the convenience of frost and black flames.

The black powder ignited, and a cold wind rose, surrounding Nikila with
ghostly figures pressing against him, covering his mouth and nose.

With this dual interference, Franca's Demoness webs wove again, sticking
Nikila in place.

Franca smiled sincerely at the Mirror Person.

With a buzz, Nikila felt his blood split, half surging upward, half
downward, his heart seeming to stop.

Under repeated Charms and his severe illness, he could no longer resist
Franca's allure.

In a daze, Nikila saw the woman, whose every detail fit his aesthetic,
beckon to him and offer a transparent triangular spike symbolizing
goodwill and control.

*I wholeheartedly accept...* With this thought, Nikila didn't
question why the webs no longer restricted him. He reached out and
grasped the triangular spike, feeling a slight sting.

His thoughts froze completely, becoming as sluggish and stiff as rusted
machine parts.

Wintry Blade!

With Nikila under control, Franca glanced at Jenna, signaling her to
find and destroy the remaining mirrors on him.

Then, Franca could form an ice spike and perform a lobotomy on Nikila.

With Lumian absent, there was no one to use the ritual leather for the
Animal Creation Spell to turn Nikila into a large hound.

Jenna nodded slightly, cutting off the lower half of Nikila's right
sleeve, and quickly took off his black wool coat. She swiftly found the
remaining five mirrors and smashed them one by one.

During this process, Nikila did not resist. He looked at Franca with a
mixture of obsession and pain, coughing intermittently.

He still held the Wintry Blade, blood trickling from his hand.

Franca's left hand formed a long, thin ice spike.

Suddenly, Nikila's expression twisted.

*Knowledge infusion from the Hidden Sage? Dammit, why now?*
Franca was first stunned, then understood the reason.

In his severely ill and dying state, Nikila was unlikely to withstand
this.

He might lose control on the spot!

In a flash, Franca discarded the ice spike and the Wintry Blade, taking
out a mirror that reflected Nikila's image. She then wiped the glass
surface with her right hand, covered in eerie black flames.

Nikila's exposed skin was marked with numerous blood-red cracks, with
strange things forming inside them.

At that moment, pitch-black flames erupted from his body, burning his
soul.

Using the blood dripping from Nikila's hand, Jenna began a curse, while
Anthony aimed the Winter is Coming revolver at Nikila, ready to use the
Certain Death effect at any moment.

Soon, the two Demonesses acted before Nikila could lose control, ending
his life completely.

Silently, Nikila fell to the void and dark ground of the mirror world,
becoming a corpse.

The eye-like objects hidden within his flesh stopped moving, unable to
emerge.

Franca quickly set up a ritual, completing the Magic Mirror Divination.

In her makeup mirror, Nikila's eerie, pale figure appeared, showing only
slight signs of losing control.

The ghost's eyes still held a trace of obsession with Franca but now
included the pain and despair of being killed by her.

*A Demoness of Affliction's Charm is terrifying... I wonder if Baby
Cupid from the Scrooge pathway can make someone fall hopelessly in love
with them too...* Franca mused with a sigh and then asked, "Are
you Griffith?"

"Yes, I am very pleased you know and remember my true name." The
mirror's Nikila smiled joyfully.

"..." Franca was momentarily speechless.

She paused for a second before asking, "Do you know what happened to
your superior, Kmerolo, one of the Ten Pillars?"
