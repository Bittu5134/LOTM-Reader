## Chapter 435: An Early Acting Principle

In the nightmare, Poet Iraeta failed to escape his deranged fate. It's
not that he isn't affected by the King's Pie game, but that he hasn't
shown it yet. Just like Painter Mullen and Novelist Anori...

*In other words, the likelihood of him already being anomalous is very
low, nothing like Elros and Albus...*

*He has a facilitator behind him, ensuring his current safety and
allowing him to transmit effective information? If that's the case, who
is the facilitator? Someone from the Sacred Heart Cloister? Did he make
many similar arrangements after discovering the turbulent undercurrents
in the cloister?* Lumian's thoughts raced faster than usual, and
he quickly made a guess.

He retracted his thoughts and focused on observing the changes in his
body after consuming the potion.

In addition to his enhanced insight, sharper and clearer thinking, and a
series of specific manifestations, like improved intelligence and the
ability to fabricate excuses to convince others, he also had superpowers
in misdirection, confusion, and deception.

These abilities were core components of conspiracies, but a qualified
Conspirer would only employ them subtly and at critical moments. Under
normal circumstances, they tried their best to rely on their wits to
prevent targets with backgrounds from detecting the existence of
superpowers and seeing through their schemes.

Similar to Misleading, there's another ability called Incitement or
Instigation. This is very much like the Demoness' Instigation. And when
Lumian played Pyromaniac, he consciously incited others to ignite the
flames in their hearts.

Lumian couldn't help but mutter, *Is my acting too advanced, or is the
Hunter pathway deepening in certain concepts? Is acting in a previous
stage an ability at the later stages?*

*Yes, the Conspirer potion revolves around conspiracies. There's no
qualitative improvement in combat...*

After repeated confirmation, Lumian realized that his physique had
improved to a certain extent, and his precise control over flames had
improved. He no longer had to rely on Fire Raven, Fireball, Spear, Fire
Serpent, and Fire Wall every time. He could casually shape the flames
into different forms, such as whips and sabers.

Similarly, the difficulty of repeatedly compressing the crimson flames
to form incandescent white flames decreased. The time required was
significantly reduced and, depending on the flame's specific appearance
and energy density, it ranged from one to three seconds.

In addition, Lumian could temporarily merge his body with fire. He could
use fireballs and other projectiles to quickly shift positions, either
escaping the enemy's attack range or closing the distance. This allowed
Lumian to have more options in battle. He didn't have to rely on Spirit
World Traversal every time.

Conspirer had also enhanced his spirituality. Although Lumian hadn't
experimented, he believed that at his limit, he could complete Spirit
World Traversal six times, up from the original four times.

Lumian sniffed and unsurprisingly caught a whiff of something further
away, discerning more details.

This was due to the enhancement of a Conspirer's information-gathering
abilities. It would inevitably enhance their five senses and spiritual
perception.

*That's about it...* Lumian stood up, his body suddenly
enveloped in flowing crimson flames.

He transformed into a fireball and flew away with a whoosh.

In less than ten meters, he landed on the ground, and flames dispersed
around him.

*The current limit is ten meters. It will gradually increase as the
potion is digested...* Lumian nodded indiscernibly and returned
to the spot where he had discarded the black satchel and the military
flask.

He was now fully aware that he was already a Sequence 6 Conspirer.

Franca held Lie and the gray amber perfume and asked with curiosity and
concern, "Very cool... How do you feel?"

Lumian pondered silently for a few seconds before saying, "The changes
in my abilities aren't as much or as strong as I imagined."

"That's normal," Franca consoled, empathetic. "For most pathways, there
are only two qualitative changes below the high Sequences. For the
Hunter pathway, one is at Sequence 7 Pyromaniac, and the other is at
Sequence 5 Reaper. Regardless, each potion brings about new abilities or
strengthening of the original abilities. If used well, it's normal for a
Sequence 6 to kill a Sequence 5."

Lumian nodded slowly, deep in thought.

"I also discovered that I've been acting as a Conspirer for a long
time..."

When he was wandering, he relied on ruthlessness and conspiracies to
fend off humans who were older than him for food and a place to sleep in
the cold. When he was in Cordu, every prank could be regarded as a
conspiracy with low malice. After leaving Cordu, he had been trapped in
conspiracies over the past few months, either screwing over his targets
or falling into the traps of others...

Although Lumian didn't digest a portion of the Conspirer potion on the
spot, it made his condition much better compared to when he first
consumed the Pyromaniac potion. The potion's potency didn't dissipate
without control.

He didn't feel like a Conspirer who had just advanced after consuming a
potion. He felt more like a Sequence 6 Beyonder who had some time to
adapt to it.

Simultaneously, he deduced two acting principles from his past
experiences:

Firstly, a Conspirer's core lay in their intelligence, not superpowers!

Secondly, the key to a conspiracy lay in concealing one's true motives!

In the past, the acting principles were derived step by step, leading to
a substantial digestion of the potion. In contrast, these two acting
principles were accumulated from past experiences. Although they
couldn't directly result in the digestion of the potion, they
facilitated Lumian's subsequent acting, reducing the time it would take
for him to fully digest the potion. To put it simply, he might only need
to spend half his energy to achieve twice the effect.

Lumian had originally believed that digesting the Conspirer potion would
take at least half a year, but from the looks of it, perhaps three
months would suffice. Of course, the prerequisite was that there would
always be a chance to act and conclude a new acting principle.

Franca shared his sentiments.

"That's right. Just like how it was easy for me to act as an Assassin. I
had too much 'experience.'"

When she said the word "experience," her voice involuntarily softened,
as if she felt a little guilty.

Lumian paid no mind to this detail. After stuffing the items on the
ground into his black satchel, he retrieved Lie, the gray amber perfume,
and the burning white candle.

Seeing that her companion was indeed fine, Franca heaved a sigh of
relief and said, "It's a good thing to advance before the catastrophe.
Damn it, if it weren't for Browns Sauron being petty and jealous of me,
preventing me from attending the orgies, my Pleasure potion would have
been significantly digested. Hmph, I'll have her experience true
pleasure later!"

For the 103rd time, she cursed Browns Sauron.

Franca then asked, "Are we going to make a move on those individuals
next?"

These individuals referred to members of the Sinners organization.

Over the past month, Lumian had repeatedly sought to capture the
Sinners' liaison through Guillaume Bénet's widow, Paulina. First, he
sought to uncover the Sanson family, seeking revenge for his sister and
tracking Loki's whereabouts---they had a deep connection to Loki.
Perhaps they knew the location of the castle where Loki had been
resurrected. Second, the Sinners organization also believed in an evil
god. It was possible they knew a little about Trier's cultists' abnormal
silence. Perhaps it could help Lumian and the others figure out the
source of the disaster and the essence of the outbreak.

Back then, Lumian hadn't figured out the pattern of the Sinners
organization's liaison, so he had postponed any operation. Later, he
planned to wait until he advanced to Sequence 6 and gained greater
strength before taking action. After all, other members of the Sinners
organization weren't like Padre Guillaume Bénet, whose contract
abilities and corresponding negative effects were grasped by him,
allowing him to prepare in advance. If the contract abilities of the
evil god bestowed synergized well, they would be quite a tough nut.

Of course, Lumian had no intention of completely annihilating the
Sinners organization by relying solely on his small team. It was a cult
with a Saint. His plan was to capture the liaison and obtain the
information he needed before calling the Tarot Club for reinforcements.

"That's right." Lumian nodded with a smile and replied to Franca, "In
two days, the Sinners' liaison will likely visit Madame Paulina again."

"Yes, I hope he knows something." Although Franca didn't think she could
prevent the potential disaster, she still hoped to do something.

She paused for a moment and continued, "Take Jenna to Lavigny Docks
tomorrow and introduce her to Mr. Fool's faith."

"Alright." Lumian had such thoughts to begin with.

___

The following morning, Lumian knocked on Apartment 601's door.

He glanced at Jenna, who had changed into a light-blue dress, and
smiled.

"I need your help with something."

"Me?" Jenna pointed at herself and turned to Franca. "How can I help?"

"Don't ask. You'll find out when you get there." Lumian couldn't be
bothered to find an excuse.

Jenna's eyes darted around in confusion.

"Dammit! Can't you make yourself clear?" As she cursed, she gestured to
Franca, indicating her helplessness.

Then, she followed Lumian out of the apartment door.

Franca fell into deep thought when she saw this scene.

___

In the four-wheeled, four-seater rental carriage, Lumian didn't mention
the purpose of his trip. He chatted with Jenna about the drunkards at
Salle de Bal Brise and the actors at Théâtre de l'Ancienne Cage à
Pigeons. The atmosphere was relaxed and cheerful, as if they were on a
school autumn outing.

Jenna didn't inquire further and displayed considerable patience.

Finally, the rental carriage arrived at Lavigny Docks. Lumian paid the
fare of 1.75 verl d'or, opened the door, and agilely leaped out.

Jenna moved to the carriage door, but before she could gracefully leap
down, her eyes narrowed as she let out Franca's usual sigh.

"Wow!"

Lumian followed her gaze and saw an ancient-looking three-masted
sailboat parked at Lavigny Docks, clearly lagging behind the times.

Such a boat was rare at Lavigny Docks, but those who had grown up
reading or listening to the The Adventurer series found it oddly
familiar.

These great pirates seemed to be fond of such boats.
