## Chapter 975: The Diligent Magic Mirror

Late at night, in room 2303 of Dechuang Garden.

Lumian, Franca, and Jenna sat side by side on the long sofa, with the
silver mirror bearing ancient patterns and black gemstones on each side
placed in front of them.

Anthony had taken Ludwig out for a late-night snack, politely avoiding
the question-and-answer session with the magic mirror Arrodes.

Of course, they had already discussed and decided which questions to ask
beforehand, focusing mainly on two parts: first, Zaratulstra's current
situation, and second, matters related to the dream city.

They had listed over twenty questions, but considering the subconscious
limitations of the dream on various aspects, they believed it impossible
to keep asking until all their doubts were answered by the magic mirror
Arrodes. They suspected that the mirror could only answer a limited
number of questions at a time or in a day, just like how Magic Mirror
Divination normally only allowed three questions. Therefore, Lumian
adjusted the order of the questions, placing the most important and
crucial ones at the beginning.

"Shall we start?" Jenna turned her head to look at Lumian.

Lumian nodded and said calmly, "I'll go."

"No, we'll take turns. We can't let you bear the mirror's questions
alone," Franca emphasized. "It must be fair!"

She felt that she should also make some sacrifices and not always let
Lumian face the terrifying questions of the magic mirror Arrodes.

Lumian glanced at her. "Alright, you go first."

Franca took a deep breath and looked at the magic mirror Arrodes.

"Great Arrodes, may I ask you a question?"

Since they had already rented the magic mirror from Star Dream
Provisions Store, she didn't follow the mystical ritual procedure and
directly inquired of the other party.

The surface of the ancient silver mirror instantly became dark, as if
sinking to the bottom of lightless waters. Rows of blood-colored words
in ancient Feysac then appeared: "I can answer any question you ask, but
you must also answer an equal number of questions from me, in the
presence of at least one witness.

"If you refuse to answer, or if you lie, you will face punishment."

Franca recalled the list of questions and carefully phrased her words,
"My question is, what are the current manifestations of Zaratulstra's
Beyonder powers in the dream city?"

This was one of the questions their team most wanted to know the answer
to.

When Lumian watched the surveillance footage and listened to the
wiretapped conversation last night, he only confirmed one point:

Zaratulstra's summoning of images from the Historical Void had
significant limitations. He wouldn't always use historical projections
to replace himself in activities while hiding in the fog of
history---before going to open the door for Jia Yu, he pulled out a past
version of himself from the Historical Void, and that historical
projection then communicated with Jia Yu for nearly a quarter of an
hour.

Based on this, Lumian speculated that Zaratulstra would only use
historical projections to replace himself for a period of time when he
felt danger or had to face certain problematic individuals. As for
disguising marionettes as his true self, Lumian believed that the
Sequence 7 Faceless ability probably couldn't achieve this, but he
didn't rule out the possibility that a similar ability descended from
Sequence 2 to Sequence 7 might be able to.

The blood-red ancient Feysac words on the surface of the magic mirror
Arrodes writhed and changed, revealing row after row:

"Zaratulstra can currently manipulate two marionettes. Through Spirit
Body Threads, He can initially control a target for 20 seconds, and
completely marionettize them in 1 minute and 30 seconds;

"His marionette manipulation range is 50 meters. He can switch positions
with the marionettes. The marionettes can use their own abilities as
well as borrow all of His abilities, but all at the Sequence 7 level;

"He can only maintain the existence of one Historical Void image at a
time, including people, objects, scenes, and spirituality;

"He can currently maintain summoned Angel-level Historical Void images
for 30 seconds to 1 minute, depending on His closeness to or
understanding of the corresponding target. If He summons His past
Sequence 1 self, it can be maintained for 1 minute and 30 seconds. If
summoning His Sequence 2 self, it's 3 minutes. His past selves below
angelic level can be maintained for up to a quarter of an hour. Other
people, objects, and scenes below angelic level range from two to ten
minutes;

"His Shapeshifting ability allows marionettes to disguise themselves as
Him, surpassing any makeup effect. However, upon careful observation,
differences can still be seen to determine authenticity;

"He can also Wish, creating some miracles, but the effects of these
miracles are still restricted to the Sequence 7 level;

"His past Sequence 1 self could make the Spirit Body Threads of the dead
or certain objects reappear, thereby marionettizing them. If one eats
marionettized food, they will be corrupted and gradually become
marionettized;

"His past Sequence 1 self could also Graft physical entities or abstract
concepts that normally couldn't be directly connected, combining them to
achieve incredible effects. However, these incredible effects are still
only at the Sequence 7 level;

"His past Sequence 1 self could distort space and time, creating a Realm
of Mysteries that surpasses the Bottle of Fiction and possesses
concealed properties;

†

"His Air Straw is twenty meters long, potentially helping Him avoid
areas densely populated with mystical pathogens."

The magic mirror Arrodes described all of Zaratulstra's abilities and
their current manifestations, causing the blood-red words on the
mirror's surface to change several times.

However, it didn't provide enough details about the Sequence 2 and
Sequence 1 level abilities, only briefly mentioning them.

*The mirror is really working hard to awaken Mr. Fool...* Franca
couldn't help but grumble inwardly after reading everything carefully.

Lumian, meanwhile, recalled the historical projection of Zaratulstra
that had conversed with Jia Yu.

Judging from the fact that they had talked for nearly a quarter of an
hour, Lumian deduced that it was a Historical Void image of Zaratulstra
before he became an Angel.

This also indicated that Zaratulstra wasn't a born mythical creature,
but had ascended step by step from lower Sequences.

After displaying Zaratulstra's current abilities, the blood-colored
words on the surface of the ancient silver mirror changed again:

"Based on the principle of reciprocity, it's my turn to ask a question.

"If you answer incorrectly or lie, you will be punished."

Franca gritted her teeth and nodded slightly.

*What do they not know about me? There's nothing to be afraid
of!*

On the mirror, new words began to form, composing a sentence: "After
entering the dream city, have you ever thought about doing something
with Lumian when Jenna wasn't around?"

*Dammit, that's harsh...* Franca didn't dare look at Jenna and
squeezed out a word through her teeth. "Yes..."

She immediately defended herself, "I just thought about it occasionally,
never put it into practice! This is Mr. Fool's dream, how dare I do
anything inappropriate? If Mr. Fool's subconscious remembers it, I'd be
socially dead for real!"

Lumian glanced at the rapidly speaking Franca and the silent Jenna,
suspecting that while making Franca feel ashamed and embarrassed, the
magic mirror Arrodes might also have a hidden intention of helping Jenna
digest the Affliction potion.

*It's really going all out to wake up Mr. Fool...*

Franca finally finished speaking and mustered the courage to look at
Jenna, receiving an encouraging smile and slight nod from her.

Lumian spoke on Franca's behalf, "The second question is, has
Zaratulstra discovered my surveillance?"

The ancient silver mirror with two black gemstones like eyes displayed
new blood-colored words: "Zaratulstra discovered that someone was spying
through mirror-like objects, but doesn't know who. He also learned about
the existence of pinhole cameras and wiretaps, because He has a
Saint-level Seer subordinate living next door who can marionettize
mosquitoes and hide them in the room to observe the situation."

*So, when I cautiously used the Fire of Destruction to burn all
spiritually imbued things in Zaratulstra's room, it made him alert that
someone had infiltrated his room. After a covert search, he discovered
the pinhole cameras and wiretaps? But because his marionette subordinate
died, he only knows someone infiltrated his room, not who it
was...* Lumian immediately analyzed the important information
hidden in the magic mirror Arrodes' answer.

At the same time, he suspected that Zaratulstra knew Mr. Huang had
concealed the fact that someone was spying through mirror-like objects
but didn't expose it on the spot.

*Moreover, knowing there was surveillance, Zaratulstra still had Jia Yu
come to his room for a private conversation. Was this to mislead us,
making us think Jia Yu was important and focus our attention there? But
his plan to poach Jia Yu wasn't a sudden decision; it should have
started before I went to spy on him in the hotel room... Does he think
that deep contact with Jia Yu holds hidden dangers, and without knowing
certain details, it could easily lead to him being kicked out of the
dream? So he deliberately exposed his intentions to let us step on the
landmine?* Lumian's thoughts were in turmoil, feeling that
Zaratulstra---this Seer---was really quite similar to a Conspirer, his
mind full of conspiracies and schemes.

Now that he knew Zaratulstra had discovered his spying and had been
acting all along, Lumian could design targeted action plans.

Demonesses had ways and abilities to evade the dangerous premonitions of
a Seer!

After answering, the magic mirror Arrodes routinely displayed the
corresponding prompt before posing a question to Lumian: "Is your
feeling for Franca and Jenna love, or just valuing them?"

Lumian fell momentarily quiet before responding, "I value them."

After a few seconds of silence in the sofa area, Jenna moved forward
slightly and said, "It's my turn to ask."

Lumian and Franca both nodded.

Jenna recalled the list of prepared questions and looked at the ancient
silver mirror.

"The third question is, who was the last person to rent you?"

The blood-red words on the mirror's surface suddenly disappeared,
leaving only a faint shimmer of water.

After several seconds, a few words appeared on the deep, dark surface of
the mirror---the unique text of the dream city, all in a pale white
color: "It's Peng Deng."

*Peng Deng? The person who spent 220,000 to rent the magic mirror
Arrodes for a day was Peng Deng?* Lumian, Franca, and Jenna were
all shocked.
