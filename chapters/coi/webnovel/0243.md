## Chapter 243: Visit

Lumian's fury did not mean he would lose his composure---to just
disguise himself and sneak into the member of parliament's office, where
he would find the fellow who had dared to "casually spit" and incinerate
him on the spot.

It wasn't a ridiculous scheme, but without enough information, taking
such a risk could easily turn into suicide.

First and foremost, Lumian had no knowledge of the number or strength of
the heretics present in the member of parliament's office.

He also had no idea how many protectors Bureau 8 or the two Churches had
assigned to Hugues Artois, nor did he know their abilities.

Furthermore, he lacked precise details about the target's whereabouts or
situation. Even if he managed to infiltrate the office successfully,
finding the target would be no easy task.

Lastly, he hadn't yet devised a plan for sneaking in and, more
importantly, a plan for a safe retreat.

Nevertheless, Lumian couldn't deny that the chaos caused by the
Goodville Chemical Factory explosion provided an excellent opportunity
for his infiltration.

For now, his temporary strategy was to be a patient hunter. He would
trail the target silently, observing his movements and waiting for the
perfect moment to strike.

Based on the target's status in Hugo Artois's campaign, Lumian surmised
that the man couldn't be too powerful. He certainly didn't possess
godlike abilities. Even if he were a Mid-Sequence Beyonder, he would
likely be no higher than a Sequence 7.

Lumian wasn't overly concerned if his judgment was wrong and the target
turned out to be a Sequence 6 or even Sequence 5. In fact, he believed
that Mr. K would find the hunt for heretics quite intriguing!

*Phew...* Lumian breathed out slowly, his gaze fixed on the
brightly illuminated khaki-colored four-story building. He continued to
gather useful information for his upcoming operation.

As time passed, he noticed middle-aged scavengers carrying linen bags,
sifting through the trash piled beside the building.

This sight made Lumian sigh, fueling the fire of determination in his
heart.

In Trier, people couldn't scavenge just for the sake of it. Each
scavenger had an employer, whether they worked full-time or part-time.
They were assigned specific scavenging areas and were not allowed to
cross boundaries. Violations often led to conflicts and violent
encounters. As a result, Ruhr and Michel wished fervently that Hugues
Artois would host banquets every day instead of wandering into areas
where banquets were already being held, as those spots belonged to other
scavengers.

The difference between full-time and part-time scavengers lay in their
employment terms. Full-timers received a monthly salary from their
employers, and the employers owned all the trash they collected.
Occasionally, if they stumbled upon valuable or usable items, they might
decide whether to surrender them or keep them for personal use.
Part-timers like Ruhr and Michel didn't have a fixed salary. They
scavenged in the morning and evening, delivering everything they found
to a designated waste disposal site, typically owned by their employers.

These circumstances restricted street tramps to scavenging for food and
clothing, with little opportunity to exchange their findings for money.

Lumian patiently waited until 9 p.m., observing as the number of guests
visiting the member of parliament's office gradually dwindled. People
stepped out onto the balconies for a smoke or a brief respite.

And then, his eyes widened as he spotted a figure.

Standing on the balcony of a second-floor room, there he was---the thin,
pale man with curly dark-yellow hair and piercing brown eyes.

Dressed in a blue shirt, black vest, and a somber suit, complete with a
bow tie, he held a cigarette, enveloped in a cloud of smoke,
occasionally taking a drag. Lumian had seen him before in Franca's Magic
Mirror Divination. It was the spitter.

*Cough, cough, cough! *A fit of violent coughing shook the frail
young man, as if he wished to expel his lungs from his body.

Finally, he hacked up another glob of thick phlegm after some
harrumphing.

Pulling out a handkerchief, he spat the viscous phlegm into it, wrapping
it up and tucking it away in his pocket. He didn't discard it
carelessly.

Lumian's eyes narrowed. *He knows that his phlegm can transmit diseases
as a result of mysticism.*

As more people flocked to the balconies of their respective rooms,
Lumian swiftly identified the familiar faces.

Member of Parliament Hugues Artois from the market district occupied the
room at the top floor, boasting the largest balcony.

The red-haired woman resided on the same floor, right next door to him.

On the second floor, on the opposite end of the corridor from the
spitter, was a man in his thirties with gold-rimmed glasses, a document
always in hand. Every now and then, he would wander to the balcony to
enjoy a smoke and the view, displaying a lack of concern for the
aftermath of the Goodville Chemical Factory explosion.

The third floor housed a tall, muscular middle-aged man, occupying the
central office.

Directly beneath Hugues Artois, on the fourth floor, was a refined young
woman in a white shirt and a dark-blue coat. She shared the same side of
the building as the man with gold-rimmed glasses, deliberately avoiding
any proximity to the spitter.

Lumian observed closely and deduced that the rooms adjacent to the
spitter's were part of a collective office, likely accommodating several
employees.

This implied that the probability of them holding any significant status
or possessing Beyonder powers was negligible.

*So, the other heretics intentionally distanced themselves from the
incessant coughing and spitting man. They believe the member of
parliament's office is heavily guarded, and that individual possesses
Beyonder powers. It's highly unlikely for an attack to be directed at
him. True enough. If an assault were to occur in the member of
parliament's office, the target would undoubtedly be Hugues Artois and
not one of his subordinates. Only then would it be worth the
risk...* Lumian pondered this realization earnestly for a moment
and suddenly sensed an opportunity emerging.

The dilemma now lay in how Lumian could infiltrate the member of
parliament's office unnoticed, particularly given his conspicuous golden
hair with a touch of black. After all, he didn't have Franca's help.

After careful consideration, Lumian devised a plan.

He departed from the vicinity of the office and made his way back to the
safe house on Rue des Blouses Blanches.

Without hesitation, he set up an altar and offered a prayer to the great
existence, seeking His protection.

Lumian firmly believed that since the embrace of an angel would shield
him from the prying eyes of any deity, it definitely ensured sufficient
anti-divination effects!

Just as before, he found himself bathed in the radiant brilliance and
divine majesty of the angel. Overwhelmed by indescribable emotions, he
witnessed cascades of luminous wings enveloping him.

Once he completed this ritual, Lumian pressed his hand to his head.

His golden and black hair erupted into flames, cascading down like
withered grass until only a few hair roots remained.

Putting on his trusty dark-blue cap, he concealed his features behind
the Mystery Prying Glasses. With his transformed appearance, Lumian left
Rue des Blouses Blanches and ventured towards Avenue du Marché near Le
Marché du Quartier du Gentleman. There, he located a clothing store that
didn't specialize in cheap garments.

The two shop assistants, a man and a woman, were taken aback when they
saw a person dressed like a vagrant entering, unsure of how to react.

In a panicked tone, Lumian explained, "I encountered a perverted thief
who stole my clothes and trousers. I had no choice but to purchase this
set from a nearby beggar."

The female shop assistant struggled to suppress her laughter.

They had witnessed similar situations countless times before, well aware
that those who made such excuses were often involved in affairs with
certain ladies, fleeing in a state of undress with their wallets once
their husbands returned, only to seek refuge in the garments of a
beggar.

When someone confidently claimed that their predicament stemmed from an
affair, it usually meant they had genuinely encountered a twisted thief.

In the end, Lumian acquired a suit that appeared decent but was actually
quite ordinary. It included a shirt, coat, bow tie, and a dark cane.
Additionally, he opted for a brown wig and a matching fake beard.

The total cost came to 78 verl d'or.

After carefully covering his tracks and returning to the safe house on
Rue des Blouses Blanches, Lumian shed his disguise and once again
adorned the Mystery Prying Glasses. Following his recollection, he
skillfully applied makeup to achieve his desired effect.

His aim was to transform himself into an older version. As he gazed into
the mirror, Lumian gradually took on the appearance of a middle-aged
man, complete with a fake brown beard affixed to his mouth and chin.

Thus, Lumian assumed the identity of Bono Goodville, the proprietor of
the Goodville Chemical Factory.

Though the resemblance was only around 40 to 50%, anyone acquainted with
Bono Goodville would instinctively mistake Lumian for the man, provided
they didn't scrutinize or closely distinguish him.

In this guise, Lumian intended to infiltrate the member of parliament's
office!

Before embarking on his mission, he ventured into the underground and
stashed the tramp's attire in a cavern within the quarry.

Emerging from Underground Trier, Lumian hastened to the khaki-colored
four-story building that housed the member of parliament's office, cane
in hand.

After observing for a brief moment and ensuring that the figures in each
room remained relatively unchanged, he lowered his head, partially
concealing his face, and approached the entrance.

"Whom are you seeking?" inquired an armed guard donned in a dark blue
uniform, blocking his path.

Lumian raised his head, withdrew his hand, and responded with anxiety in
his voice, "I'm looking for the member of parliament."

One of the guards caught a clear glimpse of the visitor's face under the
glow of the street lamp and involuntarily exclaimed, "Monsieur
Goodville, what brings you here again..."

Abruptly, he halted his words, realizing that this gentleman, who had
recently experienced a devastating explosion at his factory, had an
abundance of issues to address this night, along with numerous concerns
that required assistance.

The two guards refrained from further inquiry and stepped aside,
granting Lumian passage.

The lobby on the ground floor bustled with activity, despite the late
hour. Reporters, officials, representatives of charitable organizations,
hospital staff reporting in, and various personnel responsible for
receiving them filled the space.

Lumian preserved his desire to remain inconspicuous. With his head
lowered, partially obscuring his face, he proceeded directly to the
staircase. Employing the same tactic, he passed by the two armed guards
and ascended to the second floor.

Orienting himself, Lumian bypassed the two employees who emerged from a
nearby room and arrived in front of the office belonging to the
unhealthy young man.

Embedded on the vermilion door was an aluminum-white nameplate inscribed
with a few golden Intisian words: "Assistant Secretary, Tybalt Jacques."

*Tybalt...* Lumian smiled, donned his gloves, and tapped lightly
on the door.
