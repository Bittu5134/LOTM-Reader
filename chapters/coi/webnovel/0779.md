## Chapter 779: Pirate Haven

Banamo Port.

As Lumian strolled along the streets, he couldn't shake the feeling that
he had arrived in Backlund, the capital of the Loen Kingdom. Although he
had never been there, the foggy sky and damp, cold environment mirrored
Trier's newspapers and magazines' mockery of Backlund.

Of course, the architectural style here was distinctly different from
Backlund's. There were two main types: one was large yet not crude, with
typical Feysac characteristics, and the other was a mix of stone and
wood, simple and rough, often crowded together without any clear
planning.

Most of the people on the streets were dressed like typical pirates,
with short knives strapped to their waists and guns tucked into their
belts, not bothering to conceal their weapons. In contrast, the locals
with dark-brown skin always wore smiles, their faces full of deference.

Lumian fully understood the mindset of the natives. After all, angering
a pirate could result in being dragged into a corner and killed, or
having someone sneak into their home at night to murder them. The killer
would then sail away on their pirate ship without a care.

The current rulers of Banamo Island were trying to recruit pirates and
adventurers to maintain order and hoped the great pirates would agree on
a pirate code to regulate behavior in the port. However, these measures
had limited effectiveness.

This was because seasoned pirates couldn't suddenly start obeying laws
and strict rules, even if they became sheriffs or police officers.
Moreover, there wasn't a strong enough force on the island to keep them
in check. As a result, it was common for sheriffs to break the law and
accept bribes to shield criminals.

The pirate code, agreed upon by the great pirates, wasn't mandatory.
Even if someone broke it, they would only face minor punishment within
their own crew. No one would hand over their own men to be dealt with by
others.

These measures' greatest effect was making Banamo Port appear somewhat
orderly. As Lumian admired the bustling street scenes, he occasionally
heard screams or gunshots from the alleys.

*This place is perfect for a Hunter*, he thought, genuinely
appreciating it.

When two groups of pirates started a brawl in the middle of the street,
Lumian had a sudden idea: *A large-scale plague for a Demoness of
Despair advancement ritual could work here...*

*But I would need to develop medicine to prevent infection or severe
illness and secretly distribute it to the locals...*

*The only problem is that there aren't 30,000 pirates here. However,
there are quite a few Beyonders among them. Infecting them and causing
them suffering and despair should significantly reduce the number needed
for the ritual...*

As Lumian watched the pirate brawl with interest, he pondered the
feasibility of holding the Demoness of Despair ritual in Banamo Port.

When the fight was almost over, the sheriffs finally arrived, dispersing
the two groups and symbolically arresting a few people.

They were just waiting for the respective pirate crews to pay the fines!

As for the grievances between the two groups, the sheriffs didn't care.
If they wanted revenge, they would have to settle it out at sea.

Meanwhile, adventurers and locals quietly dragged away some of the
pirate corpses left on the street.

Lumian felt like applauding this kind of order.

Taking advantage of the remaining daylight and the sun filtering through
the fog, he continued his leisurely stroll through Banamo Port.

Passing a stone house with a small square, he saw a dozen or so people
gathered, mostly locals. A pirate wearing a bicorne hat and blue woolen
clothes stood on a stone platform in front of them.

The pirate was shouting in Feysac, "You're just a bunch of pups fresh
from your mother's embrace. If you want to become proper pirates, you
need training. Today, I'll give you your first lesson: who you can and
can't mess with at sea..."

Feysac was the language with the least difference from ancient Feysac.
Lumian, skilled in ancient Feysac, barely understood what the pirate was
saying. He realized that the pirate crew was recruiting newcomers and
providing basic training.

*Why does this feel like a big company in Trier hiring new
employees...* Lumian grumbled to himself as he watched the
pirate display wanted posters and portraits, introducing the six kings,
nine admirals, and notable adventurers.

This was exactly the information Lumian needed. He stopped and listened
from a distance.

As expected, he saw a portrait and detailed introduction of Louis Berry.

At the end, the pirate with the bicorne hat pointed to a portrait and
said, "His bounty isn't high, but you must never underestimate him, or
even have any contact with him."

*No contact at all?* Lumian focused on the portrait, seeing a
burly man in his thirties with thick brown body hair, wearing suspenders
and a white shirt.

The pirate's tone became serious as he introduced the man to the new
pirates, "His name is Frank Lee, the first mate of the Queen of Stars.
He's a Druid.

"What is a Druid? I'll explain when we cover Beyonder knowledge. For
now, just know that a Druid is Sequence 5, on par with the Pirate
Admirals. So, understand how terrifying Frank Lee is?

"But that's not the main reason adventurers and pirates fear him. I
don't know the exact reason either. I only know that every pirate and
adventurer who's encountered Frank Lee acts like they've gone mad. They
jump out of their chairs and sometimes vomit when his name is mentioned.
They always warn me to stay away from Frank Lee and not to leave any
blood near him or eat anything found around him..."

*So, the legendary Druid Frank Lee is the first mate of the Pirate
King... But why are so many pirates and adventurers so terrified of him?
Even if he has the strength of a Pirate Admiral and is ruthless, it
shouldn't cause this reaction...* Lumian silently mused as he
listened to the pirate's introduction.

He was curious about what made Frank Lee so special.

After watching the pirate crew's recruitment, Lumian headed to the
nearby Carnival Bar.

He pushed through the unapologetically pirate crowd and sat on a high
stool at the bar, ordering a Lanti Proof.

The common language in Banamo Port was Feysac, but pirates spoke various
languages, and few were multilingual. Those who spoke Feysac formed one
circle, those who spoke Intisian another, and so on. Lumian chose the
Carnival Bar because all its signage was in Intisian.

In the noisy, lively environment, Lumian took two sips of his drink, put
down his glass, and asked the bartender loudly in Intisian, "Do you have
detailed information on the nine Pirate Admirals? Something beyond the
wanted posters."

Suddenly, the entire bar went silent. Every pirate turned to look at
Lumian at the bar.

It became so quiet that the sound of someone swallowing could be heard.

The bartender's expression turned awkward and amused. He asked Lumian,
"Are you an adventurer?"

An adventurer coming to a pirate bar to ask for detailed information on
the Pirate Admirals!

Lumian didn't answer the bartender. He half-turned to look at the
staring pirates.

Around him, one by one, crimson-white fireballs began to form and float
in the air.

Lumian smiled, raising his chin slightly. "Even though your bounties are
low and I don't want to bother, if anyone wants to give me money
voluntarily, I won't mind accepting it."

The pirates' expressions changed, but Lumian's gaze remained steady. He
scanned their faces and sneered. "Anyone want to try?"

Silence. The entire Carnival Bar remained silent.

Everyone could feel the danger in those crimson-white fireballs.

Lumian stopped provoking them, pointing to a chair a few meters behind
him.

"Don't appear behind me. Don't think about using the crowd to get close
and assassinate me.

"If anyone crosses that chair, I'll kill them."

After speaking, Lumian turned back, smiling at the bartender amid the
fireballs.

"Now, you can answer my question."

Seeing this adventurer not introduce himself or boast about his
exploits, but show absolute confidence and a nonchalant attitude toward
killing, the bartender forced a smile.

"We know about the same as the wanted posters. If you want more hidden
details, ask the enemies of the Pirate Admirals. Emperor Roselle once
said the person who knows you best is your enemy."

"Tell me about each Pirate Admiral's enemies," Lumian said, taking
another sip of his Lanti Proof.

In the bar, the pirates resumed their conversations, while some quietly
left, seemingly to find help upon seeing the adventurer easily maintain
the fireballs.

Lumian didn't stop them or even look their way.

When the bartender finished, Lumian had a general understanding of who
Admiral Deep Sea Howl Constantine's enemies were. This Pirate Admiral
with sea monster blood was usually low-key and mysterious. Besides doing
pirate work in a bloody and brutal manner, he rarely clashed with other
Pirate Admirals or major forces. However, the former Vice Admiral Dusk,
now the King of Dusk, Bulatov Ivan, suspected Howl Constantine's two
"submarine ships" came from a legendary sea treasure, the Lost Newins.
He targeted Admiral Deep Sea, seeking information on the Newins, leading
to multiple conflicts.

When Bulatov became a king over the seas, Admiral Deep Sea Howl
Constantine had no choice but to avoid this powerhouse and his fleet.
