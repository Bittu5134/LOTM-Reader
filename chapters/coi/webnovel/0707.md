## Chapter 707: Compulsion

In the dark, silent tunnel, Franca advanced slowly, holding the
Primordial Demoness figurine made of bone. Her footsteps were so soft
they were nearly inaudible.

Lumian, clutching his carbide lamp, and Jenna trailed silently behind
her.

With a Hunter's keen understanding of the terrain and memories, the
three had finished exploring the area where they had obtained the
classic silver mirror. They had even expanded their search to include
the nearby underground tunnels and connected quarry caves.

However, the Primordial Demoness figurine showed no abnormal reactions,
and neither Franca nor Jenna sensed anything out of the ordinary.

Franca sighed. "Well, this is disappointing. Bold assumptions leading to
a shameful failure!"

She had no intention of giving up, but wanted to return to the surface
first and contact 007. She hoped to use the authorities' detailed
records of underground abnormalities to search for any areas where a
high-level Demoness's power might be seeping out.

Having experienced numerous mystical incidents, Lumian surveyed the
area, pondering for a few seconds.

"Let's investigate again. This time, I'll extinguish the carbide lamp.

"In mysticism, Demonesses and the mirror world are always associated
with darkness, evil, and quiet depth. Perhaps subtle reactions can occur
in the absence of light."

"Subtle reactions... What is this, a chemistry experiment?" Franca
scoffed, but chose to comply. She turned to Jenna. "Hold your Mirror
World Fragment in your hand. If we're giving this a shot, we should try
everything."

Jenna took out the Mirror World Fragment she had obtained from the
Tamara family tomb, and Lumian turned the switch to extinguish the
carbide lamp.

The silent tunnel plunged into absolute darkness. As a Hunter, Lumian
couldn't see a thing.

"You can hold onto my sleeve," Jenna suggested calmly. "Or activate your
Spirit Vision and follow our spiritual light."

Lumian replied with a smile, "That would make me look weak. I suspect
you're deliberately showing off. Have you forgotten? I can gain night
vision by changing my life form."

Jenna was silent for a moment before retorting, "Dammit! Would it kill
you to be a bit nicer about it?"

"She's right," Franca agreed. "Jenna was just trying to help. It's fine
if you don't want her assistance, but there's no need to mock her."

"That's a Hunter for you." Lumian chuckled as he activated the black
mark on his body, transforming into a shadow creature.

He blended into the shadows and followed Franca and Jenna as they
explored the area for the second time.

As Franca passed a corner of a quarry cave, she suddenly felt the bone
figurine in her hand tremble slightly.

"There's a reaction! There's a reaction!" she exclaimed joyfully.

Lumian immediately left the shadows, transforming back into human form,
his blue eyes tinged with silver-black.

In the absolute darkness, he saw the mercury rivers of fate belonging to
Franca and Jenna.

As his spirituality rapidly depleted from the brief observation, Lumian
found a possibility among the tributaries symbolizing Franca's future
fate.

This was something that might happen in ten seconds or more.
Furthermore, the probability of it occurring was extremely
low---something Curse, or rather, Magnify, couldn't influence.

Without hesitation, Lumian extended his right palm toward Franca.

Franca, with her night vision, witnessed his actions and noticed his
silver-black eyes. She jumped in fright.

"W-what are you doing?"

She didn't dodge, fully trusting Lumian.

Lumian roused his spirituality, transforming it into a violent illusory
river that surged out of his palm.

Franca's fate was instantly thrust into a future by the mighty torrent.

Compelling Fate!

Franca suddenly had an idea.

"Are you influencing my future, allowing me to successfully utilize the
corrupted fate fragments here to make it a reality?

"Dammit, I really do have an idea. Maybe I should give it a try!"

Lumian, his spirituality greatly depleted, chuckled. "Life is short, why
not give it a try?"

"..." Franca could clearly detect the mockery in his tone. She gritted
her teeth. "I'll deal with you later!"

As she spoke, Franca placed the Primordial Demoness's bone figurine on a
protruding rock in a corner of the mine. Then she took out a mirror and
placed it in front of the figurine.

Lumian conjured a blazing white fireball and observed as Franca
retrieved essential oils, extracts, perfume, and herbal powder from her
Traveler's Bag, preparing for the ritual.

*Uh...* Lumian turned to Jenna, who happened to look back at
him.

Franca simultaneously turned to face them.

The three were taken aback for a moment before bursting into laughter.

"You two thought of it too?" Franca said happily. "Jenna shouldn't stay
here. The Primordial Demoness might cast Her gaze here later."

As a pure female Demoness, it would definitely not bode well for Jenna
to be noticed by the Primordial Demoness. It could even mean death.

Lumian replied with a smile, "I'll send Jenna back first and come back
after the ritual."

With that, he reached out and grabbed Jenna's shoulder.

Jenna said to Franca, "Be careful."

"Don't worry, I'm a skilled worker," Franca replied, waving her hand
cheerfully.

As a member of the Demoness Sect, she regularly prayed to the Primordial
Demoness through the bone figurine, following the Demoness of Black's
instructions. Occasionally, she even held a solo Mass.

Of course, this was the first time she would be praying to the
Primordial Demoness through a ritual.

After Lumian teleported away with Jenna, the quarry cave returned to
darkness.

With the bone figurine, Franca decided to use a dualistic ritual.

After lighting the candle representing herself, she drew her needs on a
faux goatskin with the corresponding symbols and patterns, drawing upon
her extensive mysticism knowledge.

Following that, she sanctified the ritual silver dagger and created a
wall of spirituality. She dripped rose essential oil, musk, and perfume
into the candle flame.

Franca's heart skipped a beat as the alluring, complex scent quickly
entered her nostrils. She couldn't help but inhale deeply.

After completing all the preparations, Franca took two steps back and
recited the Primordial Demoness's honorific name in Hermes.

"The source of all catastrophes, the symbol of destruction and the
apocalypse, the Demoness who controls Chaos."

In the altar, a small amount of moss suddenly grew, entangling into
vines that rose high, as if staring at Franca.

The ground softened, and a frigid wind blew, causing Franca to tremble.

Simultaneously, Franca sensed the fragrance in the area grow sweeter,
carrying a warm charm that made her blush.

This invigorated her specific desires, and charming scenes surfaced in
her mind.

Suppressing the heat in her body and shaking off her discomfort, Franca
briefly recounted how Moran Avigny was a Mirror Person and how she
wanted to capture him. Then, following the ritual's standard procedure,
she said,

"I pray for the power of the mirror.

"I pray for the power of chaos.

"I pray for God's protection.

"I pray for a fixed entrance to the mirror world to appear here.

"Roses, a herb that belongs to the Demoness, please pass your power to
my incantation.

"Musk, a herb that belongs to the Demoness, please pass your power to my
incantation..."

After reciting the incantation, Franca ignited the faux goatskin and
placed it on the mirror in front of the bone figurine.

As the faux goatskin burned away, Franca felt the candle flame dim, as
if a layer of translucent mullioned glass had materialized around it.

A strange power was activated, gathering in the mirror.

The human-head-sized mirror suddenly darkened, turning shadowy and
illusory.

It melded with the protruding rock where the figurine was placed and
vanished.

In the next moment, the candle flame returned to normal, and the
fragrance lingering in the air still unsettled Franca. Her thoughts
raced, requiring immense strength to control herself.

After tidying up the bone figurine and other items, Franca took a deep
breath and exhaled slowly.

*Dammit, just the charm and pleasure emanating from the ritual nearly
made me lose myself. All I wanted was to approach the source of the
charm and enjoy the pleasures bestowed by Her.*

*As expected of the Primordial Demoness who controls pleasure and
feminine charm...*

*Dammit! I'm an idiot. Why did I take a deep breath? The smell here
hasn't dissipated!*

*I need to quickly confirm if there's an entrance to the mirror world
before heading back to Jenna...*

As these thoughts raced through Franca's mind, she saw Lumian's figure
swiftly materialize at the edge of the quarry cave.

Franca jumped in fright. "Why are you back already?"

Lumian chuckled. "You're in pretty good shape. Didn't I say I'd return
after your ritual...?"

As he spoke, Lumian noticed Franca's lake-blue eyes rippling under the
dim candlelight, as if they could captivate one's soul.

Lumian's words faltered.

After a brief pause, he added, "Besides, Jenna was worried about you and
asked me to come check on you.

"I believe the Primordial Demoness can understand that a Demoness of
Pleasure has a friend who cares about her."

"Yeah." Franca nodded gently, bit her lip, and pointed at the protruding
rock. "That spot seems to have become a fixed entrance to the mirror
world. Let's see if we can enter."

Lumian didn't inquire further. He approached the protruding rock and,
together with Franca, extended his right palm, pressing it against the
cold stone.

A faint light flickered, and the two vanished on the spot.

After a brief moment of vertigo, a dark, illusory path appeared before
Lumian and Franca's eyes. Surrounding them were numerous similar
"tunnels," intertwining to form a complicated and mysterious colossal
spiderweb.
