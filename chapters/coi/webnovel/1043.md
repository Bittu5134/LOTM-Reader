## Chapter 1043: Unaging

While changing clothes, Lumian examined the changes in himself after
becoming a Demoness of Unaging.

Because of the reconciliation, his Mirror Person's consciousness had
returned to his body. Whether it was his reflection in the mirror or
himself outside it, they were now both him---different parts sharing a
single consciousness.

In other words, he had the sensation of being both outside and within
the mirror simultaneously. Even walking in sunlight, he would partially
experience another self moving hesitantly forward in darkness.

This also allowed him to see both the reality and the changes within
mirrors simultaneously.

Furthermore, in the past, when a Mirror Person died, it would split off
from the body again to revive. Now, the body had the same privilege---if
it died, it would revive through the Mirror Person.

Simply put, the death of either the body or the Mirror Person alone was
no longer true death for a Demoness of Unaging---it was more like a
partial injury that could be healed.

Additionally, a Demoness of Unaging could have multiple Mirror Persons.
Lumian could use environments with multiple mirrors to temporarily
multiply his Mirror Persons---as long as one survived, he wouldn't truly
die. He could also use blood, hair, skin, or other media to create a
Mirror Person sleeping within a mirror, hiding that mirror in a secret
place under anti-divination conditions, cutting off corresponding
mystical connections to prevent curses and other harm from affecting the
sleeping Mirror Person.

This way, even if his body and other Mirror Persons were killed, as long
as this hidden mirror remained unfound, Lumian could revive through the
sleeping Mirror Person.

This was the source of the Demoness of Unaging's bizarre resistance to
death and skill at revival: the self in the mirror and the self outside
are both me!

Without this special characteristic, revival through this method would
be impossible, which was why Lumian couldn't help others create sleeping
Mirror Persons.

*Does reconciliation mean both inside and outside the mirror are me?
While enslavement and infatuation mean the mirror self is either not me
or just my appendage?* Just as Lumian thought this, an illusory
starfield suddenly appeared before his eyes, revealing countless
brilliant stars.

Some of these stars were very bright and large, hidden in the depths of
darkness, while others seemed nearby yet remained untouchable.

*Wh---* Lumian's pupils, clear and dreamy like a highland lake,
suddenly dilated.

He felt his Unaging potion had been completely digested!

*What's going on?*

*How had it been fully digested right after drinking it and completing
the advancement?*

He hadn't even begun acting the role of a Demoness of Unaging yet!

Amid confusion, bewilderment, and perplexity, various thoughts flashed
through Lumian's mind until he arrived at an extraordinarily joyful
speculation:

This was brought about by the further awakening of Aurore's soul
fragment!

*Has Aurore further awakened through this state of being both inside and
outside the mirror, through me and my Mirror Person? She's now
effectively part of me, and any part of me can eventually be revived
through the Mirror Person, so has she gained this characteristic
too?*

*Given the name, surely the act of a Demoness of Unaging doesn't require
maintaining an unaging mentality and appearance over hundreds or
thousands of years? The unaging appearance is easily solved---a Demoness
of Unaging naturally maintains their appearance. But an unaging
mentality is much more difficult and would take a very long time. Yet
Aurore is from thousands or tens of thousands of years ago, or even
longer, and has been sleeping the whole time. Upon returning to reality
in the current era, her mentality is indeed still quite young,
completely unaging...*

*Aurore is now part of me, one of my aspects. If her mental, spiritual,
and soul state perfectly matches the requirements of the Unaging potion,
it's as if I match them too, so the potion naturally digested
quickly...*

Lumian nodded thoughtfully.

What made him happiest wasn't that the Unaging potion had been
completely digested in such a short time, but that he had truly seen and
felt Aurore's awakening.

This was indeed the first step in reviving Aurore!

Lumian continued examining the changes in his state.

*Hmm, I can separate out Mirror Persons for special hiding, and since
the potion is fully digested, it's increased to two.*

*I've truly gained the Petrification ability, no longer requiring hair
contact. However, Petrification still can't take effect on targets
across thin air---either it must spread inch by inch from nearby until
it reaches and covers the enemy, or it must use the Demoness's spider
silk to transmit the corresponding power...*

*My eyes are now equivalent to mirrors. Whatever I see can become a
target for curses, and I can use my eyes as a medium along with my
Mirror Person transformation to directly enter the mirror
world...*

*If I manifest an incomplete Mythical Creature form, my hair will become
serpents, each with a clear black and white eye on its head. Whatever
these eyes see can be petrified from thin air...*

*My utilization of the mirror world has clearly strengthened. I can
forcibly pull people of lower standing into the mirror world without
them noticing. For Saints and Angels of equal or higher standing,
success and detection depend on their state. I can even pull an entire
house or street into the mirror world---what exactly gets pulled in is
up to me, it doesn't have to be done as a whole...*

*I can now directly transmit power through the mirror world. Combined
with Mirror Projection, I can sit at home and 'manifest' power anywhere
in Trier using positioned mirrors. The power attached to this Mirror
Projection cannot exceed Sequence 4...*

*"The Hunter pathway is still only at Sequence 5, with no new fusion
abilities, but Precision can help me 'manifest' power in three different
places...*

*All Mirror Projections cannot leave their corresponding mirror's
reflection range...*

*At the Demoness of Unaging level, I can control mirrors within a
fifteen-kilometer range and those I've visited before---this can cover
an entire small city...*

*The Plague range has reached ten kilometers and can spread outward on
its own, though the types of plagues haven't increased...*

*Each spider silk is now like my arm...*

*I can perfectly display the charm of women at every age, with skin
condition and facial features either matching or contrasting...*

*As long as there's a physical medium, Curses can not only affect the
target but also their direct relatives. With large-scale, special black
magic, crucial media, and arrangements, curses might even harm Angels.
Other aspects haven't changed much...*

*Other Demoness abilities have also improved accordingly...*

*That bizarre state of the Demoness of Black earlier really had nothing
to do with the Demoness of Unaging itself, or perhaps it depends on
which ritual was chosen during advancement?*

After this examination, Lumian looked around, then traversed back to his
bedroom.

By this time, Madam Magician was gone.

Madam Magician said that the magic robe couldn't be worn too long. After
confirming you were fine, she left to get some rest and will return
later," Jenna explained upon seeing him.

Franca asked eagerly, "Did the ritual succeed? Are you now a Demoness of
Unaging?"

Her spiritual intuition told her this was the case.

Lumian nodded and smiled. "Yes, we reconciled."

Before Franca could ask more, he casually said, "The Unaging potion has
also been completely digested."

"Huh?" "What?" Jenna and Franca exclaimed in surprise.

Lumian smiled at Franca. "If you became a Demoness of Unaging, you'd be
able to digest the potion quickly too."

"Ah, me?" Franca paused, pointing at herself, then asked with some
speculation, "Does the acting of a Demoness of Unaging focus on time
scale and the unaging state?"

She thought carefully---she really was an ancient relic, and she truly
wasn't aging now, in any aspect.

With a nod, Lumian replied, "I believe the most important acting
principle is maintaining an unaging mentality over the erosion of time,
over hundreds or thousands of years."

"It's true then..." Franca nodded slowly, "Did the Celestial Worthy make
us hang on that light gate for thousands or tens of thousands of years,
causing us to perfectly match such acting? His intentions were bad, but
the outcome was good?"

Understanding what they were talking about, Jenna looked at Lumian and
asked, "You relied on Aurore?"

"I now truly feel that Aurore is one of my aspects, a part of me,"
Lumian didn't hide it.

Jenna smiled with complex emotions and empathy. "That's wonderful."

She thought of her mother and father---she also had people she wanted to
revive, but there was no hope now.

Lumian then told Franca and Jenna in great detail about his dialogue
with his Mirror Person and his feelings during advancement, finally
saying, "Reconciliation brings unity between the self in and outside the
mirror. The other two methods probably don't work---the Mirror Person
would remain one's male self.

"I think the prerequisite for reconciliation is that both parties have a
common goal for which one is willing to sacrifice themselves, and the
Mirror Person has no better options. Then negotiations become possible."

Franca fell into deep thought.

Lumian looked at Jenna and after some consideration said, "If earlier my
Mirror Person had deceived me, instigated me, replaced me, since his
core is male, the advancement ritual would have failed. From this, you
could have determined that the one who came out of the mirror was the
Mirror Person and responded accordingly.

"But for purely female demonesses, there isn't this restriction. If your
Mirror Person replaced you, they could still perform the ritual and
become a Demoness of Unaging. This would make it impossible for anyone
to notice that the real you had been silently replaced."

"You think this might be related to the potential horrifying experiences
pure female demonesses might face when advancing to Demoness of
Unaging?" Jenna understood what Lumian was really trying to warn about.

Lumian nodded."This surely isn't everything, but it might be part of
it."

After talking further, Lumian asked Franca, "Do you want to perform the
ritual today, or prepare for a while longer?"

Franca ruminated for a few seconds before saying, "I want to try.

"If my Mirror Person has my memories from before transmigrating, rather
than being dominated by the original body's residual consciousness, I
think... I think I might be able to persuade him."
