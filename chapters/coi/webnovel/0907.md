## Chapter 907: Corpse

Lumian examined Oracle Danitz's deep blue eyes for a few seconds, then
gave Jenna a meaningful look.

Now, Franca no longer needed to digest the Affliction potion.

Jenna instantly understood Lumian's intention and asked Oracle Danitz
with a smile, "Do you have any courses suitable for children?"

She pointed at Ludwig, causing him to tremble and turn pale.

This made Jenna feel the obvious digestion of the Affliction potion.

Danitz's eyes lit up, and he said with a big smile, "Of course we do!
From foreign language education and logic courses for 3-year-olds to
vocational training for adults, we have it all!"

As he spoke, his gaze couldn't help but move back and forth between
Jenna and Franca's faces a few times, seemingly stunned by their beauty.

Many celebrities with makeup and photo editing might not be this
beautiful!

Jenna took the flier and looked at it carefully, then said with a smile,
"When we have time, I'll bring the child to take a look."

She kept in mind the plan Lumian had made, focusing on observation for
now and not rushing to make contact.

Hearing Jenna's words, Ludwig's face showed obvious bitterness. He could
only grab a handful of grilled beef skewers and fiercely tear off more
than a dozen pieces of meat sprinkled with chili powder and cumin to
soothe his inner wounds.

"Alright, remember to mention my name for a discount!" Danitz marveled
at how such a young beauty already had such a big child, assuming she
must have not studied well in high school and was taken home by some
hooligan to have a child before finishing school. He then gave his name,
"My surname is Da, and my given name is Nizi."

After saying this, his gaze lingered on Jenna and Franca's faces before
he unhesitatingly turned around to continue looking for targets to
distribute fliers.

"He should be a fake person in the dream woven by Mr. Fool's
subconscious." Anthony, who had been observing silently, made his
judgment.

Lumian nodded, then added, "Indeed, he didn't show any special qualities
an Oracle should have, and he obviously didn't recognize me."

At this point, Lumian smiled. "Since he's woven by Mr. Fool's
subconscious, it shows that in Mr. Fool's perception, the Oracle is
someone who likes women but won't be confused by them, with relatively
strong willpower in this aspect."

This conclusion was drawn from Danitz's behavior of being attracted by
the beauty of the two Demonesses yet not flirting, not lingering, and
not talking too much.

"It might not be strong willpower, but professional ethics that prevent
him from flirting with women while working, or he might have someone he
likes and is willing to restrain himself for," Franca said, eventually
showing an ambiguous smile. "Does this mean what's written in the
Adventurer series is true?"

"The rumors at sea say the same," Lumian confirmed Franca's guess.

In the time that followed, the four of them mainly observed and didn't
eat much, while Ludwig turned his grief into appetite, eventually
causing them to spend 400.

Franca put the last piece of grilled eggplant into her mouth, chewed a
few times, and stood up somewhat reluctantly, saying, "It's time to go
back."

This was truly a nostalgic taste.

As they circled back to their own neighborhood, Jenna glanced at the
bright street lamps on both sides, then at the pedestrians walking in
the summer night breeze in the dark night. She had the illusion that it
wasn't near dawn now, but just the beginning of the night.

In Trier, before becoming a Beyonder, she only dared to walk on the
streets at midnight relying on her reputation as the Red Boots' mistress
and her concealed revolver. Even so, she didn't dare to walk too far
home and usually had to stay at Franca's place. But in this metropolis
in Mr. Fool's dream, people seemed accustomed to enjoying the deep night
on the streets.

Franca had already integrated into such an environment, as if returning
to her past life.

She was looking around quite comfortably when she suddenly noticed a
human figure hanging on the outer wall of a building at the edge of an
alley leading to an old neighborhood, gently swaying in a place where
the street lamps couldn't illuminate.

With a Demoness's super vision and Night Vision, Franca instantly saw
the appearance of that figure clearly:

Yellowish eyebrows, hair of the same color, a red headband wrapped
around the forehead, deep blue eyes bulging out, frozen in pain and
despair, not very deep facial features already distorted, mouth
half-open, tongue sticking out.

Danitz!

Oracle Danitz!

He was hanging on the outer wall of the building, with a brownish-yellow
hemp rope around his neck!

He had been hanged.

The man who was distributing tutoring fliers to Lumian and the others
just over an hour ago had been hanged!

As Franca's pupils suddenly dilated, Lumian and Jenna also noticed the
corpse hanging in mid-air, gently swaying.

"The Oracle is dead? Murdered?" Jenna blurted out in confusion.

*Who did this?*

*Was it a natural development of the dream, or was it done by that
Celestial Worthy's subordinates?*

After confirming that the corpse was indeed Oracle Danitz, Franca
exhaled and said, "It's good that he's just a fake person in the dream,
so the Oracle in reality won't die along with him."

Hearing these words, Lumian's heart stirred. He walked into the alley
and came to the front of Danitz's suspended corpse.

During the process, he continuously observed his surroundings and took
out a mirror to perform a quick and simple divination to confirm whether
the murderer had already left and if anyone was paying attention to this
place.

Before he got really close, he could already smell the stench of loss of
bowel and bladder control.

Combined with other details, he determined that the Oracle had indeed
been hanged to death.

Lumian condensed ice blocks on the wall to create protrusions, then
nimbly climbed up to reach the same height as Danitz's corpse. He then
put the Oracle, along with the hemp rope, into the mirror he had just
used for divination.

"You want to bury the Oracle?" Franca asked curiously after Lumian
jumped down from the wall, melted all the ice blocks, and dried the wet
marks with crimson flames.

Lumian looked around and said in a lowered voice, "To conduct an
experiment."

"What experiment?" Jenna, holding the depressed Ludwig's hand, asked
curiously.

Lumian chuckled. "Based on the contents of the information and the
details we've observed so far, we all know that this dream evolved from
Mr. Fool's subconscious. If we hide the Oracle's corpse and don't let
Mr. Fool discover or hear about such an incident, does that mean the
Oracle's death doesn't exist, and tomorrow night, the Oracle will still
be distributing fliers in that area with many night food stalls?"

"Come to think of it, it's really possible!" Franca quickly recalled the
dream-themed movies and novels she had seen before her transmigration.

"If that's the case, we can find ways to use this point: major events
that Mr. Fool's dream identity doesn't know about or hasn't heard of are
equivalent to non-existent, never having happened!" Lumian said with a
smile.

"But what if the Oracle doesn't appear tomorrow night, or if the police
have obtained information about his disappearance?" Jenna knew Lumian
wouldn't have overlooked this question, after all, there were only two
possible outcomes for the experiment.

Lumian said with a smile on his lips, "There might be two reasons:

"First, each fake person in the dream, besides coming from Mr. Fool's
memories and cognition, also has his subconscious integrated into them,
so any event that happens in the dream will be known and recorded by Mr.
Fool's subconscious."

Seeing that Franca and the others seemed unable to grasp the point he
wanted to make, Lumian gave an example: "The information mentions that
Mr. Fool was an ancient existence awakening from slumber, collecting
power and secrets through his incarnation walking on earth, gradually
reviving. His incarnation experienced the advancement from Sequence 2
Miracle Invoker to Sequence 1 Attendant of Mysteries. To prepare for the
ritual, he established a town called Utopia, where every resident was
Mr. Fool's marionette. Each marionette had its own destiny trajectory,
all played by Mr. Fool, interacting with each other, portraying reality.

"Isn't this very similar to the current real dream? Except for the
consciousness projections from the outside, the remaining dream fake
people are likely Mr. Fool's subdivided subconscious, combined with the
images from his memories to portray.

"In other words, except for us, every person and every animal in the
dream might be Mr. Fool. If we really want to contact Mr. Fool, we might
not need to find his dream identity. This could be one of our approaches
to contact Mr. Fool in the future while bypassing the Celestial Worthy's
monitoring."

"Was Utopia mentioned in that information?" Franca was stunned for a
moment.

*Did Mr. Fool use this term?*

She raised her hand to rub her head, showing slight pain and confusion.

"It might have been there, but by the time I reached the later parts, I
was already dazed. I seemed to be communicating with you, but I actually
had no idea what I was saying..."

"It was indeed there, and the approach I just mentioned wasn't thought
up by me either, it was proposed by the Major Arcana card holders, but
they no longer have the chance to verify it." Lumian nodded.

"Everyone is Mr. Fool..." Jenna recalled the sea of people they
encountered after leaving the train carriage and the bustling scenes
they had seen before, finding it hard to believe for a moment.

Lumian continued, "As for the second reason, if the Oracle's death was
carried out by the Celestial Worthy's subordinates, that Celestial
Worthy can also control and influence the dream, and would certainly let
Mr. Fool's subconscious know about this incident. But the question is,
what's the point of dealing with such a fake person?

"Even if they wanted to shake Mr. Fool's will by targeting his emotional
weak points, they shouldn't have chosen the Oracle. From the
information, the Oracle hasn't established any close relationship with
Mr. Fool in the dream, not even qualifying as a friend."

"Strange," Franca murmured in agreement.

They quickly dealt with the scene using the Demoness's black flames,
left the alley, and walked towards the old neighborhood where they were
renting.

As they approached the main gate, they suddenly heard someone
frantically calling out in a low voice from the side near some green
trees, "Spare me, please spare me...

"Don't come any closer, don't come any closer!"

Lumian turned his gaze towards the source and saw that it was a local
man, not someone with Northern Continent facial features like Oracle
Danitz.
