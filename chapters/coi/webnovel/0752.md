## Chapter 752: In the Darkness

*Dammit!*

Though Lumian had toyed with the idea of taking risks, he hadn't truly
made up his mind. The sudden extinguishing of his white candle prompted
him to swear under his breath, instinctively preparing to activate the
black mark on his shoulder and teleport out of the catacombs.

At that moment, a bone-chilling cold tinged with slight pain surged
through the palm of his right hand.

This snap of pain brought him to his senses, thankfully without any
further unpleasant changes to his body.

*Indeed...* Lumian instantly calmed down, abandoning the idea of
using his Spirit World Traversal ability.

His suspicions were confirmed!

He clenched his right hand discreetly, ensuring the prominently-marked
Underworld Daoist seal wasn't visible to anything lurking in the
darkness.

After the elderly, decaying, and clearly unwell catacombs administrator
mistook him for a kindred spirit, Lumian suspected it was due to the
Underworld Daoist seal.

Given that the Samaritan Women's Spring was closely related to the
Underworld Daoist and the catacombs of Trier were likely built to
contain its overflowing influence, the administrators took turns
guarding the massive tomb chamber leading to the spring.

Since catacombs administrators affected by anomalies could navigate the
dark catacombs without a lit white candle and not disappear,
theoretically, he should be able to as well, given his Underworld Daoist
seal!

Of course, this was extremely risky. A wrong guess could mean dying
without leaving a trace, causing Lumian to hesitate despite his wild
impulse.

In the pure darkness, where his eyes saw nothing, Lumian felt as if he
were in Trier's subterranean river, immersed in cold, damp, heavy, and
silent waters.

Yet, he breathed easily; his body and soul strangely drawing air from
the dense, dark "waters," sustaining his existence.

He seemed like a fish in the deep sea.

The darkness, like flowing water, layered and pressed down, isolating
this space from the surrounding areas and the outside world.

The next moment, Lumian heard the old administrator's raspy, indifferent
voice.

"Recently, three people tried to approach the spring, but I stopped
them."

*Three people...* Lumian's spirit lifted as he asked, "Who were
they?"

"One time it was a Blessed of darkness and death with a Hunter," the old
administrator described in his own way.

*A Blessed of darkness and death with a Hunter... Isn't that Madame Hela
and me? You still remember us...* Lumian realized, followed by
muttered criticisms.

He had thought this elderly administrator, unlike the more active ones
like Kendall and nearing a corpse-like state, didn't recognize people by
sight but by sensing their presence---Lumian had encountered two
catacombs administrators guiding visitors when he arrived at the
Entrance to the Old Ossuary, and they didn't see him as one of their
own. Instead, they advised him not to wander alone and always keep a
white candle burning for light.

"Who was the third?" Lumian pressed on.

*Was it Harrison, or Monette, the incarnation of Amon active in these
subterranean catacombs?*

The old catacombs administrator responded in a monotone, husky voice,
"An outsider, he felt similar to us but also different, so I stopped
him."

*Similar yet different... an outsider...* Lumian pondered these
key descriptions and surmised it was probably Harrison from Resurrection
Island!

"What did he look like?" Lumian asked, controlling his emotions,
seemingly calm.

He couldn't see through the darkness, not even the outline of the old
administrator, but he sensed the other was right in front of him, no
more than two meters away.

He then heard the old administrator reply: "I've been an administrator
for so long, I've forgotten many things. Even death itself vanishes
here, let alone our memories. I can't remember what he looked like, only
that he didn't resemble an Intisian, nor a Loenese or Feysacian."

After a brief pause, the catacombs administrator continued in his flat
tone, "I should go back to rest now..."

Lumian did not try to stop him, nor did he ask further questions.

Although he hadn't heard any footsteps, nor sensed any movement ahead, a
very clear thought suddenly struck him: *The person has already
left.*

*He didn't look like an Intisian, a Loenese, or a Feysacian... An
outsider... Someone who had been to the fourth level of the catacombs in
recent months...* Lumian replayed the catacombs administrator's
responses in his mind over and over.

Suddenly, he remembered something: *Franca had mentioned that she
encountered a man in the catacombs who she suspected came from the world
of the Celestial Master---the world they had transmigrated from. Her
judgment was based on the man's appearance, which closely resembled the
people from that world and was distinctly different from those of the
Intisians, Loenese, Feynapotterians, and Feysacians!*

*So, the person Franca met was the one the elderly administrator
persuaded to leave? And that person could very well be Harrison from
Resurrection Island...*

*Is Resurrection Island actually a node where two worlds
converge?*

*The reason the nautical chart leading to Resurrection Island is
incorrect is because it lacks mystical details; even if one reaches the
designated sea area, only danger is encountered, with no sight of the
goal?*

*This would nicely explain Franca's divination result that the "chart is
genuine" and why adventurers have failed to locate Resurrection Island.
The charts are indeed accurate, but they don't record the method to open
the "Island's Door"!*

*If this is the case, there should be a deeper explanation for why
Franca and the others were transmigrated, and for the purpose of the
Resurrection Islanders appearing on the North and South
Continents...*

*The good thing now is, Franca has seen someone who might be Harrison
and has drawn a corresponding portrait through a ritual, which will help
us in our future search.*

*Heh heh, Franca and Jenna's exploration yielded quite a lot of crucial
information about many important matters, filled with a sense of being
arranged.*

*This might not have been that entity's doing, but it's highly likely
related to Monette, who often haunts this place...*

Lumian was particularly puzzled about why the True Creator or Amon
valued this matter so much. Their previous "help" was mainly about
combating the evil gods beyond the barrier and didn't involve issues
from another world.

*Hmm, would that Celestial Worthy be counted as one of the evil gods
beyond the barrier?*

*Does He come from the Celestial Master's world?*

*Is this also considered a part of the evil gods' invasion?"*

Lumian speculated briefly before pondering another question: Whether to
inform Franca, 007, Madame Hela, and other members of the Curly-Haired
Baboons Research Society about this.

Lumian could already picture what would happen: Including Franca, some
members of the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society would desperately
set out to sea, searching for Resurrection Island marked on the sea
chart, failing to find the island, but finding it being even more
dangerous!

But Lumian preferred to see Franca remain as she was: conflicted about
her gender but generally happy.

After a moment of silence, Lumian laughed a bit out of character,
whispering self-mockingly in the environment like the dark depths of the
sea, "Would you avoid seeking a way to resurrect Aurore because of
danger and others' expectations?

"Would you give up resisting because of danger and others' expectations?

"Would you refuse to merge with the bloodline of Omebella because of
danger and others' expectations?

"No!"

Lumian made up his mind and began to focus on his surroundings.

He couldn't see anything but faintly sensed figures wandering in the
darkness, felt hands reaching out to him, grabbing his arms, ankles,
neck, and body, yet not having any tangible effect.

No, there was one thing---Lumian felt distinctly colder, to the point
where, with the physical traits of a Reaper, he almost couldn't help but
constrict his pores and shiver lightly.

He also heard faint, painful, despairing cries but couldn't discern
their specific directions.

*Are these the people who vanished in the catacombs before?*
Lumian tried to listen closely, to find one or two of the missing, to
understand their current state, but it was to no avail.

Suddenly, he shivered.

The cold and the dead silence seeped into his mind.

His thoughts became slightly sluggish, and his memories of certain
things grew a bit fuzzy.

*The Underworld Daoist*'s* seal just prevents me from
disappearing on the spot, from even dying without a trace, but it can't
stop me from being slowly eroded by the abnormalities here, like those
catacombs administrators? And, my erosion is clearly faster than
theirs...* Lumian snapped a flame into existence, lighting the
white candle in his hand.

The darkness, cold, weight, silence, and dampness retreated as the light
spread.

Lumian glanced at the candle in his hand, nodding and muttering to
himself, "I just interpreted the Underworld Daoist's seal as a kind of
alternative white candlelight, but now it seems, they're not the same,
fundamentally different. One stems from an anomaly being sealed, the
other leverages the power sealing this place?"

As thoughts swirled, Lumian, holding the burning white candle, made his
way back along the original route.

Upon returning to the Entrance of the Old Ossuary, he saw that the few
university students who had been there were gone.

"Scared off, just like that?" Lumian scoffed softly, leisurely leaving
the catacombs and returning to Place du Purgatoire.

In the Quartier de la Cathédrale Commémorative, Apartment 702 on 9 Rue
Orosai.

Franca, who was about to go out to gather information on the Mirror
People, saw Lumian again.

"You're here again? It's the third time today!" the Demoness of Pleasure
asked, her lips twitching slightly.
