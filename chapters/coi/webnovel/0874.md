## Chapter 874: Unsealing

After a while, Voisin Sanson stopped passively waiting for the fate
exchange to complete and began actively using various strange abilities,
suppressing Lumian's attacks.

On the other side, Harrison increasingly relied on his Paper Figurine
Substitutes to avoid the mystical plague spreading through the ruins of
the town.

He had little time left to interfere with Lumian and kept trying to
remove the densely packed mythical pathogens in the air with various
methods he could think of, but to little avail.

Lumian felt the fate exchange nearing completion. Although he wasn't
afraid, he decided to take a gamble.

Mimicking the Beyonders of the Warrior pathway, he unleashed a Hurricane
of Light, holding the Sword of Courage upside down and stabbing it
forcefully into the ground.

With him and the Sword of Courage at the center, blazing white-blue
fireballs spread layer upon layer, covering the ruins of the town.

*Rumble!*

Explosions erupted one after another, destroying the already crumbling
ancient buildings and igniting every corner of the ruins.

Harrison used his Paper Figurine Substitute again. As he was always on
the edge of the town ruins, his figure reappeared in the dark tunnel
they had pursued through earlier.

Voisin Sanson, who was closer to Lumian, was inevitably affected. His
attempt to teleport was interrupted by the violent shockwave.

His body caught fire again, but the injuries were not fatal. With the
resilience of an Ascetic, he only instinctively twisted his face in
pain.

Seizing this opportunity, Lumian teleported in front of Voisin Sanson.

Voisin Sanson's eyes immediately filled with ghostly green light.

Almost simultaneously, Lumian, anticipating Voisin Sanson's habit and
method of using the terrifying beam, half-turned the Sword of Courage,
holding it horizontally in front of his chest.

The ghostly green beam, upon completion, shot towards Lumian at
unavoidable speed, striking the Sword of Courage. The blazing white-blue
flames on its iron-black blade were instantly extinguished, and its
metallic luster dimmed significantly.

Successfully blocking Voisin Sanson's beam, Lumian released his left
hand, aiming to deliver a fatal blow.

He sensed that Voisin Sanson's current Circle Inhabitant cycle was
nearing its end. Perhaps two or three more triggers would lead to the
inevitable conclusion, possibly even death.

At this moment, Lumian's hair stood on end, his mind nearly blank.

The negative effects of the Black Tear forehead accessory manifested.

If not for the Sword of Courage sharing the burden, he would have been
utterly overwhelmed by Pleasure, rather than just briefly dazed.

Taking advantage of this moment of distraction, Voisin Sanson teleported
away from the emptied ruins but did not extend the distance beyond the
Fate Exchange limit.

Lumian quickly regained his senses and prepared to pursue Voisin Sanson.

Suddenly, his thoughts slowed, becoming sluggish as if he had been
rapidly frozen.

His body became rigid, and even moving a finger was extremely difficult.

The fate exchange had completed.

*Clang!* The Sword of Courage fell to the ground, as Lumian no
longer had the strength to hold it.

Lumian slowly collapsed to the ground, his eyes vacant, his expression
blank, leaning against a pile of rubble.

No longer controlled by Courage, he instinctively tried to activate the
Blood Emperor's residual mark on his right palm, hoping the rampant
frenzy might help him break free from his current state, but he couldn't
manage it.

His ability to think coherently was rapidly slipping away.

This was the outcome Voisin Sanson had wanted from the Fate Exchange.

Voisin Sanson smiled, teleporting back to Lumian, and whispered, "If not
for your false Angel rank, the fate exchange would have been completed
long ago.

"You probably don't know that the maximum limit for the Circle
Inhabitant's cycles is nine. You're still several cycles short of
dealing real damage to me.

"You're not truly a demigod. There's a fundamental difference between
you and someone with godhood."

As Voisin Sanson spoke, he pulled out an incomplete ritual sheepskin,
just large enough to cover a head, intending to turn Lumian into a sheep
and completely control him.

In the next second, Lumian felt the stiffness in his body and the
sluggishness of his thoughts easing, their effects seemingly distorted.

Opportunity! Lumian immediately tried to activate the black mark on his
right shoulder, hoping to teleport out of the special mirror world.

Voisin Sanson's face changed, then he activated a contract mark,
shouting in a deep voice, "Lumian Lee!"

As Lumian's figure was still fading away, his mind buzzed, his head
spinning, making it difficult to maintain the teleportation effect.

Voisin Sanson then placed the sheepskin over Lumian's head, chanting in
Hermes, "Sheep!"

A flash of dark light transformed Lumian into a grayish-white sheep.

Most of his abilities were sealed, and the earlier state of sluggish
thoughts and stiff body returned, preventing him from using the Black
Tear forehead accessory or the Devil's Whispers bone ring.

Seeing this, Voisin Sanson felt the weakness and spirituality exhaustion
in his own body but believed he could endure the mystical plague for a
while longer, waiting for the Circle Inhabitant effect to passively
activate.

A sinister paper figurine with drawn features entered the still-burning
ruins from the tunnel, its surface accumulating rust at a visible rate.

It looked at Lumian and spoke in Harrison's voice, "Your companions
don't seem to have escaped either."

As he spoke, the paper figurine made a gesture, and the edges of the
dark world illuminated by the flames began to turn transparent,
revealing the states of Franca and the others---not through Harrison's
magic, but through the Mirror People watching in the shadows.

In the mirror-like scene, Franca led the others, except Ludwig, trying
to traverse out of the special mirror world.

Above them, a figure in a black dress and gold crown appeared.

Surrounded by white mist, a light seemed to emanate from in front of
her.

She glanced down, causing Franca and the others to fall back into the
area they had just left, unable to escape the special mirror world.

Higdon, having split into two and covered in green-yellow slime, blocked
Franca and the others' escape route in the scene.

After using it three more times, Franca's Ice Talisman only had one
Mirror Traversal left.

She did not attempt to flee again. She pulled out a set of silver-white
full-body armor from the Traveler's Bag and placed it in front of
herself. Anthony also drew the Winter is Coming revolver.

In another scene, another Higdon was searching for Ludwig.

Seeing this, the increasingly ragged paper figurine of Harrison spoke to
Lumian with a laugh,

"Your companions will likely all die before you. Their Mirror
Substitutes aren't as numerous as my paper figurines. You still have
time to mourn them.

"Actually, you've done quite well. If it weren't for me and Higdon, your
team might have been able to escape or even win against Voisin Sanson on
their own."

With double control over him, Lumian had almost no ability to think
deeply, leaving only his emotions to resonate.

His heart was ablaze with anger, indignation, and hatred, filling the
sheep's eyes with bloodshot rage.

Voisin Sanson turned to Harrison's paper figurine and asked, "Can I kill
him now to bring back Lord Termiboros?"

Harrison's paper figurine shook its head slowly, "The Celestial Worthy's
revelation is to imprison."

Voisin Sanson thought for a moment and said, "Indeed, killing this trash
might trigger unforeseen changes due to the high-level powers within
him, potentially affecting the entire Project Vortex.

"Can I attempt to unseal his chest and bring back Lord Termiboros?"

Harrison's paper figurine paused for two seconds and said, "Yes."

This did not violate the Celestial Worthy's revelation.

Voisin Sanson smiled and said, "I'll need you to use that Celestial
Worthy's boon for the final part. Otherwise, I'd have to bring Lumian
Lee to the brink of death to unseal him, which is too risky."

The method to unseal Lumian Lee's The Fool seal wasn't devised by Voisin
Sanson himself but given through a ritual by the great Circle of
Inevitability.

"Okay." Harrison agreed.

Voisin Sanson immediately took out a black metal box and opened it.

Inside were thumb-sized mercury beads, their surfaces tinged with black
and inscribed with complex, fear-inducing patterns and symbols.

Voisin Sanson's voice became low and his words eerily ethereal.

The black-tinged mercury beads floated up, spinning rapidly in mid-air,
forming a continuous river.

With barely any coherent thoughts, Lumian heard Voisin Sanson and
Harrison's conversation and saw the scene unfold but felt no despair or
regret.

At this point, despair and regret were meaningless.

Lumian was only filled with anger, indignation, and hatred. The sheep's
eyes bulged with fury.

*Son of a sow!*

Within ten to twenty seconds, Voisin Sanson completed his chant, sending
the silver-black river towards Lumian's chest.

In the tunnel, Harrison had lit four candles and placed four pieces of
bread in front of each, reciting incantations while taking special
footsteps and gestures.

Lumian quickly fell into a dark state, his thoughts gradually clearing.

But before he could form any other thoughts, his chest grew hot, the
familiar heat rapidly dissipating, turning cold.

In an instant, silver-black light beams burst from his body, weaving
together in front of him to form a figure.
