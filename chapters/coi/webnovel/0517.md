## Chapter 517: Prominent Merchant

Lumian ignored the stunned silence that followed his question. A smirk
played on his lips as he addressed the group,

"So, where can a fellow find some mystical trinkets around here?"

Upon hearing this question, Batna Comté couldn't help but raise his
right hand and finish his remaining Golden Somme.

Where did this punk come from?

How could he ask such a question in public?

Even if nobody reported him, they'd only see him as a fool!

For a moment, Batna regretted accepting Louis Berry's invitation. This
fellow would tarnish his reputation by association.

Noticing the odd expressions around the bar, Lumian gave a nonchalant
shrug. He holstered his revolver and announced,

"Looks like you're all just ordinary folk, then."

With that, he leaped off the wooden platform, navigating through the
startled crowd back to the counter.

The two drunkards he'd thrown out, along with the others who had been
frightened by him, measured his strength and weapons, choosing not to
retaliate.

Back on his barstool, Lumian ordered a Lanti Proof with a grin at Batna.

"Port Farim is certainly more open than Trier."

Batna studied Louis Berry with an "are you serious?" expression, forcing
a smile.

"We must follow Gehrman Sparrow's career, not his actions."

Is this fellow so obsessed with Gehrman Sparrow that he mimics his cold,
reckless demeanor?

Gehrman Sparrow, at least, had the strength to back up his madness. What
about you?

Furthermore, Gehrman Sparrow exudes a cold and indifferent madness,
while you are reckless, foolish, and brainless. How can the two be
equal?

Lumian ignored Batna's jab and turned the conversation to the recent
surge in pirate activity in the Fog Sea.

After finishing his Lanti Proof, he bid farewell to Batna and headed
out. Walking through the bustling open-air market, he made his way
towards the harbor.

Just as Lumian returned to the square plastered with announcements, a
sudden jolt sent him whirling around.

A male Islander, sporting a half-top hat and a dusty black jacket,
approached hesitantly, a strained smile plastered on his face.

"I saw you at the bar earlier."

"Cut to the chase," Lumian urged impatiently.

The Islander, his brownish-black skin stretched over a lean face, leaned
in and lowered his voice.

"Looking for mystical items, are we? I know just the place."

"Really?" Lumian asked in disbelief.

"Can't promise anything, but it's worth a shot. Just don't buy anything
if they turn out unsuitable." The Islander's gaze flicked to Lumian's
left armpit. "Besides, you're armed and dangerous. Not exactly an easy
target for robbery, right?"

"That's true." Lumian contemplated this for a moment, then gave a slow
nod. "What's your name?"

"Carmel." The Islander gestured towards a narrow street branching off
the square. "Follow me. It's close."

Lumian trailed nonchalantly behind Carmel, their path crossing two
streets before they arrived in a district eerily reminiscent of Rue
Anarchie.

Crumbling buildings huddled close, new construction jostling for space
amidst the narrow road.

Carmel led Lumian into a dimly lit laundry shop, its interior draped
with damp clothes. They navigated the maze of hanging garments, arriving
finally deep inside the dark room.

There was a door there.

"Disguise yourself first," Carmel instructed, retrieving two hooded
black robes from a hook nearby. "Those who dabble in such things prefer
to keep their identities secret."

Lumian donned the robe, pulling the hood low over his face. Carmel then
rapped on the door in a specific rhythm.

It creaked open, revealing a makeshift living room furnished with an old
sofa, threadbare armchairs, and a mismatched assortment of furniture.

Six figures, cloaked in identical robes, sat in various positions, their
faces obscured by the shadows.

Lumian politely closed the door behind him as Carmel made a brief
introduction.

After the two pulled up a stool and sat down, a man with his hood pulled
low leaned forward and whispered,

"I need a Royal Jellyfish's venom crystal. I can offer 5,000 verl d'or."

Silence.

The next participant sold a Strange Sea Eagle eyeball he had procured.

Seeing that their discussion was on point, Lumian stood up and surveyed
the gathering.

"I need a Sphinx's brain. Name your price."

The man seeking the Crown Jellyfish's venom crystal's voice was
carefully controlled as he replied, "I happen to have one. If you pay me
30,000 verl d'or, it's yours."

"How can I be sure of its authenticity?" Lumian asked him directly.

The Strange Sea Eagle eyeball seller interjected in a raspy voice, "I
can notarize it for you."

"Excellent. Let me take a look at the goods first," Lumian smiled,
approaching the seller.

The man replied calmly, "Such a valuable mystical item, you wouldn't
expect me to carry it around, would you?

"I'll only bring it to you if you pay a 50% deposit first. It's
upstairs. You can follow me and make sure I don't escape. You can even
put the deposit with the Notary for safekeeping."

"Very reasonable." Just as Lumian finished speaking, he suddenly lunged
at the trader with the speed of a cheetah, a right hook swinging through
the air.

*Bang!*

The man crumpled to the ground, his teeth flying in a spray of blood.

The other participants, including the Notary and Carmel, were
momentarily stunned before scrambling for the door.

None of them challenged Lumian's assault, nor attempted to use their
powers. Their sole focus was on escape.

Carmel, closest to the exit, flung open the door and bolted.

In an instant, his vision blurred, and he found himself back in the
simple living room, alongside two others who had suffered the same fate.

They all looked bewildered, as if witnessing a folktale come alive.

*Bang!*

A yellow bullet slammed into the exit door.

The hooded figures huddled down, covering their heads with practiced
movements.

Lumian spun around, pulled back the trader's hood, and pressed the
revolver's muzzle against his forehead.

"Not a bad scam," Lumian said with a smile.

He had orchestrated an impromptu conspiracy, drawing attention with a
gunshot in the bar and publicly expressing his need for a mystical item.
This allowed him to identify any greedy pirates or local swindlers who
might possess knowledge beyond the reach of ordinary citizens, including
black market information.

It was also a way to digest the potion.

The seller was a typical Islander, with brownish-black skin, a long
face, gentle features, and dark amber eyes.

"I wasn't lying to you!" he insisted anxiously and angrily.

"Really?" Lumian cocked the revolver's hammer.

Before closing the door, Lumian had created a Bottle of Fiction, setting
a condition that only Beyonders could enter.

None of the participants had successfully "escaped," which confirmed the
absence of Beyonders.

If you're not a Beyonder, why mention the main ingredient of the
Conspirer potion? Just for fun?

The seller trembled and stammered, "I-I'm sorry. We just wanted to scam
some money. We-we can't survive otherwise!"

Lumian wasn't interested in their motives. He glanced at the neatly
lined-up accomplices and tapped the trader's forehead with the gun's
muzzle.

"What's your name?"

"Roddy," the seller replied, swallowing hard.

Another tap to the forehead.

"Where did you hear about the Sphinx brain, Crown Jellyfish's venom
crystal, and Notary?"

This information was inaccessible to ordinary people.

"I-I can't say." A sheen of cold sweat appeared on Roddy's forehead.

Confidentiality agreement or other restrictions? Lumian studied Roddy
for a few seconds and smiled.

"Then tell me who your master is."

Roddy froze, his eyes widening in fear.

He hadn't expected the other party to be so certain he had a master,
that he was someone else's servant.

"Three, two..." Lumian began the countdown.

"It's Sir Morgalla," Roddy blurted out.

"Then take me there," Lumian calmly requested.

Roddy's sweating intensified.

"No, no, I'm Monsieur Fidel's attendant.

"He's the vice president of the Port Farim Joint Chamber of Commerce."

*Participating in numerous mysticism gatherings organized by Fidel as an
attendant? Although he can't divulge the corresponding information to
others, he can use the information he obtained to swindle
adventurers?* Lumian stood up thoughtfully, dismantled the
Bottle of Fiction, and led Carmel and his swindler accomplices out. He
interrogated them one by one and confirmed that Roddy was indeed Fidel
Guerra's attendant.

One of the vice president of the Port Farim Joint Chamber of Commerce's
primary tasks was to assist pirates in handling sensitive and illegal
cargo.

†

Port Farim, Quartier des Black Pearls, Governor-General's Office, 16 Rue
Coreas.

Lumian patted Roddy, now donned in his red attendant's attire with gold
trimmings and crisp white pants. A smile played on Lumian's lips as he
spoke.

"Tell Monsieur Fidel that I'm interested in purchasing some mystical
ingredients and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss it further."

"Alright." Roddy yearned to utter a single plea: "If you could kindly
remove the revolver from my back, I would be eternally grateful."

Leaning against the weathered wall of a nearby house, Lumian watched as
the swindler nervously entered Unit 16, the four-story gray-roofed
building adorned with numerous statues.

The moment Roddy stepped inside, escaping the revolver's direct aim, his
first instinct was to bury the whole incident and forget it ever
happened.

But then he remembered the chilling warning delivered by the man who
fired without hesitation: a ten-minute silence from Fidel, and Roddy's
true colors as a swindler would be painted loudly across the street.

*Should I lie and claim Monsieur Fidel is unavailable? But he doesn't
seem easily duped. A drastic reaction could be worse...* Roddy,
caught in a dilemma, clenched his teeth and rapped on the study door.

Fidel Guerra, a man descended from both Intis and Feynapotter blood,
possessed curly black hair that had started to show signs of age, dark
brown eyes, and skin darkened by the sun. Though once known for his
refined demeanor, time had etched its mark on his face, leaving behind a
mane of mottled white hair and prominent wrinkles.

Dressed in a crisp white shirt and a brown vest, he quietly sipped his
wine as Roddy, trembling with fear, stammered out their confession. He
spoke of their ill intentions, of their attempt to swindle the new
adventurer.

As soon as Roddy mentioned Lumian leaping onto the wooden platform,
firing a shot to attract attention, and boldly inquiring about obtaining
a mystical item, the merchant sighed and interrupted his flustered
attendant.

"There's no need to elaborate further. Does he wish to see me now?"
