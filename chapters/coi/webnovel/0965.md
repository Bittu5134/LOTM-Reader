## Chapter 965: Experimenting Again

Lumian hid behind a mirror-like object on the corridor wall, gazing at
Li Keji's hospital room through the hard barrier.

He had maintained this position for many hours, only occasionally
adjusting to relax.

He had waited all night but hadn't seen Zaratulstra or other
subordinates of the Celestial Worthy come to eliminate Li Keji.

After an unknown amount of time, as sunlight shone in from the other end
of the corridor, different rooms in the psychiatric ward gradually
became lively. Someone was singing loudly, someone was banging on doors,
someone was knocking on something unknown, as if calling for breakfast.

At this moment, Lumian saw a large amount of milky white liquid surge
out from the gap between Li Keji's hospital room door and the solid
floor.

*Milk?* Lumian's gaze froze slightly.

A second later, he found that the milky white liquid, which seemed to be
milk, receded like a tide back into Li Keji's hospital room. The floor
became clean again, with only varying degrees of wet traces remaining.

Lumian watched silently.

A few minutes later, with his eagle-like vision, he felt that there
seemed to be something indescribable at the doorway of the hospital
room.

He carefully pressed his face against the mirror surface, penetrating
out slightly.

The scene before his eyes instantly lost its mirrored feel, becoming
clearer.

He then saw some small, distinct white lines, and noticed finer, less
obvious white filaments around them.

These things as a whole looked like intersecting, much thinner
snowflakes, or as if countless white fuzz were mixed together.

Compared to the spider silk of Demonesses, they were all opaque, tinted
with color, and could still be discovered upon careful observation.

*Mycelium?* Lumian made a guess.

This was based on speculation about Li Keji's own special nature.

After a few seconds, these mycelium uniformly retracted, passing through
the door gap and disappearing into the corridor.

A scene spontaneously emerged in Lumian's mind: a strangely shaped giant
mushroom man, no, a giant mushroom, walking to the door, carefully
extending its mycelium---its goals unknown.

Lumian fell silent once again.

He seriously pondered a question, *Is letting Zaratulstra and other
subordinates of the Celestial Worthy eliminate Li Keji ultimately a bad
thing or a good thing...*

*As long as they are prevented from taking Li Keji's corpse to the
basement of Mushu Hospital and using the Mother's power to give him new
life, the whole thing doesn't seem that unacceptable...*

*Hmm, Frank Lee's mushrooms in the dream city seemed to have overlapped
with Mr. Fool's idealistic cognition, becoming more terrifying and
bizarre than in reality. If they lost control later, who knows which
side it would benefit...*

*No, no, no, fire is also dangerous, but fire can be
exploited...*

*This guy is suitable to be confined in a psychiatric ward, to be
released when needed, or to borrow a few mushrooms with unique
functions...*

*Can a psychiatric ward really contain him? Should he be helped to enter
prison, to be controlled by the officials representing the dream's main
consciousness?*

*But if so, it would be very troublesome for us to utilize him, and
moreover, he doesn't look like someone without mental problems in any
way. Franca had explained before that in the dream city, such mentally
ill patients don't need to go to prison, they just need to receive
prolonged treatment in a mental hospital...*

Lumian withdrew his face, distancing himself from the mirror surface.

At 10 a.m., he saw Huang Jiajia, Bernie Huang, accompanied by a lawyer,
Officer Deng, and a doctor in a white coat enter this ward.

Only then did he feel relieved. He traversed to the rear-view mirror of
a car in the underground parking lot, jumped out, and directly
teleported back to the rented apartment in Xinhong District.

At this time, Anthony was in self-isolation, Ludwig had been taken away
by Jenna, and Lumian casually ate some bread before preparing to lie
down on the bed to catch up on sleep.

Just as he had lain down, he felt his phone vibrate once.

The message was from True Hidden Blade: "Zaratulstra has come to visit
the group again, now on the 16th floor, hasn't come down yet."

*Zaratulstra wasn't affected by the tip-off letter? Does the tip-off
letter need evidence, otherwise the police would have to investigate for
a while, obtain sufficient evidence before they can arrest a foreign
guest? Zaratulstra is still very cautious, and the identity of a foreign
guest is also very clever...* Lumian sat on the bed, pondered
and analyzed for a while before replying to Franca: "No need to
interfere with Zaratulstra's visit, but remind Zhou Mingrui to be
careful through Luo Shan."

*†*

Inside the Administration Department of Intis Group.

Franca sent a message to Luo Shan: "If that guy comes to visit the tech
department later, remember to warn Zhou Mingrui to be careful about
safety.

"No rush for now, what if the enemy chooses to visit other departments
or other subsidiaries? Warning Zhou Mingrui in advance would plunge him
into endless suspicion, guarding against everyone around him, which
would greatly affect his mental state in the long run."

Luo Shan replied with a "nodding cat" emoji.

To their surprise, Mr. Huang didn't bring Zaratulstra down for a tour,
the two stayed on the 16th floor until noon before leaving via the
private elevator.

"Alert lifted, the enemy didn't contact the target, so Luo Shan didn't
give any reminder." Franca reported the situation to Lumian during lunch
break.

Lumian quickly replied: "Then I'll carry out the step of hinting at Zhou
Mingrui about the existence of supernatural powers this afternoon, and
be a bit more aggressive. You, Jenna, and Anthony, from now on, don't
contact me, delete the chat history, even my WeChat and QQ numbers, and
add them back tomorrow afternoon."

"Won't this get mixed up with the results of Anthony's probe of Peng
Deng? If he gets kicked out, we might have trouble distinguishing if
it's Peng Deng's problem or something related to your side." Franca
raised a detailed question.

"It won't, we isolated from each other last night, our experimental
results won't affect each other." Lumian had made preparations
yesterday.

Since Franca's consciousness returned to the body of "Luo Fu", he had
started preparing.

At 4 p.m., Lumian arrived at Intis Group early and enjoyed an early
dinner.

Then, he and Old Xia took over from their colleagues and started
patrolling the floors.

After completing this task, they replaced colleagues who were rushing to
the cafeteria and started monitoring the surveillance.

Lumian seemed to be observing the situation on different floors, but his
attention was entirely on the internal parts of Intis Group, on that
area of the 10th floor.

Finally, he saw Zhou Mingrui leave his workstation, walk out of the tech
department, and head towards the public restroom in the middle of the
corridor.

Lumian stood up abruptly, clutching his stomach and said to Old Xia,
"The food was too spicy just now, I need to go to the bathroom."

Without waiting for Old Xia's response, he left the surveillance room
directly.

Old Xia turned to look at his back and said almost inaudibly, "He's only
been working for a week and already learned to take a shit break?"

In the corridor, Lumian avoided two security personnel coming out of the
elevator area, turned into the stairwell, merged into the shadows, and
quickly went down.

In less than thirty seconds, he reached the 10th floor.

Then, pretending to be checking a problem he had discovered during his
earlier floor patrol, he openly entered the corridor between the
Administration Department and Technology Department, arriving outside
the restroom.

He looked left and right, then quickly walked into the men's side with
small steps.

At this time, Zhou Mingrui was washing his hands at the sink.

Lumian glanced inside the restroom, confirming that no one was at the
urinals, and one of the four stalls seemed to be locked.

Zhou Mingrui turned around and just saw him.

Lumian took out a lighter and smiled.

His thumb repeatedly pressed virtually above the lighter, not touching
it, yet the lighter produced a series of crimson red flames.

Seeing this, Zhou Mingrui, who already had doubts, instantly became
mentally tense.

*Is this supernatural power or some kind of magic trick?*

Lumian stepped back twice, pressing his other hand on the edge of the
men's restroom door frame, quietly activating a black mark on his body.

Bottle of Fiction!

He isolated the area of the sink from the rest of the bathroom and the
space outside.

Lumian looked at Zhou Mingrui, who seemed ready to lash out at any
moment, and smiled slightly. "I've drunk a beverage called 'Hunter'."

*You really do have issues...* Zhou Mingrui's eyes narrowed
imperceptibly, his doubts and worries of many days finally becoming
reality.

Lumian turned his head to glance towards the urinals. "I came to you to
warn you. Be careful of that foreign guest called Zaratulstra."

*Zaratulstra...* Zhou Mingrui had a deep impression of this long
name.

He had once been assigned by Mr. Huang as a technical person to receive
Zaratulstra, and was responsible for being the interpreter and
explainer, but the other party either had a mechanical failure with
their flight or encountered severe weather, so he never managed to
receive him.

Later, he got sick and took leave after listening to a song, missing
Zaratulstra's first visit to the company.

After that, he had seen the group's publicity, knowing what Zaratulstra
looked like from videos and photos.

Reminded by Lumian, Zhou Mingrui suddenly remembered that the old man
standing at the door of the Business English class before Luo Shan
warned him to be careful yesterday seemed to be Zaratulstra.

*Was Luo Shan's warning also pointing to Zaratulstra?*

*How did she know Zaratulstra was visiting Dream Tutoring
Classes?*

*Right, Li Ming was there yesterday...*

*Are Li Ming and Luo Shan in cahoots?*

*Luo Fu joined only one day later than Li Ming...*

As these thoughts flashed through Zhou Mingrui's mind, Lumian offered no
explanation, lifted the Bottle of Fiction, and walked out of the men's
restroom.

Zhou Mingrui looked at his back, suddenly feeling that the hidden
currents around him were much more fierce and exaggerated than he had
imagined.

†

After another round of floor patrol, Lumian stood at the office window,
watching as the last golden-red glow of the sunset was swallowed by
darkness.

Night had officially arrived.

By this time, Luo Shan, Luo Fu, and Zhou Mingrui had all gotten off
work, with the latter having left just a few minutes ago.

Lumian looked at the brightly lit buildings, slightly raising his chin
and curling the corners of his mouth, waiting for the possible "exile".

This time, if he was kicked out of the dream, Zaratulstra probably
wouldn't be spared either.

A one-for-one exchange was worth it!
