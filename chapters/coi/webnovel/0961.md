## Chapter 961: Ideology

Lumian's expression remained unchanged as he looked at Grimm, waiting
for him to continue speaking.

At this moment, the psychiatric ward was very quiet. There were no
patients walking around, no family members coming and going, only the
occasional nurse passing by.

Grimm glanced left and right before saying, "Child of God, this is an
opportunity to impregnate Li Keji. Please do it personally."

*Impregnate Frank Lee? I don't have that ability, I can only impregnate
myself!* Lumian grumbled inwardly, glancing at Grimm as he said,
"You need me for such a small matter?"

Grimm smiled awkwardly. "If I do it, Li Keji would need to carry the
child for a full 40 weeks before giving birth. That would take too long
and couldn't be put to use in the short term. There may be some
mutations soon."

*So you really do have the Beyonder power to impregnate anyone
regardless of gender. Corruption is also a kind of boon, and a source of
power... But why are you so fixated on having Frank Lee give birth? Is
it some kind of symbol, symbolizing that Frank Lee has truly become a
child of the Mother?* Various thoughts flashed through Lumian's
mind.

He suddenly remembered that Frank Lee's dream manifestation, Li Keji,
was a special character---influenced by Mr. Fool's subconscious
perception, he exhibited supernatural aspects in mushroom-related
matters. Moreover, judging from the dried mushroom incident, his
potential stance leaned towards Mr. Fool.

If Frank Lee really became a child of the Great Mother, it would mean
that the Great Mother's forces had control over this special point in
the dream city, could effectively utilize it, and more deeply interfere
with the development of the dream.

Although these evil gods like the Great Mother wanted balance more,
Frank Lee falling into their hands was better than being controlled by
the Celestial Worthy. But they also had to guard against the possibility
that they were cooperating with the Celestial Worthy on this matter.

*Frank Lee was arrested by official forces and brought to the
psychiatric ward of Mushu Hospital, representing the will of the
Celestial Worthy. The Great Mother was one of the "major shareholders"
of Mushu Hospital. Perhaps the two have already reached an agreement to
cooperate on this individual incident and completed a private
transaction...* Lumian calmly said to Grimm, "My power is also
limited in this city, not much better than yours."

Grimm explained with a smile, "I know. This time we just want to use
your godhood. Although it's also restricted, it's still godhood.

"After you impregnate Li Keji, the hospital's obstetrics department will
provide the corresponding reproductive technology and Beyonder power
support. Li Keji can give birth to the child within four weeks."

*As expected... The obstetrics department of Mushu Hospital is one of
the symbols of the Great Mother in this dream... It sounds like it has
already been corrupted to some extent, with multiple medical staff
becoming children of the Mother...*

*If the obstetrics departments of every hospital in the dream city are
thoroughly corrupted over time, and the problem isn't exposed, wouldn't
that mean that all newborns in the dream city afterwards would be
children of the Mother?*

*Generation after generation, everyone in the dream city would become a
child of the Mother... In the end, whether it's Mr. Fool or that
Celestial Worthy who wakes up, they would bear the identity of being a
child of the Great Mother, in a mystical sense?*

The more Lumian thought about it, the more inexplicably terrified he
became.

This was a subtle, gradual influence, like boiling a frog in warm water.
Given enough time, the Great Mother would inevitably achieve Her goal.

Of course, this was assuming that Mr. Fool and the Celestial Worthy
didn't offer effective resistance, and that this dream continued for at
least five generations, spanning a century.

*These great existences are all cunning...* After sighing
inwardly, Lumian nodded slightly and responded to Grimm, "Okay."

Grimm's face lit up with joy as he said in a prayerful tone, "May the
glory of motherhood be eternal!"

He then approached the iron gates of the ward and looked inside through
the small window barred with iron. Lumian also took two steps forward.

What met their eyes was the burly back of a man wearing blue and white
striped hospital clothes.

The figure was crouching in the corner, fiddling with something.

As Lumian's gaze moved, he noticed several mushrooms with brown caps and
white stems growing where the wall met the floor. They looked fresh and
plump, as if they had just been transplanted from a rain-soaked forest.

Bang! Lumian knocked on the iron door, and Grimm yielded the window
position to him.

Hearing the knock, the figure stood up and dashed to the door, revealing
a face with thick facial hair. It was indeed Li Keji, the biology
teacher from Star Tutoring Classes, and the "Legendary Druid" Frank Lee
in reality.

Lumian could see that Mr. Fool's dream subconscious had localized the
character of Li Keji to some extent, not setting him as a foreigner.
Thus, his eyes were deep brown, and his facial features were softer.

"Finally, someone's here!" Li Keji said excitedly. "Go tell your dean
and department head that I don't have mental problems. It's just that
many people can't accept my ideas."

His eyes were pure and passionate.

*I can only accept them to a limited extent...* Lumian, who had
read "The Great Adventurer 6: Future", muttered silently before asking
seriously, "What are your ideas?"

Li Keji was eager to share. "For humans, the most important thing is
food. There are still many people in this world suffering from hunger.

"To solve this problem, we need some new plants that meet the following
conditions:

"First, they're not picky about the environment. Second, they don't need
meticulous care. Third, they have a high annual yield. Fourth,
preferably they can be harvested frequently. Fifth, they're
nutritionally rich and can meet all human needs...

"I found that mushrooms meet most of my requirements, but they're not
enough. They have insufficient yield, monotonous nutrition, narrow taste
range, and so on!

"I've been thinking about how to make different types of mushrooms that
have different tastes, different nutritional profiles, and different
characteristics. For example, ones that are pest-resistant,
disease-resistant, can grow and reproduce on their own, taste like beef,
produce milk when bitten, and have flesh as delicate as fish..."

Hearing this, Lumian's eyelid twitched.

*Some of these new varieties sound very similar to those mushrooms from
the New City of Silver...*

*Could they all be Frank Lee's inventions?*

*Have I eaten new mushrooms created by Frank Lee?*

*No wonder I felt something was off at the time...*

Lumian glanced at Grimm before saying to the talkative Li Keji, "I can
accept your explanation and your ideas."

"See? Those people don't understand science, they even called the police
to arrest me!" Li Keji's eyes brightened. "I've been thinking for a long
time, and finally came up with a way to realize my ideas."

"What is it?" Lumian raised an eyebrow.

Li Keji said excitedly, "Genetic modification technology!"

For a moment, both Lumian and Grimm fell silent.

After several seconds, Lumian finally grumbled to himself, "So you
transplanted all of a cow's genes into a mushroom?"

Li Keji continued, "My research is progressing steadily, and I already
have mature samples.

"Yes, they still have various problems, but that doesn't negate their
epoch-making significance.

"Those mushrooms just happen to moo, or eat grass, or swim, or run, or
drink their own milk. These aren't big problems! Yet they think I'm
crazy, that I'm endangering public safety!"

*I think so too...* Lumian was momentarily speechless.

"..."

Grimm was shocked. After a few seconds, he remembered something. "Did
you give some dried mushrooms to..."

He stopped abruptly, not finishing the question.

At that time, monitoring Zhou Mingrui's workstation and having access to
all surveillance cameras in the entire building, he had fully witnessed
the mutation of those dried mushrooms, and knew their ultimate fate and
the potential hidden dangers they had sown.

"I did give some to my colleagues at the tutoring center, but
unfortunately there were too few to reward the students," Li Keji said
regretfully.

Lumian secretly breathed a sigh of relief and said to Li Keji, "Geniuses
are always lonely, misunderstood by others."

"No, I'm not a genius. I just have an enthusiastic heart and the courage
to put ideas into practice," Li Keji said, not out of modesty but
genuine belief.

"Either way, your original intention wasn't wrong," Lumian could only
say this.

He raised his right hand towards Li Keji.

Li Keji understood his intention and reached his own hand through the
iron bars, giving him a high five.

"I'll report your situation, but I can't make the decision," Lumian said
sincerely.

"Thank you," Li Keji's face was full of gratitude.

As he returned to the bed area to study the mushrooms again, Lumian
walked towards the stairwell and said to Grimm, "He's already pregnant."

In reality, he wasn't.

Before Grimm could respond, Lumian added, "But it will take a week for
the embryo to stabilize. Then the obstetrics staff can intervene. Before
that, no interference can be made."

"I see... Alright, I'll remind them," Grimm didn't understand to what
extent godhood limited by this world could achieve.

After leaving Mushu Hospital and watching Grimm leave, Lumian walked
across the street and got into the gray sedan driven by Anthony.

Looking at the entrance of Mushu Hospital, he pondered for a moment
before saying, "Try to rescue Li Keji from the psychiatric ward within a
week."

Otherwise, the "false pregnancy" would be exposed, and he would
inevitably be suspected.

Moreover, by then, the bestowed of the Great Mother could still remedy
the situation and make Li Keji truly pregnant.

Just as Lumian finished speaking, he suddenly saw two cars stop at the
entrance of Mushu Hospital. Among the people getting out were Huang
Jiajia, Miss Bernie Huang, and several men in suits.

*Is Huang Jiajia bringing help to rescue Li Keji?*

*Miss Huang won't do anything illegal openly, so those people must be
lawyers and some officials, trying to get Li Keji out through proper
procedures?*

*Even if those mushrooms are really like biochemical toxins, Miss Huang
can't change the fact that Li Keji is guilty and has mental problems.
But she can find a way to transfer him to another hospital, without
keeping him in Mushu Hospital...*

*Does this count as a covert struggle between two official forces,
symbolizing the confrontation between Mr. Fool and the Celestial Worthy?
Does Mr. Fool's subconscious want to protect Li Keji?*

Lumian watched thoughtfully.
