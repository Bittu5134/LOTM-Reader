## Chapter 767: Underworld

With Lumian vanishing before the crystal skull, the human skulls,
already covered in countless cracks, lost their support.

They shattered with a thunderous crash, bringing down the shadows from
above and splitting the grassy wilderness into fragments.

Oxyto's Paramita crumbled toward the cracked crystal skull, and
everything there silently turned to dust.

The spirits dissipated, the light vanished, and the void of darkness
swallowed everything.

No one knew how much time had passed before a gentle light began to glow
in the absolute blackness, revealing a barren, dim, pale, and almost
frozen wilderness.

In the center of the wasteland lay the tranquil and sacred Lake Dalsh.

The headless lady, draped in a dark-black dress and carrying four heads,
swiftly appeared beside the lake, quietly gazing at its serene,
transparent surface.

†

As soon as Lumian was pulled through the bronze door, he felt countless
eyes upon him, chilling his body further and numbing him.

Meanwhile, arms of unknown origin reached out, grabbing at his head,
neck, torso, and legs.

Some had dull skin with white, bony teeth; others were so decayed that
their flesh was falling off, slowly wriggling with equally decayed
worms; some lacked skin altogether; others were merely illusory Spirit
Bodies...

What they all shared was a bone-chilling cold that could freeze the
soul.

On Lumian's face, the golden mask painted with black and white oil
sparkled with a faint yet pure light. The reaching arms halted
momentarily before retracting.

The eyes watching him from the darkness also withdrew their gaze.

Lumian regained his thoughts and his sense of his body.

Below him, he discovered a deep pit with no visible bottom or
boundaries.

The edge of the pit was made up of layers of blurry worlds, spiraling
downward to the limits of his vision.

These jumbled worlds layered atop each other, and Lumian couldn't make
out what lay within them, only knowing that each was vaster than the
Star Highlands, with all previous watching eyes stemming from the pit's
bottomless dark.

Lumian plummeted suddenly, falling into one of these blurry worlds in
the blink of an eye.

Miraculously, he stood on a barren wilderness exposed with gray-white
rocks, surrounded by heaps of bleached bones, densely packed and
stretching toward various distant places.

At this moment, these bones lay still, as if slumbering through time.

Is this the Underworld? I wonder where the Abscessed Hand's body part
might be. Lumian looked around, muttering to himself in silence.

It was the chance to enter the Underworld that had prompted him to help
voluntarily, using the Eggers family's golden mask and the Underworld
Daoist's seal to push open the bronze door inside the crystal skull.

Now, the problem was that the Underworld was much more vast than he had
anticipated, and he had no idea where to start looking.

Similarly, the whereabouts and intentions of the decaying infant that
Oxyto had sent were unknown.

*Perhaps I could rely on the contract I had signed with the Abscessed
Hand. Essentially being part of the same body, they are mystically
connected. The contract I had signed is, to some extent, also with the
rest of its body...* Lumian quickly formulated a plan and spoke
in a cold, hoarse voice, "Knight of Swords, have all of you entered as
well?"

"Yes," came the faint voice of the Knight of Swords, Maric.

Pausing momentarily, he added, "A companion of mine has also entered."

Lumian nodded. "Why aren't both of you coming out? You are now in a
wraith state, so there's no need to worry about dying instantly in the
Underworld."

*You're essentially undead beings now; what's there to fear about the
Underworld's unique conditions?*

The Knight of Swords responded, "But we are fundamentally still living
beings. If we stay in the Underworld as wraiths for too long, we won't
be able to revert to human form and will forever exist as wraiths or
evil spirits. By using your body, we can temporarily avoid the influence
of the Underworld, emerging only when it's crucial."

"I see..." Lumian looked up at the pale, dim sky, "I also can't wear
this Eggers family's mask for too long. We have about three hours."

As he spoke, Lumian tried to activate without using the black mark on
his right shoulder, which was the Abscessed Hand's Spirit World
Traversal ability.

With this mark, he faintly sensed something at the end of the wilderness
on his right calling to him.

*Is that the body part of the Abscessed Hand in the Underworld?*
Just as Lumian had this thought, a figure appeared ahead.

It was an extremely delicate-looking young woman with an unnaturally
pale complexion. Her deep blue eyes were profound and devoid of any
emotional fluctuation; her light golden hair was tied in a stern bun
adorned with a small black bonnet with a fine black veil, and she wore a
complicated, exquisite black Gothic court dress.

*Is this the temperance faction demigod that was attached to me
earlier?* Lumian recalled the two blurry figures he saw through
the crystalline ice.

One of them matched the lady before him perfectly!

The temperance faction's demigod floated in mid-air, slowly turned
around, and then pointed in a direction, nodding at Lumian.

She was pointing toward the end of the wilderness on the right.

"Do you mean that Oxyto's prematurely born, decayed child might be over
there?" Lumian asked for confirmation.

The lady in the black bonnet nodded gently in affirmation.

She then vanished into thin air, and Lumian felt another chill inside
him.

*It's all in that direction, huh... A coincidence? No, not a
coincidence, it's more likely that something in that direction is
drawing them there...* Lumian turned his body, ready to teleport
to the edge of his vision.

As soon as Lumian started to become transparent, his body was suddenly
grabbed by pale hands that appeared out of nowhere, seizing his arms.

Lumian felt a paralyzing sensation throughout his body, as if his soul
was being torn apart by an invisible force.

This time, the faint glow from the golden mask had no effect.

Lumian attempted to ignite a blazing white flame to ward off the cold,
stiffness, and numbness, but he was overwhelmed by an invisible terror,
trembling uncontrollably, unable to respond effectively.

When he regained his clarity and composure, he found himself still
standing in the same spot, but surrounding layers of bleached bones had
all risen up, encircling him as if to protect him.

At the same time, Lumian heard the voice of the Knight of Swords, Maric:

"Once you put on the Eggers family's mask and become a pure undead
being, you will also possess all the traits of an undead, one of which
is being suppressed by higher beings of the Death pathway, making it
difficult to resist and your body and mind willing to accept
enslavement.

"In contrast, we wraiths, who aren't pure and can switch states freely,
are less affected."

*Was this why I couldn't resist just now? I wonder if the Sword of
Courage can counteract this effect. It theoretically should...*
Lumian realized with a start. "Did both of you save me just now?"

The Knight of Swords didn't continue on this topic but instead reminded
Lumian, "It seems that in the Underworld, you can teleport but not
teleport freely, as that is considered a desecration of Death and
attracts the punishment of the Underworld."

*According to the mystic knowledge mentioned by Madam Magician,
teleporting should be normal in the Underworld since it stems from the
spirit world, but considering it as desecration of Death seems a bit too
strict, typical of the oppression by higher-ranking beings of the Death
pathway...* Lumian pondered for a few seconds, slightly bending
his back.

A blazing white, radiant spear of flame immediately shot forth,
illuminating the pale, dim half-sky, casting towards the far reaches of
the wilderness.

As the white and red trail of the flame spear disappeared inch by inch,
Lumian, transformed into the spear, hurled himself forward at the
fastest speed he could achieve.

During this process, he noticed the wilderness sloped downwards, and the
destination he, the Knight of Swords, and the temperance faction demigod
aimed for was at the bottom of this 'hillside'.

After a while, the blazing white light scattered in all directions, and
Lumian, now clad in a thick jacket, descended toward the ground.

Ahead of him lay a wide, surreal black river, so vast he couldn't see
the other side.

The river flowed silently from the edge of the sky to its limits,
exceptionally quiet.

"Is this the River Styx?" Lumian inquired of the temperance faction
demigod within him.

Responding to Lumian was still the Knight of Swords, Maric: "It should
be. It spans every layer of the Underworld. Crossing it is like entering
the depths of the Underworld. If you hadn't stopped earlier and ended up
flying above it, you would have fallen straight into the river, and no
one would have been able to pull you out."

*Good thing the issue with teleporting just now gave me a warning: it's
best to pause in uncertain environments...* Lumian glanced left
and right, noticing the wilderness was dotted with withered blood
flowers, each concealing a multitude of corpses, bones, and shadows.

"How do I cross?" Lumian sensed that the missing part of the Abscessed
Hand's body was on the other side of the River Styx.

No sooner had he asked, and before the Knight of Swords could respond, a
dilapidated, gloomy black boat suddenly appeared on the shadowy river.

A figure draped in fragments stood on the boat, rowing with a long oar,
guiding the vessel to Lumian's side before stopping at the river's edge.

Peering closely, Lumian saw that the ferryman was a severely decayed
male corpse. Large portions of his body were exposed, and his eyes
appeared gouged out, leaving hollow sockets entwined with thick blood
vessels oozing yellow pus.

"Take this boat across?" Lumian asked, lowering his voice to consult the
temperance faction member inside him.

Knight of Swords Maric replied in an ethereal but slightly grave tone,
"It's the only way... But be careful of the boatman. The Underworld has
mutated, and it could be affected too."
