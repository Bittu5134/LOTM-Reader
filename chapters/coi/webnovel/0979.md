## Chapter 979: Mythical Creature

Faced with the attack from Ludwig, the male version of Jenna, and the
female version of Anthony, Zaratulstra showed no surprise.

His body inside the black formal wear suddenly disintegrated, along with
his face, collapsing inward into a dark vortex.

If one looked closely at this vortex, they would see countless
transparent insects frantically writhing, seemingly crawling into the
observer's mind and body, devouring thoughts and nerves.

From within the sleeves and pant legs of the black formal wear, numerous
slimy tentacles covered in bizarre patterns extended outward.

Zaratulstra had also revealed his Mythical Creature form!

Unlike His Historical Void image, His clothes were real, not part of a
historical projection. They didn't transform into the Mythical Creature,
remaining draped over the surface of the maggot vortex.

This made Him appear even more terrifying.

As Zaratulstra revealed his Mythical Creature form, both the male
version of Jenna and the female version of Anthony instantly froze.

One's hair rapidly grew thicker and longer, their skin losing its
luster, while the other's face became covered in patches of
grayish-white dragon scales.

Silently, their bodies simultaneously collapsed. The former turned into
a writhing mass of flesh, covered in thick, slimy, and bizarre black
hair as thick as small snakes. The tips of these hairs struggled to open
black and white eyes or stick out snake-like tongues. The latter
disintegrated into several lizards covered in grayish-white dragon
scales.

They had lost control.

Although Zaratulstra's Mythical Creature form was suppressed to the
Sequence 7 level, as deep Mirror People, their mental states were
already unstable, and their emotions tended towards extremes. Naturally,
they couldn't help but lose control.

With this development, Ludwig's movements slowed slightly, his mind
bearing the impact of the female Anthony's indiscriminate Frenzy.

Just as he was about to succumb to the male Jenna's Charm and turn to
devour that mass of flesh, the two out-of-control deep Mirror People
began to fade and become transparent, quickly disappearing.

They were illusory to begin with.

Ludwig could only open his mouth wide, his mouth corners splitting to
the back of his head.

Then, he leaped towards Zaratulstra's Mythical Creature form in its
black formal wear, biting down on one of the extended bizarre tentacles.

He wanted to use this to Deprive Zaratulstra of His Paper Figurine
Substitutes ability.

*Crack!*

Ludwig bit down, but only crushed a paper figurine.

Zaratulstra, transformed into a Mythical Creature, appeared in midair.
Within the dark vortex of countless maggots that formed His face,
several differently colored gems seemed to light up simultaneously.

Around Ludwig, who still had the paper figurine in his mouth, numerous
illusory doors suddenly appeared.

These illusory doors took various forms: some double-doored, some
single, some barely showing a crack, some covered in mysterious
patterns... They were densely packed and numerous, completely enveloping
Ludwig.

As Zaratulstra waved His slimy tentacles, one of the illusory doors
suddenly opened, welcoming Ludwig as he was thrown towards it.

Ludwig's figure instantly disappeared into the profound darkness behind
the door.

Exile!

This was a Secrets Sorcerer ability that Zaratulstra used with the aid
of a certain Sealed Artifact. It could throw the target into a
corresponding space-time turbulence, only able to return after five
seconds. Of course, complete return was contingent on the person or
object thrown into the space-time turbulence being able to withstand its
impact.

Combined with a Miracle Invoker's influence on fate, this could banish
Ludwig for a full ten seconds.

In just two or three seconds, Zaratulstra had permanently or temporarily
dealt with the third wave of attacking enemies.

He spoke again in the Dragonese, "My wish is: that no one else will
interfere with me from now on."

As soon as the words were spoken, Zaratulstra realized His wish.

Affected by this aspect of his abilities being suppressed to Sequence 7,
the realization of his wish had clear boundaries---it was limited to
only the next thirty seconds, with poor effectiveness against enemies
possessing godhood. The stronger the godhood, the more likely they were
to break through the restrictions and interfere with him.

At this moment, Jenna, hiding in one of the tunnels, suddenly found
herself unable to "traverse" to the corresponding area behind the
mirror.

Zaratulstra, maintaining His Mythical Creature form, descended from
midair, floating towards the glass mirror surface leading to the hot pot
restaurant's private room.

*Rumble!*

He heard a faint explosion and saw a place in the area behind the mirror
where an illusory curtain seemed to be pushed up, but not completely
broken through.

Inside the Realm of Mysteries.

When Lumian threw the Sword of Courage and used the Spell of Harrumph,
Zaratulstra's historical projection instantly swapped positions with His
marionette.

The marionette, hit by the two beams of white light, only shook
slightly.

His spirit was essentially already dead.

*Rumble!*

The Sword of Courage struck the weak point of the Realm of Mysteries,
creating a terrifying explosion, but failed to penetrate through.

Amidst this chaos, Lumian's figure disappeared, Blinking to the side of
Zaratulstra's Historical Void image.

His left hand was already raised, the silver bracelet on his wrist
glowing with a silvery-white light tinged with black.

Circle Inhabitant!

Lumian once again used Circle Inhabitant, targeting the position of
Zaratulstra's Historical Void image!

Of course, this attempt also forced him to face the other's Mythical
Creature form directly. His thoughts and joints were once again filled
with glue, and his mental state showed signs of some confusion.

It was only because he possessed godhood, and the other's Mythical
Creature form was also limited to the Sequence 7 level, that he didn't
lose control on the spot. Otherwise, even if he hadn't lost control
immediately, he would have been in a state where his mind was swept by a
storm, unable to continue subsequent actions.

Just as Zaratulstra's Historical Void image was about to continue
swapping positions with His marionette, He suddenly found the attempt
failed.

He remained in place.

Seizing this opportunity, Lumian, his eyes showing a silver-black color,
suddenly pushed his right palm forward.

All his remaining spirituality surged towards the river of fate of
Zaratulstra's historical projection.

Compelling Fate!

He wanted to compel the fate of Zaratulstra's historical projection to
rush towards the imagined tributary!

Due to the influence of Zaratulstra's historical projection's own
status, the probability of success for this action was actually not
high. But as a historical projection, there was a natural flaw, problem,
and weakness in terms of fate, which was the time limit on their
existence.

If Lumian wanted to compel fate to make Zaratulstra's historical
projection fall into dire straits and be killed by his subsequent
attacks, it would depend on whether Mr. Fool would provide protection.
But if he chose the fate tributary of "historical projection prematurely
terminated due to unexpected influence", there was a considerable chance
of achieving the goal!

In an instant, Lumian's spirituality was completely drained, forcing him
to release the part he had accumulated in advance to barely support
himself.

His body involuntarily leaned back slightly, and on his bright face,
streams of blood flowed from his eyes, nose, and the corners of his
mouth. His black long hair seemed to have gained its own vitality,
floating upwards and becoming slightly thicker.

This was the backlash from directly viewing the fate of a Mythical
Creature.

Not only did one of his eyes go blind immediately, but his entire person
became like a marionette, temporarily unable to think or move.

Almost simultaneously, Zaratulstra's Historical Void image became
semi-transparent, with ripples appearing on its surface.

It was as if some accident had prevented the spirituality of
Zaratulstra's main body from penetrating the Realm of Mysteries to
maintain the existence of the historical projection.

In the blink of an eye, Zaratulstra's Historical Void image faded to
invisibility, completely dissipating.

Without His presence, Lumian finally recovered.

His blue eye, covered in a blood mist, saw the black curtain enveloping
this area rapidly collapsing. He saw that male marionette, having lost
the control of Zaratulstra's Historical Void image and being isolated
from Zaratulstra's main body by the Realm of Mysteries, standing still,
motionless.

Taking advantage of the Realm of Mysteries not yet completely
collapsing, Lumian took out a mirror, reflected that marionette, and
cursed it with the Fire of Destruction.

The male marionette immediately erupted with black flames suppressing
madness and destruction from the inside out, its body beginning to melt
like steel.

Lumian didn't look at him again. After the Realm of Mysteries further
collapsed, he used the ability of Mirror Traversal to return to the area
behind the mirror.

Just as Zaratulstra approached the glass mirror surface, He sensed
movement behind Him.

This maggot vortex, clad in black formal wear and extending numerous
bizarre tentacles, suddenly turned around to see Lumian, one eye covered
in blood, the other unfocused, with blood flowing from them.

Although Lumian didn't directly look at this complete Mythical Creature,
only glancing towards the black shoes where things were vaguely crawling
out, he still fell into intermittent thought stutters and slight mental
confusion.

His tendency towards madness worsened.

At this moment, he had already retrieved the Sword of Courage with
invisible spider silk. Holding this iron-black straight sword burning
with scarlet flames in both hands, he was about to strike at Zaratulstra
from a distance.

After overcoming difficulties and launching several waves of attacks, he
and his teammates had finally taken out Zaratulstra's marionette and
Historical Void image, and could now challenge His main body!

Within the dark vortex that formed Zaratulstra's head, each worm emitted
an elderly voice.

The words they spoke came together, forming echoing speech in just one
second.

"To be able to end my Historical Void image in such a short time, I'm
indeed a bit surprised.

"But it doesn't matter, I'll just summon another one."

As He spoke, Zaratulstra extended a bizarre, slimy tentacle and dragged
out another version of Himself from the fog of history.

This was still him as a Sequence 1 Attendant of Mysteries.

If it weren't for His concern about the hidden enemy who used the power
of Distortion to transfer Him to the mirror world, Zaratulstra felt He
could have killed this group entirely, rather than just thinking about
escaping this place.

At this moment, Lumian couldn't help but feel a bit of despair.

*Zaratulstra still has the spirituality to summon a Historical Void
image?*

*Is this what an Angel is? Even suppressed to Sequence 7, so many of us
have only taken out His marionette, not even scratching His
skin!*

Courage and madness occupied Lumian's body. Without fear, he slashed out
a highly compressed scarlet fire serpent towards Zaratulstra and His
Historical Void image from a distance.
