## Chapter 1024: A Blurry Ritual

*A Card of Blasphemy?*

*A Card of Blasphemy representing a path to godhood, created by Emperor
Roselle based on the second Blasphemy Slate and His personal
experience?* Lumian and Franca were both shocked.

They had learned about the Cards of Blasphemy from Emperor Roselle's
diary and various mystical knowledge they had collected through
different channels. But items of this level naturally possessed
anti-prophecy and anti-divination properties, so they had only heard
about them and never seen one with their own eyes.

Now, the Demoness card appeared before them.

This was a gift left for Lumian by the mirrored Emperor Roselle!

In a flash, Lumian instinctively had a thought.

*Is She really being so kind?*

At this moment, Queen Mystic spoke again, "It's real."

"A real Card of Blasphemy, a real Demoness card?" Franca curiously
leaned in, examining this long-coveted item.

Lumian remained silent for a few seconds, then chuckled and reached out
to take the Demoness card.

He had already accrued so many "debts" and had so many "creditors", what
was one more!

Queen Mystic looked at the Card of Blasphemy in Lumian's hand and said
after a moment of silence, "The activation incantation should be my
name, in ancient Feysac."

*Name...* Lumian chanted in a low voice, "Bernadette."

Instantly, the Demoness card generated an invisible vortex, frantically
drawing in Lumian's spirit and spirituality.

Soon, the Demoness card became three-dimensional, transforming into a
miniature book.

The book opened naturally, revealing a Roselle dressed as an Assassin's
Creed character, a clean-shaven male Roselle.

Next to this character image was a corresponding description in ancient
Feysac:

"Sequence 9, Assassin.

"Every Assassin possesses the ability to change their body for a short
time, gaining feather-like lightness to perform a Leap of Faith, and has
eagle-like vision and night vision, excelling in combat, evasion, and
concealment.

"Shadows are their friends and their camouflage. Once they leave the
shadows, they use their agile footwork to gather all their strength for
a fatal strike on their target...

"Potion formula..."

Lumian reached out to touch the Card of Blasphemy that had become a
miniature book, watching it continuously flip pages, seeing Emperor
Roselle's image change from male to female, becoming increasingly
beautiful and alluring, gradually "overlapping" with the appearance of
the mirrored Roselle.

Finally, an image of the mirrored Emperor Roselle, seemingly much
younger and resembling a young girl, appeared before Lumian's eyes.

The corresponding information was also revealed:

"Sequence 3: Unaging (Demoness of Unaging).

"Every Demoness of Unaging is forever youthful, skilled in resurrection,
bizarrely difficult to kill, a darling of the mirror world, a true
Gorgon...

"Potion formula:

"Main ingredients: One heart of a Mirror God, a pair of Gorgon eyes;

"Supplementary ingredients: Nine Mirror God fragments, 80 ml of Gorgon
blood, an antique mirror over 500 years old with a corresponding mirror
realm, 22 drops of water from a drowned person's lungs;

"Ritual: Find your mirror self, enslave them solely with your own power,
or make them truly infatuated with you, or reconcile with them."

Seeing this, Lumian and Franca once again recalled Krismona's mention of
"reconciling with your mirror self."

Will different handling methods result in different manifestations
later? Lumian pondered for a while, then turned to the next page:

"Sequence 2: Catastrophe (Demoness of Catastrophe).

"Demonesses of Catastrophe bring various natural disasters such as
blizzards, floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, meteor strikes, etc. Everyone
who mentions their names feels fear from the bottom of their hearts...

"Potion formula...

"Ritual: As a participant, cause a disaster affecting the entire
continent, and advance during the disaster."

Lumian didn't read the specific formula in detail, just skimmed the
Sequence name and corresponding ritual.

He turned to the next page:

"Sequence 1: Apocalypse (Demoness of Apocalypse).

___

"Ritual: Advance at the universally acknowledged end of an epoch or the
beginning of the next; advance during the signs and process of the
apocalypse's arrival; advance when one's own involvement leads to the
fall of a deity.

"Any one of the three rituals is effective."

*According to the mirrored Emperor Roselle's words and my deductions,
the apocalypse will come early... Disasters frequently occur during the
apocalypse, which indeed suits Demonesses...* Lumian
unconsciously held his breath and turned the Card of Blasphemy to the
last page:

"Sequence 0: Demoness (Primordial Demoness, Chaos Demoness)

"The source of catastrophes, symbol of the apocalypse, the Demoness who
wields chaos, ruler of the mirror world, corresponding to the feminine
aspect of the Original Creator.

"Potion formula:

"Ingredients: Demoness Uniqueness, three Demoness of Apocalypse Beyonder
characteristics...

"Ritual..."

Lumian wanted to see what the apotheosis ritual for the Demoness pathway
was, but found that the corresponding text was blurry and unclear, as if
obscured by some force.

*Did the mirrored Emperor Roselle do this when leaving this gift, or was
it like this when She obtained this Demoness card?* Lumian
turned his head to look at Queen Mystic.

"Your Highness, can you see the content of the apotheosis ritual
clearly?"

Bernadette stared for a moment, then slowly shook her head.

"The power obscuring the corresponding content is of a very high level,
at least Sequence 0."

Lumian and Franca exchanged glances but didn't pursue the matter
further.

For them, the apotheosis ritual was a distant matter. They should focus
on the Demoness of Unaging first.

"Since I wasn't kicked out of the dream, I can also participate in your
operation tomorrow," Queen Mystic said in a somewhat low voice, looking
towards the window area where Huang Tao had been standing earlier.

"Thank you," Lumian said without being polite.

He put the Demoness card into his Traveler's Bag.

___

When Lumian and the others returned to Xinhong District, the sunlight
was still bright, and it wasn't even afternoon tea time yet.

"Should we let Ludwig eat that mushroom now?" Franca pulled out a chair
and sat down, asking with a mix of nervousness and curiosity.

Lumian thought for a few seconds, then said with a smile, "Yes."

"But you should leave first, go back to Dechuang Garden. I'm afraid your
life might be ended by the mutation brought by the mushroom."

This wasn't saying that the mushroom could directly harm Franca, but
that the corresponding mutation might be very extreme, drawing the
Celestial Worthy's attention, which would be completely unbearable for
Franca, who hadn't fully digested the Despair potion.

"Alright..." Franca suppressed her inner emotions and returned to
Dechuang Garden through the mirror world.

Only then did Lumian sit down in the chair Franca had just pulled out
and say to Ludwig, "You can eat it now."

Ludwig had been holding back for a long time and quickly took out the
dried jellyfish-like mushroom.

Seeing this, Lumian turned his head to Anthony and said, "Pay attention
to placating his mind and emotions."

"Okay." Anthony's eyes became vertical, reflecting Ludwig's figure in
that pale golden color.

Ludwig swallowed and looked at the mushroom with a hint of fear as he
stuffed it into his mouth.

He chewed it up, then swallowed it with satisfaction.

Lumian and Anthony's spirits instantly tensed to the extreme.

As time passed second by second, Ludwig finally opened his mouth and
evaluated the changes after eating it.

"I can create a kind of spore that enters the human body, repairing
nerves and flesh, merging with spirituality and soul.

"This might wake up people in vegetative states, but the condition of
patients after merging with the spores is currently unknown..."

As Ludwig spoke, Lumian and Anthony saw masses of flesh writhing under
his skin, sometimes bulging the skin outwards, sometimes sinking
inwards.

This made Ludwig look like he was wearing a skin suit.

Suddenly, the skin on his neck split open, and a wet brown mushroom grew
out of the flesh.

Ludwig raised his right hand nonchalantly, plucked off this mushroom
with a snap, and stuffed it into his mouth, chewing and swallowing it.

The wound on his neck quickly healed.

And so, mushrooms intermittently grew out of Ludwig's body, sometimes of
the same species, sometimes different, and he plucked them all off,
using them as snacks.

This formed a strange balance.

"Can eating these mushrooms make you full?" Lumian asked curiously,
secretly breathing a sigh of relief.

Ludwig glanced at his godfather. "Can you get full by sucking your own
fingers?"

Lumian and Anthony immediately understood the answer.

Anthony then looked at Lumian. "Should we take him to Red Moon Hospital
now to try and treat An Xiaotian?"

Lumian pondered for several minutes before answering, "There's no rush.
Let's wait until tomorrow, when we officially take action."

Anthony didn't hide his confusion, but seeing that Lumian didn't explain
further, he calmly closed his mouth.

*If he's not saying, there must be a reason for not saying it.*

___

The next morning.

Lumian stood on the balcony of the master bedroom, gazing at the
tree-lined internal roads of the community and the slowly passing
electric cars and bicycles.

After a while, he reluctantly withdrew his gaze, walked into the living
room, and placed the magic mirror Arrodes on the dining table.

After the previous rental, they had figured out the rules for using this
magic mirror:

Only three questions could be asked within 24 hours, and they could be
asked at intervals.

Lumian looked at the silver mirror with ancient patterns and a black
gemstone on each side, and calmly said in the presence of Anthony and
Ludwig, "Great Arrodes, I want to ask you a question, the first question
of today."

The surface of the ancient silver mirror suddenly darkened, and lines of
blood-red ancient Feysac words appeared: "I can answer any question you
ask, but you must also answer an equal number of questions from me, in
the presence of at least one witness.

"If you refuse to answer, or if you lie, you will face punishment."

Lumian nodded and revealed a bright smile. "My question is, is it a
coincidence that the Celestial Worthy's attempt to use the Mirror People
and your birth as a mirror occurred at the same time?"

On the magic mirror, the blood-red words quickly lost their color and
contracted into a single, lonely word: "No."
