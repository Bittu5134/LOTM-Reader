## Chapter 47: Truly "Illiterate"

Aurore looked at the slightly stained white tablecloth and smiled at
Lumian.

"If you're the target of ritualistic magic, it doesn't matter if the
altar is dirty. But if you want to pray to a deity or a hidden
existence, I suggest you change to a cleaner piece of cloth or remove
the cloth and wipe the table."

"Anything works if I'm just praying to yourself, right?" Lumian teased.

Aurore chuckled.

"That refers to the environment, materials, and equipment, but the
ritual process and incantations must strictly follow the rules of
mysticism."

She pulled out an orange candle from her pocket.

"This is a candle mixed with citrus and lavender. It has nothing to do
with their domain; I just like it."

Aurore waved the candle above the altar.

"Remember, the candle representing the deity is placed in these two
places. It can be empty now."

Then she placed the candle close to her.

"Remember, this is the location of 'me'."

Next, Aurore brought a cup of water, a plate of coarse salt, and a small
steel bowl from the kitchen.

"We need to create a clean and undisturbed ritual environment. Clean in
the sense of spirituality. We have to construct it ourselves. Enter
Cogitation and focus your mind. You can guide the spiritual power out
through supplementary items and build a wall of spirituality around the
altar.

"Mystery Pryers and Seers find this simple. Hunters need the help of
other items before reaching Sequence 7. For example, incense to calm
your emotions and make you ethereal, or a crystal ball to help you focus
on your spirituality.

"The meditation I taught you before is incomplete. It's only the first
step. It can only gather your thoughts and calm you down. I'll teach you
the rest later."

Lumian was surprised.* Why can I activate the dream's specialness and
make the two symbols appear if the meditation method is
incomplete?*

Aurore pulled out a silver dagger.

"Watch carefully how I build the wall of spirituality."

Lumian was stunned and blurted out, "Why do you have so many things on
you?"

First, there were various casting materials, a retractable telescope, a
miniature ink bottle that stored the spirit world creature, White Paper,
and candles for rituals. Now, she had taken out a dagger.

Aurore sighed in exasperation.

"Do you think I want to? It's just inconvenient for Warlocks.

"It takes me a long time to alter each of my clothes. Sometimes, I even
feel like Doraemon. I can take out whatever I want."

"What ---Amon?" Lumian asked, not understanding the reference.

Aurore hesitated for a moment before replying with a mixed expression,
"You don't need to know."

Lumian suddenly felt a pang of sadness for his sister.

Aurore composed herself and reached for the orange candle representing
her.

"In ritualistic magic, candles can't simply be lit. Of course, there are
times when ordinary methods can work, but that's not always the case,"
Aurore explained. "The correct way is to extend your spirituality, rub
it against the wick, and light it."

As she spoke, she lit the candle with a spark of spirituality, and it
burned with an orange flame.

The dining table transformed into an altar, and the surrounding area was
bathed in a deep, otherworldly light.

Aurore's light-blue eyes had darkened, and an invisible wind swirled
around her as she plunged the silver dagger into the coarse salt and
began chanting a mysterious incantation.

"XXX, XXX!

"..."

Lumian was bewildered as he watched his sister complete the incantation
and draw out the silver dagger. She stabbed it into the cup of water and
raised it again.

Aurore pointed the dagger outward and began to walk around the altar.
With each step she took, Lumian sensed an invisible force emanating from
the dagger. It was agile and lively, mingling with the air to create an
impenetrable barrier.

As Aurore completed the circle, Lumian felt as if she had been
transported to a different realm.

"Did you understand the steps?" Aurore's voice sounded distant.

Lumian nodded truthfully.

"Yes, but I don't understand what you mean."

Aurore could not help but laugh.

"You're completely illiterate when it comes to mysticism. Literally.
That's Hermes. When translated, it's:

"I sanctify you, blade of pure silver!

"I cleanse and purify you, allowing you to serve me in this ritual!

†

"In the name of Warlock Aurore Lee,

"You have been sanctified!"

Lumian scratched his head. "It sounds ordinary."

"That's just the translation. The meaning of the incantation and the
language used is what's important," Aurore explained, her eyes lighting
up. "In Intisian, it might sound ordinary, but if you use Hermes,
ancient Hermes, Elvish, Dragonese, or Jotun, you can tap into
superpowers. That's what sets them apart."

Lumian asked curiously, "Are these the only languages that can
communicate with the mysterious?"

"No, there are many other languages in the field of mysticism, each with
its own specialties. For example, some are specifically meant for the
undead, but most Beyonders won't be able to use them unless they want to
study a unique and rare domain or perform the corresponding ritual,"
Aurore explained casually.

She went on to explain the incantation.

"During the sanctification ritual, the penultimate sentence should be in
the name of a certain deity or a hidden existence, but as wild
Beyonders, it's best not to use them to avoid unnecessary trouble.

"As a Beyonder, it's enough to use your name to sanctify an ordinary
item. Although it won't be as effective as the original version, it can
still be used."

Lumian nodded, then asked, "You came up with my name. Can I use it in
the ritual?"

Aurore replied confidently, "Yes. A completely new name wouldn't work,
but your name has been in use for several years, so there's a mystic
connection."

She paused for a moment before continuing, "If you're in the wild and
don't have many materials, you can complete the ritual with simple salt
or clear water."

With that, Aurore pulled out a small silver-black metal bottle from her
pocket.

"This is my own concoction of essential oil called 'Wizard of Oz.' What
sets it apart is that it smells good," Aurore explained as she dripped
three drops of light green liquid on the candle representing her.

The light of the candle flickered and sizzled, and a faint mist spread
out, giving Aurore and the altar an air of mystique.

"Now for the important part," Aurore said, pulling a small faux goatskin
from her pocket. "If you're holding a ritualistic magic that prays to a
deity, you need to draw the symbol of what you want on the paper and
burn it during the ritual.

"The first part is a prayer for someone's power. This 'someone' needs to
be replaced by the symbol of a deity, an honorific name, or a domain
ruled over by Them. For example, I pray for the power of the Sun or the
power of Order. Remember, there are always two sentences that correspond
to the two candles that represent the deity.

"The second part is 'I pray for the God's loving grace.' Remember, don't
call Him by His name. Doing so in a ritual is sacrilegious. The Eternal
Blazing Sun can be referred to as God or Father.

"The third part is what you want to pray for. You must be brief and
finish it in one sentence.

"The fourth part is to give more power to the incantation. For example,
'Sun Flower, a herb that belongs to the Sun. Please bestow your powers
to my incantation.' You can choose two to three types based on the
materials used.

"After reciting the incantation, drip a drop of essential oil on each
candle and burn the piece of paper that was used to draw the symbol.
After the paper is burned, the ritual comes to an end. Then, thank the
deity and extinguish the candles in the order of 'me', followed by
'god', right to left. Dispel the wall of spirituality. Oh, and remember
to light the candles from left to right, beginning with 'god' followed
by 'me'."

Lumian nodded twice in acknowledgement before asking, "What about
praying to yourself?"

Aurore chuckled before explaining, "The incantation is even simpler.
I'll use summoning spirit world creatures as an example. For the first
part, there's only one word: 'I'. Remember, you can't use modern Hermes
here. It has to be ancient Hermes, Elvish, Dragonese, or Jotun. The
second part is 'I summon in my name,' which can be said in modern
Hermes. The third part is the exact description of the summoned spirit
world creature."

Lumian was curious. "What's an exact description?"

Aurore explained solemnly, "It needs to be limited to three lines to
help us lock onto the creature we want to summon."

"For instance, if someone said they were looking for the prankster of
Cordu Village, Aurore Lee's idiot brother, and a regular customer of Ol'
Tavern, we know exactly who they're looking for because of the specific
characteristics given."

"I get it!" Lumian was enlightened. "So, if we don't know the target's
name, appearance, or address, we can use their characteristics to help
find them."

Aurore said seriously, "That's the principle, but there are many
problems when put into practice. For example, when summoning creatures
from the spirit world, the first sentence is often fixed. It's either
'the spirit that wanders about the unfounded' or 'spirit wandering above
the world.' Its function is to point to the spirit world and clearly
state that we want to summon a spirit.

"The second sentence is also very universal. We don't summon spirit
world creatures to harm ourselves, so we must restrict it to friendly
creatures. Sometimes, we also add the word 'weak'. This is because some
spirit world creatures may be very friendly, but their existence can
bring great danger.

"Considering these circumstances, the description is fixed. 'The
friendly creature that can be subordinated', 'the friendly creature that
can be consulted', 'the weak creature that can be subordinated', and so
on.

"But based on these two descriptions, the direction is still very broad.
It doesn't reflect our needs. Therefore, the third description is very
important. You need to use a sentence to clearly explain what creature
you want to summon."

"Sounds very difficult." Lumian felt a headache just thinking about it.

Aurore nodded.

"Not only is it difficult, but it's also dangerous. When the direction
is vague, it might summon a spirit you don't need or a creature that
brings danger. Remember, being weak doesn't mean it can't kill you, just
like being friendly doesn't mean it won't pose a threat to you."
