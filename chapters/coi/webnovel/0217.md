## Chapter 217: Notarization

Église Saint-Robert stood proudly near the Suhit steam locomotive
station, serving as the bishop cathedral of the Eternal Blazing Sun
Church in Le Marché du Quartier du Gentleman.

Its distinctive onion-shaped dome was painted in shimmering gold,
representing the radiant sun. Below it stood a white building with
gilded edges and a monumental Sun Sacred Emblem.

Adjacent to the cathedral was a bell tower, crowned by a roof fashioned
from a gleaming golden sphere.

Observing Jenna entering the cathedral amidst the morning prayer
congregation, Franca opted to wait in close proximity.

Uncertain whether the Eternal Blazing Sun cathedral possessed any
peculiar enchantments that could render her invisibility ineffective,
she remained cautious, unwilling to take any unnecessary risks.

Église Saint-Robert, much like other cathedrals belonging to the Eternal
Blazing Sun Church, boasted a resplendent golden base and was adorned
with gilded accents throughout. The ornate structure, adorned with
vibrant stained glass windows and a vast mural depicting a saint in
vivid hues of blue, green, and red, exuded an atmosphere of profound
sanctity and grandeur. Every worshiper who entered its hallowed halls
couldn't help but bow their heads in reverence, enveloped by the sacred
ambiance.

Jenna made her way to the front of the altar and settled into the second
row of seats.

Closing her eyes, she inclined her head forward and crossed her arms,
placing them reverently upon her chest.

Having been baptized and frequented the Eternal Blazing Sun cathedral
since her youth, Jenna was intimately familiar with this customary
ritual, even though she could hardly be considered devout. She swiftly
cleared her mind of any distracting thoughts, focusing her entire being
on the act of prayer.

Time seemed to stand still as the bishop delivered his sermon.

After nearly fifteen minutes, Jenna opened her eyes and quietly rose to
her feet. She proceeded towards a long table positioned along the side
of the main hall.

This table spanned an impressive length of 20 to 30 meters, adorned with
slender white candles flickering within golden lamps.

Devotees seeking to express their gratitude or admiration for a saint or
angel could purchase a candle from the clergyman stationed beside the
table, lighting it and placing it within an unoccupied lamp.

Jenna fixed her gaze upon the softly swaying flames for a few fleeting
moments before redirecting her attention towards the clergyman dressed
in a white robe interwoven with threads of gold.

Her eyes caught sight of a man engaging in the purchase of candles.

He appeared to be in his late twenties, his blond hair immaculately
styled and subtly enhanced with cosmetics. His eyes resembled the vivid
azure of a tranquil lake, albeit relatively small in size.

Adorned in a white shirt, a yellow vest, and a slim blue tweed coat
adorned with two golden buttons, he bore a resemblance to the slightly
distinguished gentlemen of Trier, with discernible traces of makeup
enhancing his features.

As the man approached an unoccupied lamp with his acquired candle, Jenna
moved closer to the clergyman in the resplendent white robe interwoven
with golden threads, extending her arms in a welcoming gesture.

"Praise the Sun!"

"Praise the Sun!" the clergyman warmly replied, his smile radiating
genuine warmth.

Jenna hesitated briefly for a couple of seconds before uttering, "I seek
a blessed necklace."

Comparing it to the purchase of candles, this act was more devout.

But, naturally, it came with a higher price tag.

The clergyman's smile widened.

"Sister, how about this one?"

He produced a necklace adorned with a gold Sunbird pendant from among
the unsold white candles.

Two rose-red rubies were nestled within the eyes of the Sunbird.

In the Eternal Blazing Sun Church, just as "Brother" was used to address
men of the faith, female believers were affectionately called "Sisters."
Some nuns even formed an alliance known as the Nine Sisters Association,
working hand in hand with the Brotherhood Minor.

Jenna couldn't help but sense that this particular necklace must be
quite expensive---she could almost hear her wallet crying in protest.

After careful consideration, she ultimately settled on a relatively
simple amulet featuring a small Sun Sacred Emblem.

It set her back 30 verl d'or, causing her to wince at the cost.

As an underground singer in the market district, Jenna earned a decent
income, especially since her recent rise in popularity. However, it had
only been a month since she began gaining recognition. Previously, her
earnings were barely sufficient to cover rent, food, performance attire,
makeup supplies, and the like, without having to rely on her family for
financial support.

Despite now earning nearly 300 verl d'or a month through part-time work,
her financial situation still left her feeling uneasy. She had to save
for next year's tuition, ensure her mother wouldn't worry, and even
contribute to the family's debts.

With the newly acquired amulet adorning her neck, Jenna took a deep
breath and departed from Église Saint-Robert, making her way to Théâtre
de l'Ancienne Cage à Pigeons before 9 a.m.

The classroom for apprentice actresses was located on the second floor,
and Jenna passed by the manager's office on her way.

The door remained tightly shut, indicating that Maipú Meyer hadn't
arrived at the theater yet.

*Could he have really fled?* Jenna averted her gaze and
continued forward.

Shortly thereafter, she walked past the locked door of the exclusive
break room belonging to the popular leading actress, Charlotte Calvino.

The door was locked as well.

Jenna exhaled quietly, straightened her posture, and turned into the
classroom.

She was late. Gaspar, the instructor for today's first acting class, had
already arrived and was busy addressing a private question from one of
the apprentices.

Gaspar, despite being a middle-aged man of dignified demeanor, had the
ability to portray a charming playboy on stage.

†

Deep within Underground Trier, nestled within a hollow strewn with
remnants of tree branches and vines...

The very center had collapsed, leaving the soil in a state of disarray.
Faint marks, as if from hurried footsteps, led towards an unknown
destination.

Angoulême de François followed the path indicated by the cardinals and
found himself standing at the precipice, his eyes fixed on the
bewildering sight before him.

Those filthy rodents had relocated once more!

In response to the signal from the cardinals, Angoulême unsheathed a
golden longsword that appeared to be forged from condensed light from a
grayish-white mechanical doll.

With a swift motion, the sword plunged into the ground, causing the
bluish-green and withered branches and vines to erupt into flames. Yet,
no trace of black smoke ascended.

As the fiery shroud dissipated, the true nature of the ground, walls,
and ceiling came into view for Angoulême and his companions.

A multitude of serpents, slimy and cold, writhed and entwined, engaging
in frenzied mating rituals. Countless gray rats tore at each other
relentlessly, refusing to retreat until death claimed them. Diverse
insects devoured leaves and soil with such voracity that they burst open
from overindulgence...

†

As the realization dawned upon Franca that the plainclothes police had
covertly sealed off Théâtre de l'Ancienne Cage à Pigeons, she swiftly
withdrew from the brick-red three-story edifice and sought refuge in a
nearby side alley. From her concealed vantage point, she observed the
situation unfolding on the second floor.

As the first acting lesson neared its end, Jenna couldn't help but
notice the conspicuous absence of Maipú Meyer, who typically lingered by
the classroom door.

Just then, a group of black-uniformed police officers entered, clutching
lists in their hands.

The leader called for a momentary pause in the lecture and addressed the
assembled individuals.

"Maipú Meyer has been confirmed as a heinous heretic. We must ascertain
your faith."

Gasps and exclamations erupted, momentarily plunging the scene into
disarray.

"Silence!" bellowed the leading officer. "I shall read out your names,
and you will sign this pledge as a witness before God. No one shall
deceive."

*Ascertaining of faith...* Jenna's racing heart found a measure
of solace.

One by one, the teachers and apprentice actresses stepped forward,
receiving a pledge form from one of the police officers. They diligently
completed their declarations of faith, appending their signatures to
solidify their commitment.

Before long, Jenna heard her own name being called.

"Celia Bello."

She approached with composure, collecting a pledge form and a scarlet
fountain pen.

The contents of the pledge were as follows:

"I solemnly swear that my faith in the \_\_\_\_ remains unyielding to
this day.

"Affirmer: \_\_\_\_

"Notary: \_\_\_\_

Jenna filled in the first two blanks with "Eternal Blazing Sun" and
"Celia Bello" respectively before returning the completed pledge and the
fountain pen to the police.

Once all the actors and apprentices had signed the pledge, they were
instructed to remain confined within the classroom, rehearsal room, and
other designated areas until further notice, unable to venture beyond
those confines.

†

Within the manager's office that had previously been occupied by Maipú
Meyer, a gathering took place to collect the signed pledges.

Several devout members of the Eternal Blazing Sun Church, known as
Beyonders, took turns wielding a fountain pen crafted from pure gold.
With deliberate strokes, they inscribed the initials "D.E." in the
designated Notary space.

The ink they used appeared to be a vivid shade of crimson, reminiscent
of fresh blood.

Upon the completion of each pledge, a shimmering golden aura would
briefly envelop the document before dissipating back to its original
state.

Every so often, a pledge would emit an ominous, blood-red glow,
accompanied by piercing screams emanating from the same floor.

Even those actors and apprentices who employed aliases, long-established
pseudonyms recognized by those in their midst, possessed mystical
connections that were intricately intertwined.

Auberge du Coq Doré, Room 504.

Charlie lay restless in bed, his weariness unable to lull him into
sleep.

All of a sudden, a knock echoed through the room.

"Who's there?" Charlie called out, startled, as he sat up in bed,
resembling a startled bird.

"Angoulême de François." The voice from beyond the door was deep, yet
carried a compelling warmth.

Charlie's mind immediately conjured the image of the Monsieur who had
interrogated him about Madame Alice's demise. Hastily, he rose from his
bed and swung the door open.

Standing before him were Angoulême, with his blond hair, golden brows,
and beard, and Imre, whose brown skin and full lips bore the traces of
Southern Continent heritage.

"What brings you here, Monsieur François?" Charlie inquired cautiously.

Simultaneously, a thought flashed across his mind.

*Could these be the official Beyonders whom Ciel and Red Boots
mentioned?*

Angoulême did not immediately respond. He stepped into Charlie's room,
gesturing for Imre to shut the wooden door behind them.

Casting a sweeping glance around, he finally spoke.

"I bring bad news. Susanna Mattise is not entirely deceased. She may
appear before you at any time in the future."

Charlie couldn't conceal his disappointment, pain, confusion, and fear.

"What should I do?"

Angoulême nodded gently.

"But there is good news as well. We intend to offer you a clerical
position within our ranks. This will provide you with enhanced
protection.

"Your monthly salary will amount to 320 verl d'or, and there will be a
confidentiality agreement in place as compensation. For the initial one
or two months, you will need to undergo an Intisian improvement course.
Consider it an internship period, with a stipend of 200 verl d'or. Once
you successfully pass the assessment, you will become a full-time
employee.

"Are you willing? We do not wish to force this proposal upon you."

*320 verl d'or per month? And improved protection? *These words
echoed within Charlie's mind. He believed that no ordinary person could
turn down such a remarkable opportunity.

He was satisfied even with his current job as an attendant, which earned
him 80 verl d'or monthly!

Recalling the hints dropped by Lumian and Franca, Charlie responded with
surprise and delight, "Absolutely no problem!"

†

By the window of Room 207, Lumian positioned himself in front of a
wooden table, observing Charlie as he followed the two strangers towards
Avenue du Marché.

He focused his attention, seeking any changes in Charlie's luck, but
found none.

This meant that the two individuals were not Actors manipulating the
situation!

Lumian's gaze then shifted to the blond man, intrigued to discover what
kind of fortune the official Beyonder possessed.

Suddenly, an intense wave of danger washed over him. He instinctively
crouched down, reducing his profile.

Angoulême turned his head, his eyes filled with confusion, as he looked
at the Auberge du Coq Doré's windows.

He sensed that someone was observing him.
