## Chapter 1169: Assistance

Amon's monocle radiated a dazzling light.

He vanished from behind the enormous cross within the Chaos Sea,
wandering the astral world to roam into the deep black void just two
lunar distances away from the Tenebrous World.

At that moment, the golden Buddha had also been caught in the
indiscriminate explosion of desires triggered by Farbauti and the Master
of the Shadow Cottage. However, fortune was on His side; the desire
occupying His thoughts was primarily one of "universal salvation and
relief from suffering." As a result, He only froze momentarily before
becoming even more fervent in His participation in the battle. In His
hands, He conjured a massive tricolor wheel of mercury, lapis lazuli,
and deep black, inscribed with complex patterns and symbols.

Amidst the grand sermon-like chanting, a nearly formless River of Fate
emerged, drawn into the enormous divine wheel, which began to turn
toward a particular symbol.

This River of Fate belonged to Inextinguishable Ravings!

Under its influence, Inextinguishable Ravings, who had been cursed to
have a rabbit's consciousness and spirit, could not free Himself from
the pitch-black fiend, found Himself unable to escape. It was as though
destiny itself had entangled Him there, forcing Him to endure even
fiercer curse damage as blood-colored flames ignited Him.

Even for these great existences, fate retained its mysterious power!

This caused all sentient beings in the current star dominion to
experience chaotic consciousness and disoriented spirits. The
disturbance gradually spread outward to other star dominions, weakening
as it extended until it eventually dissipated.

Inextinguishable Ravings, the symbol of consciousness and spirit!

Meanwhile, on the other side, the High-Dimensional Overseer in a higher
dimension, along with the Celestial Master and the Celestial Thearch's
projection trapped within the dimensional painting, were not fully
consumed by the explosion of desires. They only entered a brief state of
stagnation.

Amon raised both hands, bringing forth a tiny illusory figure wrapped in
layers of bandages, thorns, and roses, allowing it to float before Him.

The Chained Uniqueness.

Gazing at the Uniqueness, Amon keenly sensed its profound mystical
connection with the Tenebrous World and the Mother Tree of Desire. He
prepared to use the authority of the Error pathway to elevate this
connection into one akin to that between an avatar and its true body, or
oneself and oneself---allowing the damage and consequences to be
transmitted to the Mother Tree of Desire.

Amon tilted His head and glanced toward the direction of the Chaos Sea.
Clicking His tongue, He gently shook His head.

To Him, the apocalypse had to end in victory. Even if most of the
sefirot were lost, and civilization continued on the peripheral planet
at the universe's edge, it would merely be a comforting
delusion---possibly just a temporary postponement of the apocalypse.

This was because the victory of the Great Old Dominators did not signify
the end but symbolized a seismic shift in the cosmic landscape. After
seizing the sefirot They desired, would They not accommodate them? Once
accommodated, powerful entities comparable to the Pillars would emerge!

By then, if the Circle of Inevitability accommodated the Key of Light,
Amon Himself would no longer dare leave the planet and could only
survive tenuously under the protection of the Lord of Mysteries.

Given the premise of failure, this was the optimal outcome. If the
Mother Goddess of Depravity were to mend and recover, allowing Her to
fulfill the contract and aid the Primordial God Almighty's return, even
the Lord of Mysteries would face a crisis.

These two capable and willing Pillars could sign a contract through the
Notary pathway, cooperating sincerely enough to dismantle and seal the
Lord of Mysteries, ensuring the Celestial Worthy could never resurrect!

In such a scenario, Lord of Mysteries Klein might not be able to win but
could perhaps avoid destruction. However, the peripheral planet at the
universe's edge would be left entirely unprotected.

Amon retracted His gaze and looked at the Chained Uniqueness before Him,
chuckling softly. "Only I steal from others. When have others ever dared
rob me?"

Before His voice faded, Amon's monocle emitted an even more dazzling
brilliance.

This transformed the surrounding void into light, ushering in a white
day.

___

Lord of Mysteries Klein was just about to wield the symbolism of
Foolishness against the Goddess of Fate when he suddenly dissolved into
shadows, sinking back into the River of Fate's main current and
tributaries. He returned to his strategy of interference, obstruction,
and delay.

This was because he had agreed to Amon's request to use the Uniquenesses
of the Error and Door pathways.

It was also because he had received corresponding information from the
spirit world and decided to shift his primary focus to the Mother Tree
of Desire.

The grotesque, chaotic tree adorned with scales of chaos had been
blinded to spiritual premonitions, unable to gather information from the
spirit world. Thus, She remained unaware of the developments on another
battlefield---until She saw the many Kleins rise into the air, spreading
their arms to project starlight-dyed bluish-black doors before them.
Only then did a sense of foreboding strike Her.

Klein had reinforced the mystical connections and corresponding
symbolisms that Amon had "reconstructed," linking them across countless
star dominions to the current battlefield!

Before the Mother Tree of Desire could respond, the familiar roaring of
Inextinguishable Ravings reverberated through Her psyche, wreaking havoc
on Her consciousness and spirit.

Then, blood-colored flames engulfed Her, and She let out a howl of pain.
Her massive arboreal body began collapsing, morphing into a giant rabbit
with scales of chaos.

Klein had anticipated a similar scenario but had not expected the Mother
Tree of Desire to be so severely injured. Just as he could not foresee
the instability of the pitch-black fiend's emotional state, which had
exploded at the slightest provocation.

As he prepared to seize the opportunity to seal or even slay the Mother
Tree of Desire, the chaos-scaled rabbit erupted with ferocious
aggression and greed.

She exploited the cursed mystical connection against Herself,
unabashedly releasing the gathered forces to drag Herself toward the
Tenebrous World battlefield!

The Mother Tree of Desire vanished into the astral world, bypassing
Klein's attempts to block Her.

Every event has both a good side and a bad side; this was a fundamental
rule of the universe, and the reverse was equally true.

Klein's marionettes raised their coats and extended their right hands
into the void, attempting to Graft the mystical connection between the
Mother Tree of Desire and the Tenebrous World onto one of the
marionettes, hoping to return the rabbit with scales of chaos without
Her realizing it.

At that moment, crimson moonlight descended, and an illusory, slightly
damaged oak tree grew from the mystical connection between the Mother
Tree of Desire and the Tenebrous World, solidifying the corresponding
symbolism.

Klein's attempt to Graft failed.

Mother Goddess of Depravity!

The Mother Goddess of Depravity had assisted the Mother Tree of Desire
remotely!

Klein was both surprised and unsurprised.

He was unsurprised because he had long known that the Mother Goddess of
Depravity and the Mother Tree of Desire had signed a contract witnessed
by the Primordial God Almighty. The latter had sacrificed the Tree of
Shadows to help the former bypass barriers. The former now owed
assistance, which She could provide by exerting influence remotely from
the astral world through the corresponding contract.

What surprised Klein was the speed at which the Mother Goddess of
Depravity had recovered, having reset Her state and healed Her injuries
faster than he had anticipated, no longer worried about Lumian's
influence. Though She still needed to remove the suppression of the
symbolism of destruction to fully heal, She was already daring enough to
intervene in the battlefield remotely---a true testament to Her
symbolism of New Life.

Naturally, the Mother Goddess of Depravity was still weakened from using
the Chaos Primogenitor's special symbolism. Until She was fully healed,
She would not descend directly while bearing dual negative impacts.

With this interference, Klein failed to stop the Mother Tree of Desire.
The massive rabbit with scales of chaos leapt from the astral world to
the burning Tenebrous World.

Weakened and desperate, She let out a resounding roar, awakening the
survival instincts of all sentient beings in the region.

In an instant, the golden Buddha turned and fled far away. Amon,
clutching the Chained Uniqueness, wandered back behind the enormous
cross in the Chaos Sea. The High-Dimensional Overseer, along with the
Celestial Master and the Celestial Thearch's projection, also chose to
retreat for a moment.

Within the Tenebrous World, the heavily cursed Inextinguishable Ravings
developed certain thoughts and emotions.

His current state was dire...

Among the Great Old Dominators, there were still some who could
accommodate His associated sefirah...

A weakened hunter could become prey...

Driven by His overwhelming survival instincts, Inextinguishable Ravings
instinctively fled the Tenebrous World, attempting to return to
formlessness and escape to another star dominion to hide.

Without interference from the golden Buddha, His attempt succeeded.

At this moment in the Tenebrous World, the consciousness and spirits of
the Dao integrators had already been utterly consumed, likewise for
Farbauti. The Mother Tree of Desire seized the opportunity, using Her
powers of convergence to forcibly absorb the shadowy world.

Then, in Her form as a colossal rabbit, She hugged the Tenebrous World
and fled into the astral world without any hesitation, leaving
everything else behind.

Severely injured, She no longer cared about recovering the Chained or
Abyss Uniquenesses or their corresponding Beyonder characteristics. All
She desired was to hide and recover while fully accommodating the
Tenebrous World!

Everything had happened so quickly that by the time the Mother Tree of
Desire disappeared from the star dominion, the efforts of Origins of
Disaster Lumian and Eternal Darkness Amanises to block Her had just
arrived. Klein, whose form had been flickering due to the interference
of the Mother Goddess of Depravity, finally stabilized and reappeared.

Klein instantly assessed the overall situation and realized that despite
the temporary loss of the Tenebrous World, His side had gained the upper
hand---the three sefirot needed to deal with one Great Old Dominator.

However, vigilance was still required. Inextinguishable Ravings, despite
fleeing in a burst of survival instincts, might surreptitiously return
to observe the situation. If Klein's side had not gained a decisive
advantage by then, He might rejoin the battle. Thus, time was of the
essence.

Klein planned to continue delaying the Goddess of Fate and Supernova
Dominator while pursuing the Mother Tree of Desire. He aimed to reclaim
the Tenebrous World while She was still severely damaged and had yet to
fully hide. Meanwhile, He would occasionally interfere with the Circle
of Inevitability to create opportunities for Lumian and the Evernight
Goddess.

The next moment, His high-frequency flickering figure stopped. He
directed his gaze toward the Chaos Sea.

Crimson moonlight fell from the astral world, bathing the enormous
luminous figure, bringing New Life to all consciousnesses.

This included Grisha Adam, as well as Herabergen and Leodoro---and also
that of the Primordial God Almighty.

The Primordial God Almighty's consciousness was already on the verge of
taking over.
