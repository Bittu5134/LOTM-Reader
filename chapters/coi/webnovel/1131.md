## Chapter 1131: Individual Preparations

As 0-17 stepped out of the solitary door standing on the ruins, its
figure was abruptly erased and entered directly into the special mirror
world.

Meanwhile, the Great Old Dominators who constantly monitored changes in
the astral barrier began to react.

Stars of various colors---scarlet, gold, brown, blue, and orange---lit
up simultaneously, banishing the darkness and crimson in the sky. Their
presence infused it with other hues and emitted creaking sounds.

Soon after, the crimson moonlight that seemed to shine from an unknown
source brightened and grew viscous, as if filled with blood.

From within Leonard's body, segmented Worms of Time crawled out one
after another. These worms assembled in front of him, forming the image
of an elderly man with neatly combed white hair, deep brown eyes, a
sombre demeanor, and a face largely free of wrinkles.

The man, clad in an asymmetrical black robe, was none other than the
Angel of Time Pallez Zoroast from the Church of the Fool.

The moment Pallez appeared, He immediately addressed Leonard, "Go
support the other Major Arcana card holders in the mirror world. Leave
this to me."

Without hesitation, The Star Leonard nodded and slightly parted his
lips.

An intangible spirit extended from one of his teeth, growing enormous
and enveloping him entirely. It carried him into the mirror world.

The next second, as if the void itself had been torn open, two figures
emerged from the spirit world.

At first glance, these figures resembled grotesque trees covered in a
viscous black fluid. Upon closer inspection, they were massive,
distorted human forms with twisted and terrifying arms sprouting from
their bodies. These arms bore sinister features---bulging veins with
crimson eyeballs, embedded skulls, tongues lined with sharp teeth, and
other unimaginable horrors. The figures exuded an overwhelming aura of
madness and malevolence. They were none other than the Rose School of
Thought's indulgence faction's two Abominations: Suah and Tirié.

Compared to when They previously aided in the growth of the Tree of
Shadow beneath Trier, They had undergone noticeable changes.

Suah's belly was grotesquely swollen as if He were pregnant. However,
the fetus remained still, seemingly cursed and already a stillborn.

Tirié's body, coated in tar-like fluid, was covered with dark,
tumor-like growths resembling mammary glands. These tumors continuously
split open and closed, secreting black milk.

When the Great Mother descended to the ground, even under the protection
of the Mother Tree of Desire through the astral barrier, Suah and Tirié
could not entirely escape corruption and became pregnant several times.

Yet, for beings like Suah and Tirié, madness was intrinsic. As long as
the children weren't born, a little extra corruption didn't matter
much---it merely caused Their faction members and worshipers to die in
more grotesque ways or mutate into monsters more frequently.

As an Archangel of the Error pathway and a noble from the Fourth Epoch
who had lived for over two millennia, Pallez Zoroast had seen much. Even
so, He couldn't suppress a frown at the sight, and His abdomen seemed to
ache in phantom pain.

Beside Him, the Angel of the Holy Spirit Reinette of the Church of the
Fool stepped out of the spirit world. She had just placed four blonde,
red-eyed heads back onto Her neck.

The leader of the Rose School of Thought's temperance faction
transformed into a massive doll the size of a castle. Her blood-red eyes
shone beneath a black Gothic dress entwined with sinister vines and
countless mysterious symbols.

She revealed Her Mythical Creature form.

On Pallez Zoroast's other side, atop the ruins of a building covered in
green plants, The Hermit Cattleya, wearing a purple robe and no longer
donning her heavy glasses, returned from a non-existent state to
reality.

She had initially intended to invite Queen Mystic Bernadette to
participate in this operation to increase their chances of success.
However, given the limited number of Angels remaining in the protected
zone of Trier, the reduction in their forces would have been
unacceptable.

When The Star Leonard arrived at the depths of the mirror world, where
The Sun Derrick, Two of Cups Franca, and others were battling the
Demonesses of Unaging, the area was already in shambles, as though it
had suffered a partial collapse and destruction.

Demoness of Black Clarice wore a crystalline queen's crown on her head.
Beneath its translucent surface were miniature visions of hurricanes,
volcanic eruptions, falling meteors, and other disasters, resembling a
complex, mystical weather bottle. The crown's pinnacle was stained
crimson, radiating the light of the crimson moon.

This crown, named "Calamity of Crimson," was a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact
originating from the remains of the Demoness of Blue.

The holy and dignified Demoness of White Katarina had already raised her
left hand. A glass ring encircled her middle finger, extending a sharp
crystalline spike.

This was "Love's Dread," a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact belonging to the
Demoness Sect, corresponding to a Demoness of Catastrophe.

Wearing a cyan hunting outfit, Yalenna, with thick, long eyebrows, had
an unusual black rooster perched on her shoulder. Though it seemed
carved from stone, it appeared alive.

Its most distinctive feature was its three heads---a crestless one, a
brightly crested one, and one with a dark red crest---and a slightly
parted shared beak that revealed sharp teeth.

This was "The Setting Sun Rooster," another Grade 0 Sealed Artifact held
by the Demoness Sect.

When the crimson moon descended, the Demoness Sect's headquarters
suffered significant losses, retaining only five Grade 0 Sealed
Artifacts. After recovering the Demoness of Blue's Beyonder
characteristic, they now had six.

Currently, these artifacts were wielded by the Demonesses of Black,
White, Cyan, Gold, Crimson, and Orange, among whom two had nearly killed
Franca moments earlier.

Only through her status as a Demoness of Unaging, her numerous Mirror
Substitutions, and having merged with her mirror self through
reconciliation, did Franca survive the first wave of attacks and await
reinforcements.

Silver, Green, and Brown were Demonesses who had advanced after the
crimson moon descended. They replaced the titles of the completely
deceased and lacked the qualifications to wield a Grade 0 Sealed
Artifact. They could only use Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts that synergized
with them.

The colored Demonesses, who had already digested the Unaging potion,
couldn't use the Calamity of Crimson and Love's Dread to advance due to
their inability to complete the ritual. They could only use them as
Sealed Artifacts.

Facing such overwhelming forces, The Star Leonard drew a black staff
embedded with gemstones from his Traveler's Bag.

0-62, Staff of the Stars!

It was bestowed by Mr. Fool prior to the current events with added
seals.

The moment he gripped the Staff of the Stars, Leonard allowed his
thoughts to scatter and emptied his mind.

The Sun Derrick donned a crown that seemed to coalesce from dawn's
light. Its ancient design exuded splendor, majesty, pride, and
resilience.

This was "The Proof of Glory," a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact belonging to
the City of Silver, once worn by the ancient god, Giant King Aurmir!

It had originally been used to seal the Gift of the Land. Not long ago,
Mr. Fool had temporarily sealed the latter, enabling it to be lent out.

The holy and glorious light gathered more and more, forming a pure and
solid barrier in the front and around. This both protected the
companions and prevented the targets from escaping.

Madam Judgment, Xio Derecha, had just spent nearly a year filled with
chaos digesting the Chaos Hunter potion. She had not yet had the chance
to complete the ritual to advance to a neighboring pathway, Duke of
Entropy, but this did not stop her from using the severely asymmetrical
black-and-gold mask that caused discomfort upon sight.

She placed this Solomon's Mask on her face.

She and Franca would alternate in assisting Mr. Sun in utilizing the
Proof of Glory---this Grade 0 Sealed Artifact required two Saints to
wield.

The Moon Emlyn had already received the Sequence 1 Beauty Goddess
Beyonder characteristic of the Moon pathway, along with the separated
Sequence 2 Life-Giver Beyonder characteristic, bestowed by Ancestor
Lilith. However, he did not dare to take the former out of the protected
zones, fearing it might provoke an abnormal reaction from the Great
Mother and introduce unknown risks.

He used his Life-Giver Beyonder characteristic as collateral to borrow a
Grade 0 Sealed Artifact, the "Robe of Divine Blood," from the treasury
of the Sanguine. He now had it draped over himself.

Madam Temperance Sharron held a three-layer jewelry box in her hands,
its surface silver-black and embedded with various gemstones.

This was 0-61---Box of the Great Old Ones---borrowed from the Abraham
family through Madam Magician.

This Sealed Artifact would randomly cause its holder to disappear, die
suddenly, or undergo aberration. To counter this, Madam Temperance
Sharron specifically visited the Angel of Fate Will before the operation
and received His blessing.

Will was currently in the protected zone in the Southern Continent,
maintaining stability and eliminating anomalies alongside Azik and other
Angels. While He could not leave, granting blessings posed no issue.

Not only Madam Temperance Sharron but also The Star Leonard and the
other participants in this operation received blessings from Will and a
miracle from Mr. Fool to reduce the likelihood of negative random
effects.

Magicians didn't perform unprepared.

The Hanged Man Alger held a thin brass book and the Card of Blasphemy,
Tyrant.

The former was 0-02---Trunsoest Brass Book!

Having received assistance, Franca finally recovered. From the
Traveler's Bag Lumian had entrusted to her earlier, she retrieved an
ancient book bound in parchment: Post-Apocalyptic Scripture!

For this operation, every participating Saint from the Tarot Club
carried a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact.

At this moment, a figure passed by, seemingly slow yet incredibly fast.

It was a woman who appeared to be in her forties, still stunningly
beautiful and exuding charm, radiating an aura of maternal brilliance.

Upon seeing this figure, The Moon Emlyn's gaze froze instantly.

It was Roland, the former Matriarch of the Church of Earth Mother!

Roland appeared normal, her upper body bare, but numerous bird-clawed
infants hung from her chest, covering the pale skin and constantly
drawing nourishment.

She wore a faint smile, radiating crimson moonlight, as She passed
through the battlefield and walked toward the special mirror world.
