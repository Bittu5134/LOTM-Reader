## Chapter 788: Realizations

Seeing the Magic Mirror Divination come to an end, Lumian turned his
gaze to Anthony.

"The Newins has definitely fled. Go out and gather information from the
pirates. Find out if Great Shark Jörg and the key crew members managed
to board the ship. If they didn't, find out where they are now."

"Understood." Anthony knew Lumian wanted to quickly determine the
whereabouts of Great Shark Jörg and his men to see if they could use
them to "visit" the Newins again and learn about the elves and the true
nature of the Lost Newins.

Lumian couldn't go himself; the pirates would avoid him, and even if he
forced the information out of them, it would alert Great Shark Jörg and
his men if they were still in Banamo Port, making them hide deeper.
Disguising himself wouldn't work either; the pirates wouldn't be
friendly or forthcoming.

The same applied to Franca.

Only Anthony, who had befriended many pirates, could naturally obtain
the needed intel.

After watching Anthony leave the room, Franca sat down at the desk with
a sigh and said, "This whole transmigration thing keeps getting more
complicated."

"You used to treat it too simply," Lumian scoffed.

Franca didn't argue, staying silent for a moment before changing the
subject.

"I've fully digested the Pleasure potion. After a few days of rest, I'll
be ready to attempt the Demoness of Affliction ritual."

"Honestly, it feels like a dream. Have I really digested it?"

She still seemed somewhat incredulous.

Lumian chuckled in response.

"What else were you expecting? If Admiral Deep Sea knew our main goal
was to help you digest the Pleasure potion, he'd think the world was
absurd. He'd wonder if it was necessary and suggest that with a Demoness
of Pleasure's conditions, we could have just asked for his help with a
notarized agreement to prevent harm, and he'd happily assist."

"It's just hard for me to accept..." Franca muttered. "And I know what
you mean. In our world, plenty would say, 'Helping a Demoness of
Pleasure digest a potion is too wicked---please let me help,' but that's
superficial pleasure and low-quality digestion. Real pleasure comes from
experiencing it in pain and sinking into it. Targeting people like Moran
Avigny and Howl Constantine aligns more with the essence of the Demoness
path."

Lumian was just joking and didn't continue the topic.

Franca was silent for a while, then looked at Lumian and carefully said,
"About your plan to spread a plague among the pirates in Banamo Port---I
don't think it's viable."

"Why?" Lumian raised an eyebrow, amused.

Franca straightened, her gaze unwavering.

"I don't think we can completely separate the guilty pirates from
innocent bystanders. The plague would inevitably affect the latter,
causing them to die in despair."

Lumian chuckled. "It was just a concept, a direction. We can refine the
plan to address those concerns, and if it's not feasible, we can abandon
it. We can't limit our thinking right from the start.

"For example, by then, I might be a demigod and find a high-level
replacement for the Bottle of Fiction, capable of containing all of
Banamo Port with conditions allowing only pirates to enter or exit."

"No," Franca shook her head. "There are adventurers who moonlight as
pirates, and many of them haven't committed crimes deserving death."

Lumian smiled and sighed.

"Then we'll collaborate with the Aurora Order or find a Sequence 5
artifact from the Broker path to identify guilty targets."

Franca seriously thought for a moment.

"That won't work either. We have our own crimes. Many adventurers have
killed pirates. Does that count as guilty?"

Lumian was momentarily speechless, then laughed.

"You really are suited for switching to Provoker.

"I was just raising examples; my point being that a plan shouldn't be
dismissed outright. We need to analyze its feasibility and consider
future changes."

"Okay." Franca expressed her opinion and sighed quietly.

After some thought, she decided to speak frankly to Lumian, "Since
discovering Project Vortex, you've become more aggressive, like when you
first came to Trier. Or is it the Devil's Whispers from Hisoka that's
constantly stirring your malice? The Traveler's Bag only mitigates its
influence; it doesn't completely eliminate the negative effects."

Lumian chuckled, somewhat self-deprecatingly. "It's a bit of both."

He then grew serious.

"But more importantly, I've come to some realizations."

"What realizations?" Franca asked, puzzled.

Lumian nodded. "I was going to remind you anyway. You've been a Demoness
for a long time. Haven't you noticed the inherent nature of this
pathway?"

Franca fell silent.

Lumian continued in a low voice. "Like the Hunter pathway, it inevitably
brings catastrophe and calamity. We are destined to belong to darkness
and represent destruction.

"Think about it. What's the general perception of Hunters and Demonesses
among Beyonders? Danger. Hunters are seen as bloody dangers, and
Demonesses as evil dangers. We can't escape this impression, nor can we
deny it.

"The subsequent potion digestion and advancement rituals will push us
deeper into darkness unless you choose to stop advancing and remain
where you are. Otherwise, we'll face challenges that test our very
souls.

"You could consider switching paths, but your only option would be the
Hunter pathway."

Seeing Franca's expression change but still remaining silent, Lumian
suddenly laughed.

"What I'm trying to say is, give up on purity; don't shy away from
darkness and evil. We need to confront these things. Only then can we
find ways to avoid evil and discover the light within the darkness. We
will all be tainted by darkness.

"We are stained black; we must strive not to fall, not to betray our
inner principles."

Franca was silent for a while before sighing deeply.

"Affliction and Despair give me bad premonitions. But walking in
darkness, seeking light within it---won't we be corrupted bit by bit and
eventually fall completely?"

Lumian chuckled. "Do we have any other choice? We can only keep fighting
our own darkness and evil until we die."

Franca tersely acknowledged his words and expressed her thoughts,
"Actually, all Beyonders are like this. The paths of gods are inherently
dangerous and inevitably lead to madness. Hunters and Demonesses just
make it more obvious and direct."

She couldn't imagine the struggles and pain if she had chosen the Devil
pathway.

When the negative effects of Jenna's Decency brooch wore off, Anthony
returned and briefed Lumian and the others on the current situation in
Banamo Port.

The Newins had indeed fled, and Great Shark Jörg and his men hadn't
boarded and were now missing.

In the following two days, Lumian and his team disguised themselves and
searched Banamo Port for the first mate, second mate, and boatswain of
the Newins. However, they found no significant leads, whether through
social investigation or mystical tracking. Instead, they discovered some
suspected associates of Admiral Deep Sea had also disappeared.

Lumian suspected Great Shark Jörg and his men had left Banamo Port
through some secret means. Whether they returned to the Newins remained
unknown.

In Trier, in an apartment in Quartier de la Cathédrale Commémorative.

Angoulême de François set up a ritual and summoned the messenger of the
Seven of Cups.

He saw a rabbit-shaped Spirit Body emerge from the flames, dressed in an
odd manner: a miniature silk top hat between its ears, tiny gold-rimmed
glasses on its nose, a black trench coat clearly not meant for a rabbit,
and holding an iron-black revolver sized for a large rabbit.

*The messenger of Hidden Blade is quite cute, with a unique style... Who
knew she would dress her messenger like this...* Angoulême
picked up the prewritten letter and handed it to the adorably dressed
rabbit messenger.

The rabbit gave him a cold, sharp glance.

*Um...* Angoulême retracted his previous thoughts.

In one of the motel rooms rented by Lumian and company in Banamo Harbor,
Franca read Angoulême's letter and said with some difficulty, "007 has a
lead on the Mirror People and wants us to follow up, but we still
haven't found Great Shark Jörg."

She was more interested in the secrets of the elves than the Mirror
People.

Lumian leaned back, relaxed, and said, "The worst-case scenario is that
Great Shark Jörg and his men have already returned to the Newins through
secret means. We won't get any results staying here.

"So, let's leave. Once the alert is lifted, those people might come out.
Meanwhile, we can make long-term plans to keep an eye on Banamo Port.
Maybe the Newins will return for supplies."

"Agreed," Franca accepted reality.

At that moment, Jenna noticed a problem: Rabbit Chasel was still in the
room.

She hadn't paid it for delivering the message.
