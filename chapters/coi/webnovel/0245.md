## Chapter 245: "Speech"

All eyes turned towards Hugues Artois, the distinguished member of
parliament, his prominent nose and graying temples giving him an air of
refinement. He had quickly regained his composure and wore a smile as he
spoke.

"There's no need to fret. If the assailant possessed the means to breach
two layers of defense and confront me directly, there would be no reason
to go through the trouble of assassinating Tybalt. This seems more like
an act of blackmail, a surface-level threat."

The four members of the campaign present nodded simultaneously, coming
to the conclusion that Monsieur Member of Parliament's deduction was
accurate.

Hugues Artois turned to the lady with red hair.

"Cassandra, my knowledge of mysticism is limited. I have only heard that
Beyonders can extract the truth from a deceased soul through spirit
channeling. Will Tybalt's spirit betray us?"

Cassandra, with her red hair flowing, slowly shook her head.

"Under normal circumstances, we would have to take the risk of cleansing
the situation. However, in the recent attack, the assassin clearly took
ample time to obliterate Tybalt's spirit, thereby concealing his own
identity. It's equivalent to assisting us."

Hugues Artois nodded slightly and cast a glance at the two anxious
secretaries. With a smile, he reassured them.

"Rhône, Margaret, fear not. Time is on our side, and the future lies
within our grasp. A minor setback will not hinder the ultimate outcome.

"You must always believe that our actions represent justice."

Rhône, donning gold-rimmed spectacles, and the refined Margaret were
bewildered. They couldn't fathom being associated with the concept of
"justice."

Not only them, but even Cassandra with her red hair and the middle-aged,
muscular Boduva looked at Hugues Artois in confusion, sensing they might
have misheard.

Cautiously, Hugues Artois glanced towards the door, silently questioning
if anyone might be eavesdropping.

After the red-haired Cassandra nodded, he launched into an impromptu
speech.

"Ladies and gentlemen, while I may not possess the ability to convert
and pray for a boon due to a binding contract, I have acquired a
profound understanding of our world.

"You, better than anyone, should be aware that the vast cosmos above us
represents an expansive universe. Countless planets exist within it,
each akin to its own world. Many of these worlds harbor their own
civilizations. The world we inhabit is but one among an endless expanse,
as insignificant as a speck of dust.

"The seven deities have imprisoned us in this realm, preventing us from
making contact with the civilizations that thrive in the universe. They
desire our blindness and deafness, seeking to keep us enslaved for
generations.

"They label these magnificent beings as evil gods. They weave
falsehoods, warning us of the peril that lies in believing in these evil
gods. Their goal is to prevent us from making contact with these higher
civilizations, to keep us confined.

"If the belief in an evil god were genuinely dangerous, why do numerous
civilizations in the universe, comprising different species, still
exist?

"They are afraid. If these mighty entities were to descend upon our
world, They alone would face destruction. Only the Saints, Angels, and
fanatics who follow Them would be affected. For most people, it would
merely be a shift in faith, devoid of peril.

"Believing in one of the seven deities is deemed faith, but believing in
other great beings is not?

"We can no longer remain captive to the seven deities. We must venture
forth into the future of humankind and the course of civilization. From
the mere fact that boons can be obtained, these great beings are
mightier than the seven deities. They will bestow protection and
willingly offer their power. Their divine benevolence is boundless, akin
to the vast sea.

"In the days to come, when we navigate the universe and reflect upon the
journey we have undertaken, you shall come to comprehend that our cause
is one of justice.

"In this process, death is an inevitability, yet those who perish are
deserving. They are either aged, feeble, unlucky, or destined to meet
such a fate. Most of the blame does not lie with us.

"Furthermore, they constitute only a minority. We cannot impede the
majority from seeking refuge with a higher civilization, pursuing a
better future.

"Ladies and gentlemen, sacrifices are inherent in any cause. As long as
we steadfastly believe that our actions are driven by justice and
persist unwaveringly, the future shall unquestionably be ours!

"In a decade's time, humanity will secure a ticket to join the circle of
cosmic civilization. We shall no longer be barbarians, hiding in the
shadows of obscurity!"

The red-haired Cassandra, Secretary Rhône, and the rest were left
dumbfounded.

Who was the true believer of the evil god?

Each had their own reasons for following different evil gods, and deep
down, they knew they had veered onto the wrong path. Nevertheless, they
had already set foot on this journey and had no choice but to press
forward. Thus, they either used faith as a facade to gradually reshape
their understanding, or they completely surrendered themselves, seeking
any motivation to propel them onward.

And yet, Hugues Artois, someone who clearly wasn't a believer and hadn't
received any favors or undergone significant assimilation, managed to
speak such astonishing and captivating words straight from the depths of
his heart.

The four members of the campaign were taken aback, realizing the sense
behind Hugues Artois' words, causing them to reevaluate the meaning
behind their past actions.

After a few moments, the red-haired Cassandra let out a slow exhale. She
looked at Hugues Artois and sincerely praised him.

"An exceptional speech, Monsieur Member of Parliament. In the future,
when you choose your faith, I can recommend one for you."

"Oh?" Hugues Artois inquired in a nasal voice.

Cassandra smiled and elaborated.

"Among the boons bestowed by that individual is one called Orator."

Hugues Artois nodded and flashed a relaxed smile towards the four
members of the team.

"Do not be disheartened by Tybalt's demise. We will remain steadfast in
our original plan."

Cassandra, Rhône, Margaret, and Boduva responded in unison.

"Yes, Monsieur Member of Parliament."

In the depths of Underground Trier.

Lumian took a detour and returned to the quarry cave. Swiftly, he shed
his clothes and shoes, removing the wig and beard that concealed his
true appearance.

Once he changed back into his ragged tramp attire and adorned a
dark-blue cap, semi-translucent crimson Fire Ravens materialized around
him.

The Fire Ravens darted out, alighting upon the cane, shirt, bow tie,
wig, and other objects, causing them to erupt in soft explosions of
flame.

Lumian, having turned his back, proceeded towards the exit of
Underground Trier. Crimson flames surged in his wake, consuming
everything related to the previous attack, casting an illuminating glow
within the dark cavern below.

Around midnight, in the depths of the Eternal Blazing Sun Inquisition
beneath Église Saint-Robert.

Angoulême de François, engrossed in perusing the investigation records,
heard a knock on his office door.

His brown coat, adorned with two rows of golden buttons, hung neatly on
a coat rack near the entrance. He wore a light golden shirt featuring
the emblem of the Sun Sacred Order, along with dark brown pants.

"Please, come in," Angoulême calmly invited.

Valentine, powdered hair and face adorned with subtle makeup, entered
the room.

He had been preoccupied with thoughts of Cordu all this time. Upon
learning of survivors appearing in the Trier region, he had submitted an
application and transferred to this post. His wife and child had long
yearned for the bustling city of Trier, so they eagerly moved with him
without much persuasion.

He was on night duty with a few teammates and happened to encounter the
murder of the member of parliament's assistant secretary.

Valentine, clad in a slim blue tweed coat with a golden brooch, took a
seat across from Angoulême and spoke directly.

"Deacon, why haven't we investigated Hugues Artois?

"While most members of the Aurora Order may be crazy, they possess an
uncanny ability to detect heretics. Although not every person they
target is a believer in the evil gods, at least 70% are.

"Considering the information we've gathered, we can reasonably conclude
that Tybalt Jacques, who met his demise tonight, was a heretic and
wielded the power of decay. Furthermore, he served as Hugues Artois's
assistant secretary.

"We cannot allow a highly suspicious individual to continue serving as a
member of parliament. Investigating him is not only a responsibility to
the people of the market district, but also to Hugues Artois himself. If
we find no evidence of wrongdoing, we can assist him in purging any
heretics surrounding him."

Angoulême hadn't anticipated his new team leader to be more devout and
zealous than himself. He couldn't help but raise his hand and furrow his
brows.

With a bitter smile, he responded.

"Perhaps you are unaware, but every member of parliament has signed a
contract with the two Churches and received a notarized contract.

"In this contract, they pledge their faith, display their abilities and
associated sources. The two Churches promise not to restrict the
personal freedom of any member of parliament or their key staff without
substantial and compelling evidence. They won't be subject to the
influence of Beyonders.

"This is to safeguard the authority of the National Convention.

"According to the contract, Hugues Artois believes fervently in the
mighty Eternal Blazing Sun and is not a Beyonder.

"Hence, you may question him and his core staff, but that is the extent
of it."

Valentine couldn't conceal his disappointment.

"Why is such a contract in place?"

"It is a byproduct of the past coup d'état, a change that accompanied
the course of history," Angoulême provided a simple explanation.

Valentine let out a sigh, rose from his seat, and extended his arms.

"Praise the Sun!"

"Praise the Sun!" Angoulême stood up and returned the gesture, watching
his subordinate exit the office.

Quartier de Noël, Holy Palace Hospital.

Jenna sat upon a small stool, slumped beside her mother Elodie's lightly
slumbering form in the hospital bed.

After bidding farewell to Franca and sending her brother Julien home,
who had to attend to his factory duties come dawn, Jenna found herself
alone. The Théâtre de l'Ancienne Cage à Pigeons had yet to resume its
acting training, as plans were underway to auction it, along with
Auberge du Coq Doré, at the police headquarters. However, the recent
explosion at the Goodville Chemical Factory had caused a delay in those
proceedings.

Suddenly, Elodie stirred. Jenna startled awake, her eyes fixating on her
mother, who gradually opened her own.

Elodie's gaze mirrored the face of her daughter as she mustered a smile.

"I thought I was about to see your father."

Without awaiting Jenna's reply, Elodie inquired, her voice frail, "How
are my injuries?"

Jenna, overjoyed to witness her mother awaken from her coma, beamed
genuinely and responded, "They're not severe. Look, no surgery is
required."

Elodie heaved a sigh of relief and nodded slowly.

Still recovering from her coma, her body and mind weren't yet in their
prime state. After a brief exchange, she drifted back into slumber.

Jenna clasped her mother's hand and beheld the contentment that graced
the wrinkled, gray-haired countenance beneath the gentle illumination
streaming in from the window.

Observing for a while longer, she glanced upward and caught sight of the
first rays of dawn gradually painting the sky with light.
