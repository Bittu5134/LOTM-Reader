## Chapter 654: Bounty

*Louis Berry is back again?* Camus's forehead twitched at the
mention of the "straw hat guy."

Since encountering the adventurer, his life had taken a tumultuous turn.
First, he had "captured" the murderer in a serial killing case, then he
unearthed clues related to a four-year-old case. Subsequently, the
suspect had emerged, attempting to harm him and Kolobo, throwing the
patrol team into chaos.

And now, Louis Berry was making another appearance?

Camus felt the weight on his chest, and his heart raced.

"Where is Louis Berry?" Reaza was already familiar with Camus's account.

The patrol team member who had brought the report hastily answered,
"Sitting in the hall."

Reaza nodded, and he and Camus left the office, descending the stairs.

As they walked, Camus gradually snapped out of his daze.

He recalled Louis Berry's suspicions about Twanaku the previous day, how
he had abandoned his theories without delving into specifics, and how
the adventurer had sought him out early in the morning, hoping to gather
information indirectly. Shortly after Kolobo handed over Twanaku's
information, the latter had been attacked, leading to a fierce battle.

*Did Louis Berry employ such a cautious inquiry to avoid triggering the
Devil's Danger Premonition? Was buying information from Kolobo a trap
targeting Twanaku? No, hadn't Twanaku sensed the corresponding danger?
He could only sense it a minute or two in advance, and would it be too
late by the time he discovered it?* As a former Sheriff and now
an Interrogator, Camus swiftly made connections and speculations.

He believed that Louis Berry had likely identified Twanaku after
learning about his preference for sugarless Fermo coffee. He hinted at
suspicions regarding the police headquarters but refrained from going
into specifics, fearing that Twanaku might foresee danger!

As for how Louis Berry set a trap for Twanaku without detection, Camus
couldn't puzzle it out for now.

Furthermore, he suspected that Louis Berry's operation hadn't been
entirely successful. There were no signs from the Matani Import and
Export Shop indicating Twanaku's demise.

This was a Sequence 5 Desire Apostle, wielding the power of a Sequence 5
Wraith. Unless a demigod personally intervened, they might require two
or three battle teams of Mid-Sequence Beyonders from pathways like Sun
and Warrior to handle him. Alternatively, they needed to mobilize
Beyonders at the level of a Sequence 5 Pirate Admiral, armed with potent
mystical items.

Soon, Camus and Reaza spotted Louis Berry seated on the sofa in the
hall's guest area, his golden straw hat standing out in the sunlight.

"Monsieur Louis Berry, what brings you here again?" Camus inquired in
deep Intisian.

Louis Berry gave Camus a deep look before smiling and addressing Reaza
in fluent Dutanese, "I'm here to collect the bounty."

As he spoke, he retrieved Twanaku's head from his Traveler's Bag.

Camus and Reaza observed the blood-stained face, the head with the
broken horn, the vacant eyes, and the gruesome wound on the bridge of
the nose, along with ten to twenty deep cuts.

Despite the severe damage, Camus, a former Sheriff, recognized the owner
at a glance.

Twanaku Tupián!

*He succeeded? Had he truly set a trap for a Desire Apostle and managed
to defeat him?* Camus's gaze shifted up, scrutinizing Louis
Berry, a young man with the title of a great adventurer in the Fog Sea.

Such strength could rival any Pirate Admiral in the Five Seas!

Of course, this assessment applied only to individual abilities,
excluding the subordinates of Pirate Admirals.

Reaza silently ascertained from a spiritual level. He turned to Camus
and asked in Dutanese,

"Is it Twanaku?"

"Yes," Camus confirmed, sighing inwardly.

The battle between Twanaku and Louis Berry had been fierce, resulting in
his tragic demise. Not only were his eyes absent, but he was also
covered in wounds, displaying signs of Devilification.

Reaza looked at Lumian and pondered for a moment before speaking in
Dutanese, "I wonder if you've seen Twanaku's wanted poster. The bounty
is only 70,000 verl d'or."

Back then, the bounty was set based on the criteria of a Serial Killer.
It was only increased by 20,000 because this particular Serial Killer
targeted Beyonders.

Lumian barely understood and switched to Intisian with a smile.

"If I wait two days to collect the bounty, will I be able to get more?"

Upon hearing this, Camus pondered for a moment and realized the validity
of the statement.

In two days, their wanted posters would depict Desire Apostle and Wraith
Twanaku, who had caused the deaths of several members of the patrol
team, not the Serial Killer from the past!

Of course, with Matani's financial resources, it was impossible to
significantly raise the bounty. At most, they could double it and report
the danger to the Church of Earth Mother, the Eternal Blazing Sun
Church, and other official organizations in the Northern Continent to
see if they would be willing to increase the bounty.

After Camus translated Lumian's words into Dutanese, Reaza remained
silent, unsure of how to respond.

For the patrol team, 70,000 to 80,000 verl d'or was a substantial sum!

Without waiting for a response, Lumian added with a smile, "But there's
no need to add to the bounty. Just fulfill two of my requests. Two
simple ones."

"What are they?" Reaza asked in a deep voice after hearing Camus's
translation.

Lumian chuckled in response, stating, "Firstly, I want to see all the
dossiers related to Tizamo Town. Secondly, I'm very curious about
Twanaku's card and want to take a look. Of course, I'll just take a
look."

"You want to investigate last year's incident in Tizamo Town? Isn't your
sole purpose in Port Pylos to find Twanaku?" Camus asked, puzzled.

Lumian chuckled.

"Need I remind you? Twanaku's hometown is Tizamo Town."

*Wh---* Camus suddenly felt that the matter with Twanaku
wouldn't conclude with the other party's death. There were still many
secrets hidden behind it.

Louis Berry had mentioned this from the beginning.

After translating their conversation for Reaza, Camus sensed that the
patrol team's previous investigation of the Tizamo Town incident might
have concluded too hastily.

Eyeing Louis Berry, who had successfully taken down a Desire Apostle
wielding Wraith powers, the chilly Reaza fell silent for a few seconds
before uttering, "Who tasked you with looking into Twanaku?"

Without giving a direct response, Lumian inquired, "Did he declare
himself a member of the temperance faction, a follower of The Fool?"

"It's not a self-proclamation. We verified it," Reaza confidently
replied after hearing Camus's translation.

*As anticipated...* Just making confirmation, Lumian stood up
for the Church of The Fool, stating,* *"Traitors can surface in
any organization, and there'll be individuals with hidden agendas
attempting to infiltrate."

"That's indeed our problem," Camus sincerely concluded. "We shouldn't
solely rely on the organization they're affiliated with to determine a
person's character or whether they can be recruited. We also need to
observe their words and actions."

After careful consideration, Reaza agreed to Lumian's request.

While assigning another patrol team member to aid Lumian in the process
and collect the bounty, he instructed Camus to show Lumian the poker
card.

___

In the cold and silent underground corridor, Camus gazed at Lumian and
cautiously asked, "What are you investigating?"

This had already led to the death of a Sequence 5 Desire Apostle!

Lumian emitted a soft chuckle.

"It's dangerous to know too much."

Camus fell silent, wisely choosing not to inquire further, drawing from
past experiences.

As Lumian advanced, he casually asked, "How many members of the patrol
team perished this time?"

"Four. All under Twanaku's control." Camus gave a self-deprecating
smile. "We'll be recruiting new members before the end of the year.
They're fortunate. Those with suitable pathways don't have to worry
about subsequent Sequence potions. If they aren't from the correct
pathways, they can use Sealed Artifacts."

This was how the resources of an official organization gradually
accumulated.

Lumian nodded slightly.

"How's Kolobo?"

Camus's smile grew more relaxed.

"He's fine. He's almost healed."

As they conversed, they arrived at a room adorned with cold bones. A
metallic poker card lay on the table in the middle.

"Be careful. It will burrow into your body and control you like a
Wraith," Camus warned.

Lumian nodded slightly and approached, reaching out for the card with
the ten of spades on its face.

A bone-like sensation entered his mind, accompanied by a chilling cold.

Lumian's right hand quickly became encased in a layer of frost.

The frost rapidly crystallized and extended towards his arm.

Simultaneously, the card's surface underwent a transformation, revealing
a grayish-white joker.

It rapidly etherealized, poised to merge with Lumian's body.

Silently, Lumian's arm burst into brilliant white flames. With a swift
flick of his palm, he accurately pressed his thumb onto the poker card
that hadn't completely dissipated, right onto the joker's face.

The poker card fell into silence.

Frost detached from Lumian's arm, descended to the ground, and melted
into water.

*Zombie's Frost, Wraith's Possession... This is really a mystical item
from the Prisoner pathway...* Lumian swiftly made a basic
assessment.

However, the transformation abilities displayed by the poker cards
didn't align with his understanding of the Prisoner pathway. Instead,
they resembled superficial applications of a Faceless.

*Could it be corruption brought about by the Celestial Worthy? Also,
when the temperance faction provides resources, it's impossible to
directly give Wraith. They start from low Sequences and work their way
up... Did this poker card strengthen time and time again? Does Hisoka
have a permanent Artisan collaborator?* Lumian withdrew his gaze
from the poker card and slowly retreated to Camus's side.

"I'm done," he thought for a moment and said, "Be careful when using
this item."

Camus nodded.

"We'll treat it as a Sealed Artifact rather than a mystical item."

Upon returning to the surface, Camus gathered all the dossiers related
to Tizamo Town.

Lumian sorted through the items and picked up one of them.
