## Chapter 155: Jenna

The circumstances of Wilson's rapid recovery were riddled with
uncertainty. Lumian toyed with the idea that it was the work of a
Sequence 8 "Doctor" from the Planter pathway, or a Sequence 9
"Apothecary" from its namesake pathway. Yet, his heart clung to the hope
of unmasking Madame Pualis and her subordinates.

Had he pieced together the puzzle sooner, and had Wilson and his crew
not gone far off into the distance, Lumian would have thrown himself
from the moving public carriage, hot on their trail. He envisioned
wrangling Wilson into some clandestine quarry cave, pressing him for
answers about his miraculous recuperation.

If this saga bore no link to the evil god that Madame Pualis revered,
Lumian was prepared to swallow his pride and apologize to Wilson, who,
in turn, would owe Lumian his life for not permanently silencing him.

But, to snuff him out was also on the table. The ball was in Lumian's
court.

As the carriage came to a halt at its station, Lumian was the first to
alight, retracing his steps to the alley where Wilson and his crew had
disappeared.

No barricades existed here. It was a bustling place, with people
constantly coming and going. Wilson and his gang hadn't left any clear
trail. Lumian devoted a painstaking quarter of an hour to trying to
discern any signs of them, finally admitting defeat.

But he wasn't beaten down. Wilson may have slipped through his fingers,
but there were others like Will or Williamson. The Poison Spur Mob was a
hydra of sorts, with a plethora of leaders just a notch above Wilson.
Each had their own turf, their own dealings. They could run, but they
couldn't hide. Lumian just needed patience. Sooner or later, he'd cross
paths with one or two of them. And they, undoubtedly, were more
intimately involved with the shadowy forces pulling the strings behind
the Poison Spur Mob than Wilson. They knew more!

*Phew...* Exhaling a deep breath, Lumian wrestled his impatience
into submission, deciding to lay low and watch for a while before
concocting a hunting strategy.

If the Poison Spur Mob truly was entwined with the evil god that Madame
Pualis worshiped, then the leaders on par with Margot were either
Sequence 8s, endowed with Beyonder characteristics, or they were spawn
of an evil god, gifted with boons akin to a Sequence 8 Beyonder. They
could even be stronger. If Lumian didn't arm himself with enough intel
and set an appropriate snare, he was likely to end up on the losing
side.

*I can't forget I'm a Hunter, just because I've become a
Provoker.* Chiding himself, Lumian slipped down Avenue du Marché
and strolled into the Salle de Bal Brise.

Given it was barely past three in the afternoon, the place was
practically deserted. No music played, no one danced. His eyes
immediately found Louis, the thug, nursing a glass of pomegranate ale at
the bar counter.

"Soda?" Lumian grinned, sauntering over. "How about drinking something
an adult would drink?"

Louis swiveled, meeting Ciel's amiable smile draped over the bar
counter.

The sight left him momentarily stunned, as if he couldn't quite place
the young man before him.

Was this the same Ciel who masked his wild ruthlessness behind a
constant grin, one who'd resort to violence over the slightest
disagreement?

He seemed more like a greenhorn, a naïve country boy who had just been
roped into the Savoie Mob.

Louis gave his soda a wistful swirl, a bitter smile tugging at his lips.

"I've got to be at the baron's side later. Can't afford to get sloshed."

Lumian's eyes flicked to the bruised knot on Louis' forehead, a chuckle
bubbling up. He pointed at his forehead, commenting, "Still nursing that
bump? How long's it been?

"I ran into Wilson earlier. After I broke his arm and tossed him from
the fourth floor, you'd think he'd be worse for wear. But he looked
perfectly fine."

Louis was taken aback.

"You're saying Wilson's back on his feet?"

"Seems so, at least on the surface. Wanted to say hello, but he
hightailed it out of there too fast." Lumian's tone carried a hint of
regret.

*Say hello? More like you want to rough up Wilson again and not even
give the guy a chance to hea*l, Louis thought, but he didn't
dare voice it.

His face took on a grave cast as he muttered to himself, "When we
clashed with the Poison Spur Mob in the past, their wounded always
bounced back in just a few days. The baron thinks they've got some
Beyonders with a knack for healing. But for someone like Wilson to
recover so rapidly from such serious injuries... that's unheard of."

"Could it be because you guys have never managed to put a serious dent
in any of the Poison Spur Mob members?" Lumian's voice was laced with
mockery.

Louis pondered, then conceded, "There have been a few, but not many.
Plus, we usually don't see them again for a good long while. By then,
they're all healed up."

So, Wilson's recovery outpaces even Doctor and Apothecary Beyonder
powers? Lumian managed to glean a crucial tidbit from Louis's words.

Although it could point to a higher Sequence Beyonder on the
corresponding pathway, it at least narrowed down some possibilities for
him.

Just as Lumian was gearing up to probe the progress on gathering
concoction ingredients, a stunning figure swept into the room.

A woman, ostentatiously attired, with her chestnut hair tied up, loose
tendrils framing her ears, cheeks, and falling down her back.

Her face was dusted with powder, black eyeliner accentuating her blue
eyes, lending them a deep, decadent allure.

At present, she was decked out in a bold red dress that left little to
the imagination, sequins catching the light at strategic spots.

*Isn't this the chanteuse known for her bawdy songs at the Poison Spur
Mob's Salle de Gristmill? *Lumian did a double take.

This was the Savoie Mob's Salle de Bal Brise!

Still, Lumian couldn't be entirely sure if it was the same woman. The
singer had a mole by her lips, while this woman sported one at the
corner of her left eye.

"Catching your eye, is she? That 'Little Minx'?" Louis followed Lumian's
gaze.

Lumian chuckled. "How about we use a more respectful moniker? Manners
matter."

"You sound just like the baron sometimes," Louis mused. "Her stage name
is 'Little Minx', 'Little Minx' Jenna. She's known as a 'Showy Diva'."

"And what exactly is a 'Showy Diva'?" Lumian didn't attempt to cover up
his ignorance. After all, he was a newcomer to Trier, straight out of a
backwater like Cordu.

Louis took a moment to recall the baron's words and then delivered
smoothly, "It's all about her performance style, her acting, her
flamboyant outfits. She's a standout singer."

*She's a chanteuse too?* Lumian probed, "She performs at the
Salle de Gristmill as well?"

"Sure does. As long as she's getting paid, she'll belt out tunes in any
dance hall on Rue Anarchie." As Louis spoke, "Little Minx" Jenna
sauntered over.

Her blue eyes roamed the room, lingering on Lumian before moving to
Louis.

"Ten songs, four verl d'or. I'll keep a third of the tips thrown on
stage."

"Deal." Louis had the baron's approval.

*Only 4 verl d'or for a night's performance?* Lumian found
himself questioning. Had he overpaid Osta Trul?

In unfamiliar territory, he was woefully out of touch with the going
rates.

Spotting his lingering gaze, Jenna swiveled her head, flashing him a
grin.

"Feel free to let your eyes wander a bit lower."

She was referencing her scantily clad chest.

For Lumian, whose only exposure to such scenarios was through novels,
this was uncharted territory. Yet, his face betrayed no unease. Flashing
a smile, he said,

"I was merely wondering. The last time I spotted you, your mole was by
your lips. Now it's nestled by your eye."

Jenna's reply came in the form of a captivating smile, which made Louis
swallow hard.

"Are you from out of town?" Jenna queried.

Lumian bobbed his head in affirmation.

With a playful grin, Jenna leaned in, a finger tracing her cheek as she
softly elucidated,

"It's all the rage here in Trier. Ladies often sport a faux mole. Right
in the middle of the cheek for elegance, smack in the middle of the nose
for audacity, at the corners of the eyes for passion, by the lips for
allure, and nestled in the décolletage for secrets..."

As she spoke, she sent Lumian a saucy wink, as if to say, "Today, I'm
all about passion."

*Ah, Trier..*. Lumian could only shake his head in amazement.

Given their proximity, the intoxicating blend of Jenna's natural scent
and the heady perfume she wore invaded his senses.

This led Lumian to instinctively rub his nose.

Jenna's reaction was immediate.

"Don't tell me you still have your virginity? I'm not a street girl, but
for you, I might make an exception."

She took a moment to appraise Lumian, seemingly pleased with what she
saw.

*Virginity? Something that magically returns every morning at 6
a.m.?* Lumian scoffed inwardly, his smile nonchalant.

"Right now? I'm afraid you might miss your performance tonight."

Back at the Ol' Tavern in Cordu Village, Lumian often had to match the
locals in their coarseness, else he'd become the butt of their jokes.

Jenna's response was a hearty laugh and a dismissive wave of her hand.

"I'll find you after my set tonight."

With that, she sauntered off towards the modest wooden stage at the
front of the dance floor, keen to get a feel for the place.

*Isn't she jumping the gun a bit? Where's the agreement on a time and
place?* Lumian mused to himself.

She was clearly just yanking his chain!

Louis chimed in, a tinge of envy coloring his voice, "Don't fall for her
act. She gets a kick out of toying with good-looking men. She won't
actually follow through.

"I reckon she's Franca's sweetheart."

"Franca, 'Red Boots' Franca?" Lumian's surprise was palpable.

"Red Boots" Franca was a key figure in the Savoie Mob, ruling over Rue
des Blouses Blanches, and rumored to be a woman.

"Exactly," Louis affirmed. "Franca appears to be the Boss's mistress,
but she seems to swing both ways. She and 'Little Minx' are thick as
thieves."

*A lover's lover...* Lumian once again marveled at the
peculiarities of Trier.

Louis watched Jenna, now swaying gracefully on the stage, a look of
longing etched on his face.

"She wasn't this mesmerizing when she first arrived in the market
district. Over the past couple of years, she's become more adept at
presentation, more feminine. What a shame..."

"If you manage to climb the ranks and stand toe to toe with Red Boots,
you might have a shot," Lumian teased, stoking Louis's ambition. He then
shifted gears, "Any luck tracking down those three items I needed?"

Louis tore his gaze away from Jenna to respond, "I was just about to
tell you, we've managed to gather them all."

"That quick?" Lumian was taken aback by the Savoie Mob's efficiency.

*Why not start a factory? Why stick with the mob life?*

Louis elaborated, "'Rat' Christo keeps a variety of critters, some rare,
some less so. Some we could take off his hands for the right price.
That's how we got the lizard's eye and the snake's venom sac. The
eagle's nest rock was a bonus."

*"Rat" Christo, the one in charge of smuggling?* Lumian mulled
over this newfound information.
