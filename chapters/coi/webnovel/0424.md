## Chapter 424: Underground Maze

*Albus Medici...* Lumian repeated the name to himself, glancing
at the member of the Iron and Blood Cross Order who had suddenly
appeared.

During Gardner Martin's gathering, Albus had never revealed his last
name, and Gardner Martin had never introduced him. Now, he had actually
given his full name to Poufer Sauron.

*Is he trying to make it more realistic?* Lumian's gaze swept
across Albus's face, and he realized that when Count Poufer mentioned
the surname Medici, he didn't hide his mockery at all, as if mocking the
Sauron family member.

"Ciel Dubois," Lumian extended his right hand and politely introduced
himself.

Albus casually shook his hand, a smile evident in his eyes.

He said, "I've heard your name before, a generous patron of art."

The member of the Iron and Blood Cross Order emphasized "generous."

"That's mainly thanks to my sponsor," Lumian said with a double
entendre.

In the ears of the other guests, he was referring to his father---his
wealthy family. As a member of the Iron and Blood Cross Order, Albus
caught the subtle message.

Poufer Sauron exchanged a few pleasantries with Lumian before escorting
him to the sofa.

The gathering was intimate, with familiar faces all around, including
Poufer's cousin, Elros, Novelist Anori, Painter Mullen, Critic Ernst
Young, and Poet Iraeta.

After some casual conversation and nibbling on snacks accompanied by
black tea, Count Poufer glanced around and suggested with a mischievous
smile, "How about we embark on an adventure today?"

"Adventure?" Albus raised an eyebrow and couldn't resist a playful quip,
"An adventure in the bedroom?"

His insinuation was clear. Red Swan Castle might be spacious, with room
for a key family member and even hundreds of soldiers at its zenith, but
it hardly seemed like a place fit for adventure. Were they supposed to
reenact a Trier-like adventure under a bedroom's plush sheets?

The jest lightened the atmosphere, and Poufer Sauron cleared his throat
before continuing,

"Perhaps you're unaware, but Red Swan Castle harbors an extensive
underground area.

"In the era of its construction, its primary function was war. It had to
boast a cavernous cellar and a tunnel for escape during dire situations,
or it would be deemed inadequate.

"Throughout the centuries, my forebears expanded and modified the
underground, turning it into a labyrinth resembling something out of a
horror story. Even though I grew up in Red Swan Castle, my knowledge of
that place is limited to the areas I frequently use.

"Our objective today is to venture deep into this subterranean maze and
locate a Count's crown that one of my ancestors misplaced in one of its
chambers. The crown is adorned with numerous rubies, making it easily
distinguishable.

"The one who retrieves the Count's crown will be crowned today's king."

*Deep into the underground maze...* Scenes suddenly flashed
through Lumian's mind.

*The constant self-mutilating people in Red Swan Castle...*

*Screams of unknown origin...*

*A bronze coffin, surrounded by countless white candles...*

*A palm with dark-red, nearly-black blood vessels...*

And a withered, black heart with a trickle of crimson seeping out...

These latter objects seemed to be concealed somewhere in the depths of
the underground hall!

In an instant, Lumian comprehended the gravity of Poufer Sauron's
proposal.

Poufer Sauron's probing was here!

Suppressing the urge to scan his surroundings and possibly catch a
glimpse of Gardner Martin, who might be lurking, Lumian turned his
attention to Albus Medici.

The member of the Iron and Blood Cross Order clicked his tongue and
chuckled.

"Sounds intriguing. This is a game for the courageous!"

As if to quell any doubts or reluctance among the group, doing so meant:
Those who decline to participate are merely cowards!

Count Poufer seized the opportunity to reassure them, "Worry not. If you
lose your way and cannot find your path back, just pull the bell rope in
your chamber. The servants will be dispatched to search for you and
bring you back from below."

"No problem," Anori, the short and plump novelist, quipped with a
mischievous glint in his eye. "I'm quite looking forward to something
happening. After all, it will provide me with excellent material for my
writing."

"Like Anori's Last Day?" Lumian joked.

Having attended numerous gatherings hosted by the Black Cat art
organization, Lumian was well aware of Novelist Anori and Poet Iraeta's
unique quirks. Anori had a taboo for never praising fellow authors,
while Iraeta's ire was only stirred by the current social realities in
Intis.

Anori took a sip of his black tea and mumbled, "Those old fogeys from
the Intis Faculty of Arts will absolutely love this theme."

Seeing no objections, Count Poufer rose from his seat and addressed the
assembled guests,

"Let's divide into two groups and begin this adventure. We'll set out
individually along the way.

"One group will follow me, and the other will accompany Ciel. These
individuals have all been kings in the past three months.

"Those willing to join Ciel, raise your hands."

"Me!" Albus Medici was the first to raise his hand. Lumian had expected
him to follow Poufer Sauron closely to complete the Iron and Blood Cross
Order's mission.

Count Poufer appeared unfazed, as if this was the anticipated course of
events.

The second to raise her hand was Elros, the cousin of the host.

With her long auburn hair, soft features, and bright brown eyes, she
smiled at Lumian and said, "I've always been Monsieur Ciel's companion
in the past. I see no reason to change that now."

Lumian nodded and returned her smile.

He was aware that beneath her youthful appearance, Elros possessed a
complexity that belied her innocence.

In one of his unsettling dreams, most participants in the King's Pie
game had descended into madness, inflicting self-harm or harm on others.
Only three individuals remained unaffected: Lumian himself, Poufer
Sauron, and Miss Elros.

Lumian couldn't help but wonder about her true motivations for choosing
to accompany him into the underground maze.

The third to raise his hand was the poet, Iraeta.

Holding his cherrywood pipe, he offered a straightforward reason, "He's
my sponsor!"

The remaining guests, including Novelist Anori, Painter Mullen, and
Critic Ernst Young, formed a team with Poufer Sauron.

They left the comfort of the living room and found themselves standing
next to a fully-armored statue. Descending the nearby stairs, designed
for two people to walk side by side, they ventured further into the
depths of the castle.

The walls of the staircase were mottled and grayish-white, winding their
way down into the bowels of the earth. The surroundings grew
increasingly quiet as they descended.

After traversing about three floors, Lumian and his group reached the
entrance of the underground maze.

The passageways were illuminated by numerous wall lamps, some connected
to gas pipes, while others had a more classical design with candles
burning brightly.

Lumian gazed up at the ceiling and noticed the aqueous-black stone
bricks above, shrouded in darkness. Their cracks were distinct, and the
surface exhibited signs of peeling.

"Let's choose this one," Poufer declared, taking a carbide lamp from the
wall and leading his team down the leftmost passageway.

After setting up the carbide lamp, Lumian instinctively proceeded down
the corridor ahead without hesitation.

He believed that in such an environment, methodical searching might
cause them to overlook something significant. By relying on the
convergence of Beyonder characteristics and the concealed Blood Emperor
aura, he believed he would stumble upon something of value.

"What's your reason for choosing this path?" Albus Medici's expression
was always a little annoying.

Lumian responded with a hint of nonchalance, "I have faith in fate."

"I like that reason," Elros chimed in with a faint smile.

Poet Iraeta took a puff from his cherrywood pipe and added, "I believe
in it too, but only if fate is inclined to favor me."

The quartet ventured deeper into the corridor, encountering what
appeared to be storage rooms along the way.

Soon, they arrived at a dimly lit hall with three doors, each bearing a
single word in ancient Feysac: Hope, Death, and Madness.

Lumian had abandoned deep thinking by this point. Without hesitation, he
walked towards the Door of Madness and gently pushed it open.

As the door swung ajar, darkness enveloped the room, and the light from
the carbide lamp spilled in, revealing an eerie sight. Lifelike wax
statues stood throughout the room, both men and women, adorned in either
ordinary or exquisite attire, their expressions twisted in agony.

"Not bad," Albus commented, disdainfully patting a wax statue's face
with his right hand.

Elros glanced at him.

"Didn't your mother teach you manners?"

Albus chuckled.

"I don't have a mother."

Elros was momentarily taken aback, not quite sure how to respond to that
statement.

In the background, Poet Iraeta spoke with a touch of admiration, "In the
past, when rumors circulated about me having an affair with a widow, I'd
quietly spread gossip that I had kidnapped the Member of Parliament's
daughter and was suspected of murdering a merchant. I even found myself
entangled in rumors involving human meat pies, and my neighbors
mysteriously vanished.

"As long as I don't care about my reputation and actively tarnish it, no
one can perch on the moral high ground and point fingers at me."

*As expected of a poet...* Lumian praised inwardly. Holding the
carbide lamp, he led the way through the room filled with wax statues,
their goal being the exit at the far end.

The wax figures, illuminated by the dim yellowish light of the gas wall
lamps, appeared unnervingly lifelike. Their eyes seemed to follow Lumian
and his companions, creating an unsettling and bizarre atmosphere.

Lumian couldn't shake the memory of the previous wax statues that had
come to life and attacked. He couldn't help but feel that any of these
figures could suddenly spring to life and lunge at them.

Breaking the indescribable silence, Albus Medici

spoke in a relaxed tone, addressing Elros, "You're Poufer's cousin. Your
last name isn't Sauron, is it?"

Elros candidly admitted, "You're right."

Albus casually inquired, "Which family do you belong to?"

Elros turned her head to look at Albus Medici and then at Lumian. She
replied with a smile, "My full name is: Elros Einhorn."
