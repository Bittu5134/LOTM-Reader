## Chapter 228: Sudden Digestion

Upon Franca's mention of advancement, Lumian felt a sudden urge to make
preparations.

It wasn't that he didn't aspire to become a Sequence 7 Pyromaniac and
master mysticism techniques, but the Hunter and Provoker potion formulas
were bestowed upon him by Madam Magician, making them easily obtainable
and reducing the sense of urgency. His plan was to wait until the
Provoker potion had fully digested before writing a letter to Madam
Magician, inquiring about the price for obtaining everything necessary
for his advancement.

More importantly, Lumian knew that Madam Magician possessed a Pyromaniac
Beyonder characteristic.

But now that he thought about it, he felt that he had to make additional
preparations.

It occurred to him that Madam Magician might not be associated with the
Hunter pathway, which meant she might not possess the Pyromaniac potion
formula. Furthermore, she could have already given the Beyonder
characteristic to someone else. Lumian couldn't be the only one with the
Minor Arcana card, and it was unlikely that they all belonged to
different pathways.

While Madam Magician's level and abilities made it relatively easy for
her to acquire the Pyromaniac potion formula and its main ingredient,
she might be unwilling or face unforeseen delays.

Lost in thought, Lumian glanced at the wooden box resting on Franca's
lap and hesitated before suggesting, "Let's sell it."

The evil scythe possessed an uncanny sharpness and the ability to drain
an enemy's life through blood, perfectly suited to Lumian's
close-quarters combat style. However, it proved highly inconvenient to
carry and conceal due to its usage restrictions. Most of the time,
Lumian could only store it at Salle de Bal Brise or Auberge du Coq Doré,
relying on it when attacked. Alternatively, he could draw it in advance
and hide it in the cover of night shadows for offensive purposes.

If Lumian wished to have it with him at all times, his only solution was
to acquire a cello case and carry it on his back.

Yet, for a mobster leader, this would raise suspicions.

In fact, if Franca hadn't brought up the topic of preparing for his
advancement, Lumian would have deemed his current stash of 4,000 verl
d'or far from sufficient. He needed to acquire more funds. Keeping the
evil scythe, known as Harvest Sacrifice, wasn't a problem as it could
still prove useful in certain situations. If necessary, Lumian could use
the Mystery Prying Glasses to disguise himself as a musician, carrying
the cello on his back to assassinate his intended target.

Franca sighed in response.

"I suppose selling it is our only option. It's actually quite good, but
it doesn't suit my combat style."

She then gestured towards Lumian's waist.

"How about we each get a canister?"

To be honest, Franca wasn't particularly interested in the Berserk Agent
and the Bark Agent. She only desired the Scorpion Poison and the Healing
Agent. However, considering that Lumian also required poison for his
weapons and healing capabilities, she opted for a fair solution.

"Alright," Lumian agreed.

In the dead of the night, outside 126 Avenue du Marché:

A group of police officers, dressed in black uniforms, formed a
barricade to keep pedestrians away from the building behind them.

Within the house, Angoulême de François with his blond hair, eyebrows,
and beard, stood before a delicate female sculpture. His gaze fixed upon
the blood-red words adorning the wall.

Donning a row of golden buttons on his chest, he remained silent,
emanating an overwhelming sense of oppression that affected both the
surrounding Purifiers and police officers.

After a moment, the Purifier of Southern Continent descent emerged from
the basement and approached Angoulême. In hushed tones, he spoke,
"Deacon, we have found clear signs of sacrificial rituals to an evil god
beneath us. There are deceased individuals who were used as living
sacrifices."

"The prison cells have been unlocked, and some of the abductees managed
to escape. Those who remain informed me that 'Black Scorpion' Roger did
indeed employ sorcery."

Angoulême listened impassively, scanning his surroundings. He then
addressed the nearby police officers, saying, "Did none of you notice
the significant number of people who had gone missing?

"Who was it that claimed the market district housed only a handful of
controllable Beyonders? Who suggested that arresting them would only
pave the way for new criminal organizations, causing even greater
chaos?"

His voice, filled with anger, reverberated through the living room of
126 Avenue du Marché, causing each police officer to lower their gaze.

At that moment, Angoulême abruptly turned his attention to the delicate
female sculpture. He sensed a fleeting surge of anger emanating from it,
quickly dissipating.

He had sensed a faint fluctuation of anger there, but it disappeared in
a flash.

A golden light enveloped Angoulême's body as he extended his right palm,
opening the abdomen of the statue.

There, a cavity large enough to cradle a curled-up human revealed
itself. Within it rested a brownish-green seed, silently crumbling into
dust when stirred by the wind.

On the second floor of Salle de Bal Brise.

Lumian furrowed his brow abruptly.

"What's wrong?" Franca asked.

Lumian found himself torn between elation and confusion.

"My Provoker potion has fully digested.

"Could it be that some important figure was provoked by our actions?"

Franca speculated, "Perhaps Lady Moon, or maybe an official Beyonder?"

"All possibilities," Lumian conceded. If he couldn't unravel the
mystery, there was no use dwelling on it. After all, it was a positive
development.

This meant that he could now advance to become a Sequence 7 Pyromaniac!

This realization struck him with a newfound understanding.

He didn't need to meticulously summarize all the principles of acting to
fully digest the corresponding potion.

By summarizing a portion of his acting principles and consistently
receiving feedback while performing appropriately, he could rely on
quantity or the accumulation of time to digest the potion.

*Hence, most Beyonders can rely on time and fortunate encounters to
digest the potion without being familiar with the acting method...
*Lumian pondered silently, feeling enlightened.

After distributing the agents and deciding to sell the remaining spoils
for money, Lumian bid Franca farewell. Deliberately, he circled Salle de
Bal Brise before departing Avenue du Marché and returning to Auberge du
Coq Doré.

As he reached the second floor, he noticed that the door to Room 206
stood ajar, allowing the light from a carbide lamp to spill into the dim
corridor.

Curiosity piqued, Lumian glanced inside as he passed by, spotting
Gabriel seated by the bed in his preferred black dungarees, observing
the hallway outside.

"You're finally back!" the playwright exclaimed with delight upon seeing
Lumian.

Raising an eyebrow, Lumian queried, "You haven't been arrested by the
police yet?"

"..." Gabriel found himself momentarily speechless.

After a few seconds, his joy overcame him, and he replied, "Monsieur
Nathan Lopp didn't report me to the police. In fact, he signed a
contract with me and purchased my script.

"He intended to make a down payment of 1,500 verl d'or, but considering
how we frightened him, he deducted 500. Once the play commences, I'll
receive 2.5% of the ticket revenue for each show."

A soft chuckle escaped Lumian's lips.

"I thought the revolver had coerced him into agreement, fully expecting
him to go back on his word. I never imagined that your script would
genuinely move him."

*If you thought so, why did you still do it? *Gabriel grumbled
instinctively.

He elaborated, "Monsieur Lopp understands the idiosyncrasies of artists
and doesn't mind such matters. He mentioned that his previous mistress
was a female painter. She not only kept a sheep on his balcony but also
attempted to flirt with men. She even prepared fake props to try and
convince him, which ultimately led to their breakup."

"You Trieriens..." Lumian sighed, even as the Prankster King of Cordu.

Gabriel, hailing from a different province and not being a Trierien
himself, took Ciel's teasing in stride, unfazed by the remark.

He expressed his gratitude sincerely. "Thank you very much. Although I
don't agree with your approach, Monsieur Lopp would have never laid eyes
on my script without your help."

Gabriel, perplexed, questioned, "Monsieur Lopp mentioned that we authors
weren't cautious enough. We only covered our faces once we reached his
doorstep. After conversing with the guard at the lobby, he knew what we
looked like. Once he calls the police, there's no escape for any of us.

"Why didn't you mask up earlier when we tied up the guard?"

Gabriel believed that Ciel, being a mob leader, should have been more
cautious.

Lumian responded calmly, "Why should I have masked myself?"

"..." Confusion filled Gabriel's face as he asked, "Then why did you
eventually mask yourself?"

Lumian replied calmly, "Because Jenna masked up."

*What kind of logic is this...* Even as a playwright himself, he
found it difficult to comprehend Ciel's thoughts.

He could sense that Ciel's state last night was abnormal, but he didn't
know the exact reason. It was difficult to determine his mental state
and the motives behind his actions.

Gabriel let out a sigh and remarked, "Fortunately, things turned out
well. Otherwise, we would have been apprehended by the police..."

He paused for a moment, realizing that Ciel was a leader of the Savoie
Mob. The crimes he had committed in the past were more serious than what
happened last night. There was no need to fear. Even if the police came
looking for him, he could hide for a day or two, and the matter would
pass. No one would pursue him for such a trivial case.

Lumian chuckled and gave Gabriel's shoulder a friendly pat.

"Even if you get caught, you're just an accomplice. You didn't carry a
weapon. You can secure your release by posting bail."

With that, Lumian walked towards his room and opened the door to Room
207.

Gabriel watched Ciel's retreating figure, feeling a mixture of confusion
and relief.

In Room 207, Lumian carefully examined Fallen Mercury.

He felt that if the dirk wasn't repaired, it could last a maximum of
three months.

*Perhaps I should consult Franca. She might know a few individuals
skilled in the mending of mystical artifacts and Beyonder
weapons...* Lumian half-closed his eyes and established a
connection with Fallen Mercury, seeking communication.

After a while, he discerned the swapped fate that had taken place.

The destiny of "Black Scorpion" Roger gulping down alcohol.

Lumian carefully stored Fallen Mercury, stood up, and exited the room,
making his way to the third floor.

Approaching the door of Room 310, he overheard the lunatic's frantic
cries, still filled with fear.

"I'm dying, I'm dying!"

Lumian pulled out the short wire, unlocking the door. He then beheld the
lunatic crouched on the moonlit floor, clutching his head and trembling
uncontrollably.

Leaning against the door frame, Lumian couldn't help but let out a
chuckle.

"You're rather fortunate. The Montsouris ghost hasn't come to claim your
life just yet. I wonder if it's preoccupied or slacking off."
