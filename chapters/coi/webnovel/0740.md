## Chapter 740: Depriver

"Glutton?" Lumian said approvingly, "Quite the image."

Ludwig ignored Lumian's mockery and continued with the brief
introduction, "At this Sequence, hunger truly becomes ingrained in our
bodies, allowing us to evolve around it."

"What kinds of evolutions are there?" Lumian was concerned that Ludwig
would only mention this about Gluttons, just as he had described the
Tramp Sequence. Therefore, he took the initiative to inquire.

Ludwig paused for a few seconds to swallow his food.

Then, he stuffed a small piece of lemon cake into his mouth and replied
in a muffled manner,

"Internal organs that are better suited for digesting food and absorbing
energy. Stronger, more powerful teeth, a bite force and appetite that
exceed normal limits...

"This will help us obtain different abilities from food more
efficiently. We won't have to worry about being affected by the toxins,
viruses, and bacteria that food brings."

"In other words, even if it's highly toxic, as long as you consume it
with your mouth and treat it as food, you won't die from the poison?"
Lumian suddenly felt that Ludwig would make a suitable assistant for
Apothecaries.

Ludwig took a sip of milk and shook his head.

"We can't exceed a certain limit. Many Gluttons die from eating random
stuff."

*And you're not eating random stuff?* Lumian scoffed inwardly.

At the same time, he inwardly sighed.

This guy is quite honest. He's indeed like a child most of the time. He
actually forgot to protest that I had asked additional questions.

Ludwig set down the milk bottle and picked up a box of cookies.

Amidst the munching sounds, he continued, "The corresponding Sequence 7
is Gourmet.

"At this level, our digestion and eating abilities will improve further.
We can discern which ingredients are edible, which are inedible, which
ingredients can bring about special effects, and which ingredients need
to be combined with others."

Lumian thought seriously before asking, "Is extracting the corresponding
information from the consumed food one of a Gourmet's abilities?"

This ability had helped Lumian a great deal.

Ludwig, donning a thick yellow cotton nightcap, nodded obediently.
"Yes."

He didn't elaborate on the corresponding abilities.

"Although a Gourmet is useful, I can sense that at this Sequence, you
lack sufficient combat strength. Yes, perhaps Tramp will grant you a
certain level of street fighting abilities," Lumian commented from his
own perspective.

Ludwig didn't argue, nor did he bother to. How could delicacies already
in his mouth or subsequent delicacies be less important than what he was
talking about?

He peeled a lollipop and placed it in his mouth, a hint of enjoyment on
his face.

"Beyond that is what you call Sequence 6---Chef."

"I thought it was Bartender," Lumian teased.

Ludwig pondered seriously and said, "Chefs cover a wider range. It's not
like they can only make cocktails."

Lumian nodded pensively.

"Is a Chef's ability to use special ingredients to create mystical
dishes, pastries, drinks, and cocktails?"

Ludwig had displayed this ability numerous times.

Ludwig couldn't help but reveal a smug expression.

"That's right. Every Chef has different characteristics and abilities
due to the ingredients they've obtained and the food they've prepared.

"Chefs have one thing in common: they have excellent skills in
processing ingredients. This includes finding weaknesses and techniques
like cutting, chopping, and slicing."

*Only at this Sequence would one from the Gourmet pathway truly possess
combat strength... However, a Chef is similar to a Contractee. Their
actual combat strength depends on their synergy of abilities. The upper
limit is very high, and the lower limit is very low...* Lumian,
thinking of a Contractee, asked curiously, "Is there a limit to the
number of permanent effects a Chef can obtain through various mystical
foods?"

As for the negative effects, Lumian, who had eaten Ice Lemon Fish fillet
before, had a deep understanding.

Depending on the ingredients and finished products, mystical dishes or
cocktails brought different negative effects, but they were
significantly weaker than those a Contractee experienced.

"No." Ludwig quickly shook his head. "As long as you fully embrace
hunger and greed, there won't be an upper limit."

*This upper limit is a little crazy... However, this also means that
there's no limit to the number of negative effects. Even if each one is
far inferior to the ones brought about by a Contractee, they will
undergo a qualitative change after stacking...* Lumian pondered
for a moment and looked at Ludwig, who had roughly finished his meal.

"That first time we met, when I saw you chowing down on rats, were you
just a Glutton or a Gourmet?"

Ludwig didn't try to hide anything.

"Gourmet."

*Indeed, he'd been critiquing the dishes I served him...* Lumian
pondered for a moment, then said, "Did you recover to Chef status during
that Batings Black Insect incident?"

Ludwig curtly confirmed it.

"I was just short to begin with. Eating a Batings Black Insect was all
it took to advance."

"What's the next Sequence?" Lumian steered the conversation back on
track.

Ludwig dredged up the memories.

"It's Depriver."

"Depriver?" Lumian immediately thought of the Deprivation Bullet he'd
gotten from Jebus.

*Could this be a transaction from the cult of the Gourmet
pathway?*

Ludwig thought Lumian wanted him to explain the Depriver's abilities. He
recounted, "A Depriver can strip one to three abilities from a target
for a period of time. If they then consume part of the target's flesh,
they permanently gain one of those abilities, and the target permanently
loses it unless they drink a potion again or kill me---no, the
corresponding Depriver.

"At Depriver, our recipes get way more range. A ton of formerly inedible
things become food. We can consume things we previously couldn't."

"Give me an example?" Lumian wasn't sure his interpretation matched
Ludwig's intentions.

Ludwig looked at him and offered two examples.

"Corruption to a certain degree, as well as fireballs, lightning, and
other energy forms."

*They can eat way more dangerous stuff and consume things that shouldn't
even be considered food...* Lumian thought of an enemy he'd
faced at the Hostel and something Ludwig just mentioned. He asked for
confirmation, "So that ability to process ingredients includes those
ingredients too?"

"Yes," Ludwig admitted candidly.

Lumian pulled the matte Deprivation Bullet from his Traveler's Bag and
set it on the dining table.

"This is from a Depriver?"

Ludwig's eyes lit up.

"Yes."

He said anxiously, "Can I... can I use it as a prize? I don't want that
Beyonder characteristic anymore!"

"I think Beyonder characteristics are way more valuable," Lumian
deliberately provoked him.

Ludwig looked sad and said reluctantly, "But I can only choose one.

"I can't actually consume Beyonder characteristics yet. I can only use
them as ingredients for now."

*Is that right...* Lumian eyed Ludwig and organized his
thoughts.

"How much more do you need to eat to recover to Depriver?"

"The further along I go, the harder it gets. I can't just eat a ton. I
need higher quality, higher energy foods." Ludwig pointed at the
Deprivation Bullet. "I'd need at least 200 of these bullets to reach
Depriver."

Lumian chuckled and whispered devilishly, "What if you ate the Depriver
who made this bullet?"

"I could recover immediately!" Ludwig's eyes lit up.

Lumian's smile widened.

"You don't seem to have strong offensive abilities. I can help you get
the stuff to capture the corresponding Beyonders, but you gotta listen
to me and do what I say before I become a demigod. We need to be totally
in sync.

"That's my promise. You gonna hold up your end of the deal?"

Ludwig hesitated a moment before reluctantly nodding.

"Deal."

*Phew, stay calm... This is just the start of the "taming," not the end.
Long process ahead...* Lumian suppressed his smile and asked
curiously, "Who were you following back then?

"No need for the full title. Just call them something like 'the Great
Mother.'"

Ludwig was caught off guard.

His expression shifted a few times before tears streamed down his face.
He wailed like a child.

"I-I don't remember!

"I've forgotten. I've forgotten everything!"

Hearing his cries, Lugano emerged from the guest room in a thick coat.

The Doctor immediately noticed Lumian and asked in confusion, "Why is he
crying?"

*Is this really the terrifying cannibal from the Dream
Festival?*

Lumian chuckled in response.

"I showed him delicacies but didn't give him any."

"Alright..." Lugano looked between them in confusion before retreating
back to his room.

Lugano's brief appearance made Lumian remember an item, and he had a
dangerous thought.

He pulled the remains of Omebella's umbilical cord from his Traveler's
Bag and "consulted" Ludwig, who'd gradually stopped sobbing.

"What dishes and cocktails could you make with this?"

That umbilical cord left behind by the Great Mother's Child of God was
thought to be just an ingredient for charms, mystical items, and
Beyonder weapons. But now Lumian figured a Gourmet might see it
differently.

Looking at Omebella's umbilical cord remains, Ludwig licked his lips.

"It could make three types of food with different mystical effects.

"One food would completely cure infertility."

"Don't need that," Lumian said in amusement. "What about the other two
foods?"

Ludwig said professionally, "One grants potent self-healing abilities,
though inferior to a Vampire's.

"And another..."
