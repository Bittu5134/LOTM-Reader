## Chapter 199: "Unruly"

Travis Everett concealed his emotions behind the black-framed glasses,
rendering them inscrutable.

Nevertheless, he made no attempt to halt Lumian's actions. It was as
though he had transformed into a mere observer.

Baron Brignais, "Blood Palm" Black, and the rest were taken aback by
Lumian's reaction. They couldn't fathom his audacity to splash coffee at
"Black Scorpion" Roger in front of the superintendent and sabotage the
mediation.

In particular, Baron Brignais felt as though he was encountering his
former subordinate, now colleague, for the very first time.

*Is he far more unruly and reckless than I had anticipated?*

*Does he refuse to accept any grievances and is unwilling to pay any
price?*

Although he attempted to shift the blame onto "Black Scorpion" Roger and
the others, it was evident to anyone with a modicum of sense and
perception that Lumian was the instigator of the conflict, driven by a
strong will of his own.

Clearly, he had no intention of reconciliation. He sought only an excuse
to undermine Superintendent Everett's proposal.

*Is this not a blatant slap in Superintendent Everett's face?*

The superintendent wielded considerable influence in the market
district. A slight embellishment in reporting to higher authorities, or
rather, stating the unvarnished truth, would draw the attention of
official Beyonders and dismantle all our enterprises, including the
leaders of the Savoie Mob!

Incensed, "Baldy" Harman denied Lumian the opportunity to shatter the
coffee cup on his boss. He lunged forward, stooped down, grasped the
coffee table's edge, hoisted it, and flung it at the detestable
individual.

Cups clattered to the ground, splintering into shards. Lumian deftly
evaded the projectiles, swiftly drawing his black revolver from beneath
his arm. He trained it on Harman amid the cacophonous crash of objects
and the ensuing chaos.

"Baldy" Harman chuckled, a product of his extreme rage.

"You country hog, do you spurn Superintendent Everett's gracious offer
of mediation?

"Very well then, our Poison Spur Mob shall entertain you until one of us
is vanquished from this game!

"Go ahead, fire away. Your audacity and lack of respect towards
Superintendent Everett know no bounds. If you possess such ability, then
pull the trigger!"

Were it not for the impending election and the stringent surveillance
imposed by officials, the Poison Spur Mob would have long seized an
opportunity to assassinate Ciel!

In that instant, "Black Scorpion" Roger rose once more. Black flames
materialized within his clenched fists, only to dissipate swiftly.

He was reluctant to unveil his Beyonder powers in the presence of
Superintendent Everett.

"Short-legged Candlestick" Castina also fixed her gaze on Lumian, poised
to strike if he refused to relent.

Upon hearing "Baldy" Harman's retort and provocation, Lumian chuckled.

*Bang!*

Lumian squeezed the trigger, unleashing a yellow bullet hurtling
directly towards "Baldy" Harman's skull.

The audacity of Ciel's action caught Harman off guard. He never expected
him to open fire in the presence of Superintendent Everett, defying all
rules and driven solely by the desire to end his life.

His reflexes barely saved him. Harman crouched down just in time, his
eyes widening in alarm.

The bullet grazed his glistening scalp and careened off, ricocheting
into the adjacent washroom with a metallic clang.

In an instant, all the mob leaders sprang to their feet. "Black
Scorpion" Roger and "Short-legged Candlestick" Castina fixated on
Lumian, preparing to retaliate.

Undeterred, Lumian remained resolute. He lowered his gun and aimed it
once more at "Baldy" Harman, his gaze devoid of any emotion.

"Enough!"

At that very moment, Superintendent Everett, who had been calmly seated,
spoke up.

The indescribable authority emanating from him, combined with his
esteemed position, compelled Lumian to instinctively halt his finger
from pulling the trigger.

Seizing the opportunity, "Baldy" Harman shifted his position and rose to
his feet.

Though the others maintained their combative stance, the palpable
tension that had lingered dissipated.

Lamenting his missed chance, Lumian reluctantly holstered his revolver
and turned to face Everett.

"Superintendent, I am willing to comply with your request, but they
don't seem inclined to do so."

Everett's eyes flickered behind his black-framed spectacles. Standing
up, he surveyed the room.

"We will address your conflict after the election.

"For the next three days, I expect all of you to conduct yourselves
properly. Fail to do so, and you shall make an enemy out of me. Trust
me, that's a predicament you won't be able to handle."

Although Everett's voice carried depth, his tone remained calm, devoid
of anger or arrogance. Instead, a hint of sincerity permeated his words.

Yet, those who had resided in the market district for more than two
years recalled a term: the "Valiant Mob."

Two years prior, the Valiant Mob held a similar status to the Savoie Mob
in the market district. However, due to their repeated defiance and
disrespect towards Superintendent Everett, they were ruthlessly
eradicated in a joint operation conducted by the authorities. The
subsequent rise of the Poison Spur Mob was partly due to the power
vacuum left behind in the district's underworld.

Now, only the Valiant café stood as a testament to the existence of such
a mob.

The leaders of the Savoie Mob, the Poison Spur Mob, and the other two
medium-sized gangs fell into silence for a few seconds before responding
to Superintendent Everett's words. They expressed their commitment to
restrain their subordinates and ensure that the election proceeded
without disruption.

Superintendent Everett's gaze swept across their faces. Without uttering
another word, he strode towards the exit of the private room.

As he disappeared beyond the door, "Black Scorpion" Roger, "Baldy"
Harman, and "Short-legged Candlestick" Castina cast Lumian cold glances
before departing from the café.

The remaining gang leaders didn't linger, leaving only the Savoie Mob in
the confines of the private room.

Baron Brignais took a leisurely puff from his pipe and addressed Lumian,
"You acted too impulsively back there."

Lumian offered a faint smile in response and replied, "I have been
awaiting an opportunity like that. Unfortunately, I couldn't seize it to
incite the conflict."

Observing the puzzled expressions on the faces of "Giant" Simon, "Blood
Palm" Black, and the others, Lumian calmly elaborated, "We have already
made two attempts, and the Poison Spur Mob chose to endure. Baron, as
you have rightly pointed out, they harbor a significant problem, and
they await their chance. I believe that opportunity will present itself
soon.

"If we fail to incapacitate the Poison Spur Mob before then, we shall
face their unhinged retaliation. And when that moment arrives, none of
you will be able to escape.

"Just a moment ago, there were only three members of the Poison Spur Mob
present, while we numbered five. Red Boots, your strength is comparable
to that of Black Scorpion. With my assistance, you can surely overpower
him. Baron, Simon, Black, is it conceivable that you cannot handle Baldy
and Short-legged Candlestick? One of you might even be able to impede
Superintendent Everett.

"As long as the Poison Spur Mob dares to strike back, we shall eliminate
them all right here!"

"Rat" Christo had received instructions from Superintendent Everett the
previous night that he was not to be invited today.

Baron Brignais, "Blood Palm" Black, and their comrades found Ciel's
words reasonable, yet a deep-seated fear for this individual arose
within their hearts.

He wasn't bluffing. He genuinely desired to eliminate "Baldy" Harman and
the others!

He was too crazy and extreme!

He possessed the audacity to commit any act without hesitation!

"But this is tantamount to slapping Superintendent Everett in the face.
The repercussions will be exceedingly troublesome." "Blood Palm" Black
shook his head.

Franca shared the same concern. She wished to caution Lumian that such a
course of action would render him unwelcome in the market district. He
might even end up with another wanted poster.

However, recognizing that the other leaders were present and unable to
reveal her true friendship with Lumian, Franca sealed her lips.

A quizzical smile played on Lumian's lips as he inquired, "Wasn't
Superintendent Everett killed by the Poison Spur Mob?"

*Lunatic...* This notion raced through everyone's minds.

Baron Brignais, gently stroking his mahogany-colored pipe, chimed in,
"It's nearly impossible to conceal that from official Beyonders. It's
merely an excuse."

"In that case, let it go. Blame everything on a lunatic like me. At
worst, I'll depart from the market district. I trust the Boss will
arrange another task for me once this storm blows over," Lumian calmly
remarked, a serene smile gracing his face.

This was indeed a fragment of his genuine thoughts.

Mr. K's mission revolved around earning Gardner Martin's trust, not
running Salle de Bal Brise or establishing a foothold in the market
district!

If his provocation had genuinely enraged "Black Scorpion" Roger and his
accomplices, Lumian believed that Franca would surely come to his aid.
With one of the Savoie Mob's leaders on his side, the others wouldn't
hesitate to act. When the time came, united in strength, they stood a
high chance of eliminating the remaining three leaders of the Poison
Spur Mob.

Once he unraveled the Poison Spur Mob's scheme, Gardner Martin would
undoubtedly appreciate Lumian's daring and unorthodox approach in
eradicating hidden threats. Even if he lost Salle de Bal Brise and was
compelled to "escape" once more, he would merely find sanctuary
elsewhere in Trier and continue serving Gardner Martin until he gained
his complete approval.

Furthermore, it was advantageous for Lumian. If the Poison Spur Mob
finalized their preparations, he would be their primary target for
revenge. Failing to address the issue beforehand would only heighten the
danger he faced. In the future, even if Madame Moon birthed another
group, Lumian wouldn't fret. Today, Louis Lund would likely be present
in the market district. By temporarily suppressing the deaths of "Black
Scorpion" Roger and his cronies, creating a façade of tranquility,
Lumian could patiently await his target at 126 Avenue du Marché.

These individuals weren't parliamentary candidates whose demise would
incite an uproar.

After a few moments of silence, Baron Brignais approached the door and
issued a reminder, "Superintendent Everett has probably marked you.
There will be considerable trouble after the election."

Lumian responded with a smile, "Perhaps he will mysteriously vanish one
day."

Having said that, Lumian calmly endured the mildly apprehensive gazes of
"Giant" Simon and his comrades.

*You see, having laid the groundwork, anything I utter now will convince
them all.*

†

At 3:15 p.m., Lumian arrived at Quartier du Jardin Botanique in a public
carriage. Once again, he beheld Mason Café, housed in a beige four-story
building adorned with lush green plants entwined on its outer walls.

Passing through a sheltered walkway upheld by pillars, he entered the
interior, enveloped by dark-green walls and expansive windows. Settling
into the familiar Booth D, he removed his wide-brimmed round hat.

"A cup of Intis coffee," he instructed the waitress and patiently
waited.
