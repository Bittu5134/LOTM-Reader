## Chapter 175: Hidden Blade

Lumian stepped into the room, shutting the door behind him, the dark-red
wood closing off the outside world. He turned to Franca and asked, "Are
you here to see the baron or me?"

Franca leaned back in the chair, stretching her body.

However, the swivel chair tilted slightly, leaving the ground and
wobbling uncertainly.

"Care to guess why I'm here? For you or him?" Her voice cut through the
air, clear and distinct, in stark contrast to her elegant appearance and
demeanor. "Gardner initially wanted you to be Brignais's deputy, to see
if you were capable of handling more than just fighting. I told him then
that Brignais hasn't been very obedient lately."

Lumian nodded, a sudden realization dawning on him. Aurore was right. A
comment made in bed could play a significant role...

His confusion from earlier, on Rue des Fontaines, began to dissipate.
How could the boss be so generous as to take away one of Baron
Brignais's most prized "property" and hand it over to an outsider like
him?

Salle de Bal Brise was the most popular dance hall in the entire market
district!

Initially, Lumian had contemplated mocking Franca's masculine sitting
posture, but the thought of her true gender made him reconsider. He
clicked his tongue and remarked, "So, I should be thanking you?"

"No need for that. After all, you saved Jenna," Franca replied, smiling
as she shook her right foot on her left ankle. "I came here for two
reasons. First, I wanted to assure you that I understand the distinction
between kindness and animosity. I will surely repay kindness. Second, I
wanted to warn you not to harbor any intentions toward Jenna."

The latter half of her sentence carried a clear warning that she would
seek revenge for any offense.

Lumian couldn't help but chuckle.

"Are you lacking confidence? If you manage to make Jenna infatuated with
you, nothing I do will change her feelings."

Had Lumian not known about the potential gender transformation through
the Demoness pathway, he might have taunted Franca, asking if her
confidence solely relied on her dick. He might have mocked her
insecurity and her need to caution an unrelated individual. What did she
think Jenna was? Someone who would easily change her heart? Lumian could
almost visualize Jenna treating Franca as a friend rather than a lover.

Gradually, Franca's smile faded. She withdrew her feet and rose from her
chair.

Despite being slightly shorter than Lumian, she stood at an impressive
height of almost 1.75 meters, a rarity among Intisian women.

Franca circled the desk, drawing closer to Lumian. A smirk formed on her
lips as she said, "If you're in need of women, I can introduce you to
some of my top dancers. And if they don't catch your fancy, how about
me?"

As she spoke, she gently hooked her hand around Lumian's chin, lowering
it slowly.

Lumian's heart remained calm, undisturbed like a still lake. The
realization that this woman may have once been a man had extinguished
any desire within him. He simply resisted, firmly gripping Franca's
right hand and offering a smile.

"I'm afraid the boss would have me sleeping with the fishes at the
bottom of the Srenzo River."

Changing the topic, Lumian continued, "So, you swing both ways? Men and
women?"

Franca withdrew her hand, straightened up, and offered a smile.

"I used to fancy girls exclusively, but after giving it a try with a
man, I realized it's not half bad. It brings about a different
sensation.

"Life's too short to impose limits upon oneself. Break free from
unnecessary restrictions and explore. You'll have more fun and live a
truly different life."

It seems as if Franca had indeed been a man in the past. Is she now a
Sequence 7 Witch? And why did her last sentence sound so familiar? In
the midst of his pondering, Lumian responded to Franca,

"I don't hold any special feelings for Jenna, nor do I intend to. I have
far more pressing matters to attend to."

"Very well." Franca strode toward the door.

Just as her hand reached for the handle, Lumian's memory was suddenly
jogged, and he finally recalled the source of Franca's words.

It had been mentioned by Aurore in his dream!

She spoke of a member of the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society who
had contemplated the idea of becoming an Assassin and had consumed the
corresponding potion. However, at the Witch Sequence, he found himself
in a quandary, unsure whether to undergo a gender transformation.
Another member of the society had advised him, saying, "Life is short,
why not give it a try?""

It was the very essence of what Franca had condensed into those words!

Lumian's heart stirred as he gazed upon Franca's graceful figure. He
spoke in a deep, resonant voice, "Life is short, why not give it a try?"

Franca's hand froze on the doorknob, and she stood there, as if struck
by lightning.

After a few seconds, she spun around, locking her gaze with Lumian's,
her voice tinged with anxiety.

"Who are you? What's your code name?"

*This reaction... It appears my guess was correct!* Lumian felt
a surge of delight followed by a sinking feeling in his heart.

"I'm Muggle's brother."

Upon hearing Ciel accurately mention the code name of one of the members
of the Curly-Haired Baboons Research Society, Franca breathed a sigh of
relief and said,

"I'm not sure if your sister mentioned me, but my code name is Hidden
Blade. I belong to the same secret organization as her. No, she must
have mentioned me! Otherwise, you wouldn't be familiar with that phrase.
Damn it all, what the hell is happening!"

Lumian shut his eyes and spoke with a resolute tone, "She never
mentioned your code name or identity because I chose the Hunter pathway.
When she reminded me about the neighboring Demoness pathway and its
potential for gender transformation, she used your experience as an
example."

"So, you do know..." Franca felt a strong urge to disappear into the
depths of the sewers.

Despite having adapted to her current form and overcoming her
self-imposed limitations, her newfound enjoyment with men was contingent
upon her previous gender remaining a secret.

The notion that Ciel knew about her past as a man, and her penchant for
intimate relations with men, ignited a dangerous thought within her.

*The dead can keep secrets... The dead will forget... The dead won't
mock me...*

After a few seconds, Franca let out a slow exhale and said, "It would be
wise for you to forget this. If you weren't Muggle's brother, I would
have ensured your permanent disappearance."

At that moment, she projected her true, masculine side, casting her gaze
toward the future.

"Let me enlighten you about the Hunter pathway. It, too, involves a
gender change. I paid a steep price to acquire this knowledge. Unlike
Demonesses, Hunters transition from women to men. It likely occurs at
Sequence 4. When the time comes, I will switch paths, become a Hunter,
and reclaim my male form!"

*Is that so... Hunters symbolize males, while Demonesses represent
females? No wonder they are neighboring paths... *Lumian
restrained his emotions and let out a chuckle.

"When that time arrives, how will you face the men you were once
intimately involved with?"

Franca's expression turned smug as she unveiled her well-devised plan.

"I will administer them the Witch potion. If they are Beyonders unable
to transition to the Demoness pathway, I will find a way to transform
the characteristics of a Witch Bounded characteristic into mystical
items for them to wear. And then, when the time is ripe, hehe..."

*Madame, you're somewhat deranged...* Lumian dared not further
provoke the Red Boots.

This individual seemed capable of anything!

As he expected, Franca issued a threat, "I'll emphasize once again, it's
in your best interest to forget about this matter and refrain from
harboring any intentions toward Jenna. Otherwise, I will apprehend you
and force the Witch potion down your throat! Though Sequence 7 may not
grant the ability to switch pathways, it does make one even more
dangerous. It might not result in half-crazed madness or loss of
control."

Visualizing such a scenario, Lumian hastened to nod and made a solemn
pledge, "You are my sister's friend. I will surely keep your secret."

Franca relaxed and inquired about Muggle, "Where is Muggle? Is she also
in Trier? Is she strikingly beautiful in reality?"

Lumian fell into silence. After a few seconds, he spoke in a hoarse
voice, "She passed away. You must have seen the wanted posters. In that
calamity, she..."

Franca parted her lips, but no words escaped them.

She returned to Lumian's side and gently patted his shoulder, offering
solace.

After a moment, Franca dabbed at the corners of her eyes and spoke,
"Ever since I became a woman, it seems my tear ducts have become more
active... I can't fathom that Muggle departed from us so suddenly.
Whenever we gathered, she exuded gentleness, brilliance, humor, and
kindness. Though I've never laid eyes on her true form, I believe she
must be incredibly beautiful..."

With a regained composure, Lumian gazed at Franca and said, "Madame
Hidden Blade, I request that you keep this matter under wraps for the
time being. Do not divulge it to other members of your organization. It
could impact my investigation into the truth behind the catastrophe."

In a slightly nasal tone, Franca replied, "No problem."

Lumian observed Franca's shimmering eyes resembling tranquil lakes and
contemplated before posing his next question, "How many encounters did
you have with my sister over the past year?"

"Only once. Why do you ask?" Franca inquired, puzzled.

Lumian continued, "Did she exhibit any peculiar behavior or interact
with any unusual individuals?"

"No," Franca shook her head. "It was a regular gathering where we
exchanged knowledge of mysticism and traded items. We belong to
different factions---she's part of the Academy, and I am affiliated with
the Sanctuary. Our gatherings rarely coincide."

Lumian refrained from further inquiries. Seeking to gain something from
the situation, he spoke with a mindset of extracting information,
"Madame Hidden Blade, I am currently studying the grimoire left behind
by my sister, but there are numerous sections that elude my
understanding. Might I seek your guidance?"

"Certainly," Franca disclosed her address. "I reside in the penthouse at
3 Rue des Blouses Blanches, Room 601. You can find me during Jenna's
performances. Every evening, unless I am at Rue des Fontaines or
visiting various dance halls, I will be at home. Also, please refrain
from using my code name. Just refer to me as Franca."

*Why does it feel like we're engaged in a clandestine affair behind
Jenna's back...* Lumian criticized inwardly, feeling perplexed.
He voiced his puzzlement, "Franca, you possess the backing of that
secret organization, and you are not lacking in strength yourself. Why
did you join the mob?"

Franca grinned and playfully winked her left eye. "Secret."
